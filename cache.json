During the Vietnam War period, however, another diabolical concoction called Agent Blue was also used extensively in Vietnam. This arsenic-based herbicide was used to kill rice and the public knew little about its use. In fact, the first news reference to this chemical weapon was a simple letter to the editor sent by Arthur H. Westing in 1971 and published by the New York Times under the headline “‘Agent Blue’ in Vietnam.” More\nThe post Vietnam Chemical Warfare’s Secret Toxic Legacies: Agent Blue appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "> That's 50 people serving the needs of 1,000,000. Doing a little bit of division, that means that every single member of the Flutter team is responsible for the needs of 20,000 Flutter developers! That ratio is clearly unworkable for any semblance of customer support.\nIf \"only\" 50 people working on a project used by one million people was unworkably low then every single successful project out there would be doomed. I've certainly worked on things with much worse ratios than that.\n> one has to critically assess why a team that loves external contributions has only managed to merge contributions from 1,500 developers over a span of nearly a decade.\nExternal contributions from 1500 developers over a decade is a lot. That is an unusually high number, not a low one, and backs up Flutter's claim to love external contributions.\nThe fact that this person thinks that they can just magically conjure up dozens of volunteer PR reviewers is wild. Everything about this post makes it pretty clear that they don't have the slightest clue of the scope of what they're trying to do. This feels like one of the standard examples of an ex-bigco person setting off on their own with no understanding how just how much the bigco did in the background to facilitate their job.",

And then he encountered the registration form for a WordPress.org login, which neatly specifies that you affirm you have no “affiliation with WP Engine, whether financial or otherwise.” [1]\nOf course, my company does have an affiliation with WP Engine. We use their service to host our website. Therefore, nobody on my team can register for a WordPress.org account.\nI wrote an open letter to Matt Mullenweg complaining about the requirement and stating that I believe it violates the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by being an overly broad prohibition that is clearly anti-competitive and has no clear business justification (aside from limiting competition).\nMatt and the rest of the people backing Automattic should take note: Moves like this that destroy your community will eventually usher in a replacement. WordPress is pretty neat, but it only got that way because thousands of people put millions of hours into building add-ons and hosting services to make it blossom into what it is today. If their efforts are redirected in another direction, WordPress will wither away to nothing in a few years.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ksimpson_open-letter-to-matt-...",

We organize large meetings were we discuss architecture and city planning with politicians, architects and property developers on stage.\nI am strongly inspired by Create Streets in UK and Strong Towns in the US. I want to improve people’s quality of life, help saving the planet and make Norway beautiful again while doing it.\nhttps://arkitekturopproret.no edit: typos",

And since he comes to me every time he wants a new coloring book and we spend about 10 minutes together searching for each picture, I made a website with a collection of coloring books for him. The site is very simple, but to be honest, I haven't had so much fun with the process of creation for a long time.\nhttps://colorango.com/",

I never got into these types of programmatic games for precisely this reason but I'd like to understand other perspectives on this.\nThe games I play instead are wholly unrelated to my work life, such as FPS or RPG ones, where there is a clear distinction between what I can do and what I want to do.",

The apps crawl the network of hosts and aggregate activity. We have over 100 outside hosts and at least 3 aggregating apps out there. It’s a different model than ActivityPub, which is more akin to email.\nWe never said no algorithm. I don’t know where that meme comes from. We have an open system for algorithms, which we and 3p devs can operate. We have a default algorithm for every user called Discover. It was one of our main concerns to have an answer to algorithms in a decentralized network.\nFor DID PLC, the likely solution is to move the registry into a nonprofit which will maintain it, similar to ICANN.

I then begged our company’s CISO to investigate and it turns out we had some firewall setting on UniFi that blocked the domain because it appeared on a list. Once I checked way back, it turns out that it was as an anime porn aggregator years back.

          "description": "Nice! I peeked at the code and thought I’d share a few tips for improving the low frame rate:\nBase64 encoding the JPEG bytes will increase payload size up to ~30% and burns CPU cycles on both client and server. This is unnecessary, as Websocket protocol can send binary payloads (doesn’t need to be text).\nConsider removing lossy jpg compression as well, ie just send the raw RGB bytes over the network. Then on the server side you can simply call Image.frombuffer(…).\nStreamDiffusion can achieve high frame rates because of extensive batching in the pipeline. You’re not benefiting from that here as the client is only sending one frame at a time and then waiting for a response. See this example for an idea of how to queue input frames and consume them in batches https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion/blob/main/e... .\nAlternatively you could take a look at the SDXL Turbo and Lightning models. They are very fast at img2img but have limited resolution of 512² or 1024² pixels respectively. Which appears a bit lower than what you’re aiming for here, but they can be run locally in real time on a high end consumer grade GPU. For reference I have some code demonstrating this here https://github.com/GradientSurfer/Draw2Img/tree/main",

In my opinion Kahle was wrong; the existence of one orphan works clearinghouse would have encouraged Congress to grant more libraries access instead of doing nothing which is what actually happened in the 15 year since then. Instead of one company selling out-of-print but in-copyright books, or multiple organizations, no one is allowed to sell them today.\nSince then, of course, Brewster Kahle launched an e-library of copyrighted books without legal authorization anyway which will probably be the death of the current organization that runs the Internet Archive. Tragic all around.",

The HathiTrust is better about letting the public read books that have actually fallen into the public domain. I have found many books that are \"snippet view\" only on Google Books but freely visible on HathiTrust.\nIf you are a student or researcher at one of the participating HathiTrust institutions, you can also get access to scans of books that are still in copyright.\nThe one advantage Google Books still has is that its search tools are much faster and sometimes better, so it can be useful to search for phrases or topics on Google Books and then jump over to HathiTrust to read specific books surfaced by the search.\n[1] https://www.hathitrust.org/",

Running on Windows. Using MFC forms.\nMy accountant showed me Cantax - a very powerful software package they use to prepare tax returns in Canada. Also on Windows.\nI started to realize that pretty much most of the real world runs on software that directly interfaces with people, without clearly defined public APIs you can integrate into. Being in the SaaS space makes you believe that everyone ought to have client-server backend APIs etc.\nBoy was I wrong.\nI am glad they did this, since it is a powerful connector to these types of real-world business use cases that are super-hairy, and hence very worthwhile in automating.",

          "description": "I used to struggle with explaining why some of my friends or family members didn’t quite fit into any of the 16 MBTI personality types. A friend of mine seemed like an INFP but had traits of an ISTJ, and my cousin felt like an ESFP, yet was as considerate as an ESFJ.\nThen I stumbled upon Personality Ninja (or \"NXT\"), which uses 32 types instead of just 16. Suddenly, things started to make sense.\nAt first, I thought, “What? There are only 16 types!” But after trying it out with friends, I realized their new descriptions actually felt accurate. This system offered flexibility and depth the original 16 types didn’t seem to capture.\nCurious, I dove deeper into whether 32 types could really work—and found out there’s no reason they can’t! If you look back at Carl Jung, who created the concept of cognitive functions, he didn’t enforce the rigid stacks we see in MBTI or the Harold Grant function model.\nPersonality Ninja’s approach allows both the first and second functions to be in the same attitude (both extraverted or both introverted), unlike MBTI’s requirement for them to be opposites.\nThis flexibility means types don’t have to follow TeSi or SiTe formats—they can be TeSe or SiTi. It was the answer I’d been looking for: my friend turned out to be FiSi, while my cousin was FeSe.\nSo if you’ve ever felt stuck trying to fit yourself or others into the 16 types, it might be worth exploring the 32-type approach!",

We don't like a song, so we skip to the next one. We find a blog post difficult to read, so we activate reading mode.\nBut it's not always possible for us to change the situation, no matter how much we would like to. Then the other option remains: to accept the situation.\nNot in a resigned and negative way. Nor in a false way by convincing ourselves that everything is fine. But simply with a truthful view of the situation as it is right now, in this moment.\nIt pretty much comes down to both these choices we have in life:\nChange\nAcceptance\nYou want a higher salary, so you try to change the situation by asking for a raise. If it's accepted, the situation is resolved.

It's true. It makes it a more magical reading experience.\nI only have a few issues of Cow Eyes, since it's all the way from Australia, but i cherish every issue. She writes zines with her typewriter and fills them with drawings, poetry, short stories, and bits of thoughts from her diary.\n\ncow eye issue 2\nYou can get both of these zines at: Small Zine Volcano.\nGive the convo a listen, I promise, it's a good one ;)",
