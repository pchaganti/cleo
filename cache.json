          "description": "The Course of Empire by Thomas Cole\n\nSo, there were protests in L.A. over Trump’s immigrant removal strategy, some turned violent and Trump is calling in the National Guard and talking about using the military.\nIt’s worth pointing out that Trump has deported less undocumented immigrants than Biden did over comparable periods. This isn’t about deportation, as such.\nWhat it is about is Gestapo tactics: sending people to torture prisons without due process; wearing masks and refusing to show badges or warrants; giving ICE the right to create its own warrants without judicial oversight (clearly unconstitutional); seizing people who are showing up for meetings at immigration facilities or immigrant courts.\nIt’s not what Trump is doing, it’s how he’s doing it—in the cruelest, most lawless and un…",

While China is providing some licenses for Rare Earths, they’re slow walking them and customs approval, and I’ve been told (though cannot confirm) that so far they have given none to Indian companies. (Maybe that little Pakistan kerfuffle wasn’t cost free?)\nThis is all very amusing and instructive on a number of levels. America banned something that China could handle the bans on: semiconductors. China, after much provocation, banned something that there is simply no way of replacing in the next few years:\n“There is no solution for the next three years except to come to an agreement with China,” said Andreas Kroll, managing director of Noble Elements, rare earths importer for medium-sized…",

          "description": "One of the simplest lenses to look at an industrial society is whether it’s run by financiers or capitalists.\nSocrates famously noted that some people live to eat and others eat to live.\nCapitalists need money so they can do things. Financiers do things so they can get money. To a financier it doesn’t matter how money is made, so long as they won’t go to prison. All that matters is rate of return.\nA capitalist has something they want to do: Ford wanted to build cars. Edison wanted to invent. The Wright Brothers wanted to fly. They need money so they can do whatever it is that turns their crank.\nCapitalists create great societies. Financiers destroy them.\nAs soon as rate of return becomes the only consideration, a society becomes less interested in doing new things or doing old things well …",
