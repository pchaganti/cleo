He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him.

Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.\n2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear/similar objective.\nMeet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…\nOr is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.\nTo the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.\nI’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree/number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.\nSomeone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree/number theory/inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.",

          "description": "I think there’s one flaw in the overall theory presented in the article: it was demand for coal for heating independent of the industrial revolution that really kickstarted things and the labor exploited for coal mining was the lowest of the socioeconomic classes. Before the industrial revolution England was already mining around five times more coal than the rest of the world combined just to survive winters. Once they exhausted the easy surface deposits they had to go deeper and deeper which required mechanized power to work against the water seeping in. The first engines were invented not when labor became too expensive but when it was impossible to do with human labor at all.\nAfter reading Coal - A Human History I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs and a surface supply of coal just big enough to get the industry started but not enough to supply the growing population without digging deeper.",

          "description": "Wasn't expecting my question to hit top of HN. I guess I'll give some context for why I asked it.\nI work in quantum error correction, and was trying to collect interesting and quantitative examples of repetition codes being used implicitly in classical systems. Stuff like DRAM storing a 0 or 1 via the presence or absence of 40K electrons [1], undersea cables sending X photons per bit (don't know that one yet), some kind of number for a transistor switching (haven't even decided on the number for that one yet), etc.\nA key reason quantum computing is so hard is that by default repetition makes things worse instead of better, because every repetition is another chance for an unintended measurement. So protecting a qubit tends to require special physical properties, like the energy gap of a superconductor, or complex error correction strategies like surface codes. A surface code can easily use 1000 physical qubits to store 1 logical qubit [2], and I wanted to contrast that with the sizes of implicit repetition codes used in classical computing.\n1: https://web.mit.edu/rec/www/dramfaq/DRAMFAQ.html\n2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928",

At my current job, I was working in a high rise office building with sixty-six floors.\nThe operating system computer was a JC8520, which was running a version of MS-DOS. All commands had to be typed in correctly or nothing would happen. While operating the plant, several commands had to be entered every shift, since the owners didn't purchase a very automated package.\nIn the interview for the data center job, I was asked if I had any experience with Windows. I didn't understand the question because I wasn't aware they were talking about a computer operating system! So, I replied at the office building I worked in there were outside contractors who cleaned the windows.\nAfter my reply all seven of the interviewers were all grinning and I was aware I said something they weren't looking for. One of the men politely told me Windows  was a computer operating system. My reply was, \"Oh, I see.\"\nWhen I returned home I told my wife what happened and we shouldn't get our hopes up. To my utter shock, a week later I was offered the job, which I took and after some training, learned something I didn't know before.",

Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before. Probably as a concession to France, the chats of employees of security authorities and the military are also to be exempted from chat control.\n----\nStrange times we live in.

Epoxy probably yields a more robust bond and certainly allows for quicker repairs, but I question its safety for food-related use, especially at the temperatures found in a steaming cup of coffee.\nPeople opt for epoxy because Urushi lacquer is traditionally made from poison oak sap and is a potent skin irritant to most people (it's where urushiol gets its name). It's really tough to do Kintsugi without smearing trace amounts of it all over the place, especially if you're doing it with kids, and cleaning it off is a pain since it's a hydrophobic sap. Even trace amounts can cause a reaction, especially if someone has sensitive skin or is severely allergic. People who do a lot of kintsugi develop a tolerance for it but it's an annoyance that most hobbyists just don't need.\nEpoxies can be perfectly food safe and the FDA has a database [1] although it's not particularly user friendly. You can get MAX CLR or similar from Amazon. I wouldn't use it in an oven above 300F but it's fine for boiling temps. These FDA approved two part epoxies are used all over the place in hospitals and food manufacturing facilities where they're used to coat rough surfaces that would otherwise harbor bacteria.\n[1] https://www.cfsanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=Indi...",

It blows my mind how different groups fight to offer the best version of a free thing. And they’re so good at it, that the pirated product is usually substantially better than the official version.",

The headline should read: errors.Is() is 500% slower.\nBasically: the critical functions in the benchmark are small enough they were being inlined by the compiler, which means it's possible for the compiler to further optimize the loop to avoid all comparisons in some cases, producing an inaccurate result for some of the benchmarks. You can fix this by adding noinline directives to the methods.\nI'll be publishing an update to the article and a post-mortem on how this slipped past review.

The word \"theft\" doesn't appear even once on https://www.apple.com/airtag.

          "description": "My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.\nWell, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.\nMy old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.\nAnyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.",

          "description": "Today is one of those days when I feel I have nothing to write.\nThen I started thinking...\nWhat is it that says you have to have something to write to start writing? It's just an idea, an idea of how things work.\nYou have something to write.\nYou write it.\nIt doesn't have to be like that. It's perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.\nThere are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...\nIt should be sunny on Midsummer day (it's a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).\nWhen life doesn't go the way it's “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.\nWhat if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things \"should be”? What if we face the day with a little \"let's see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings\"?\nIt's worth trying.\nall posts · rss feed",

He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.\nSometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…",

          "description": "I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn't know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn't that easy.\nAfter he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn't really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…",

In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.\nHe replies:\nYes, it is. I can panic if I'm not allowed to write.\nI think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.\nIf I don't write in one form or another, it's like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn't matter. Just get it out of the system.\nI think it was Stephen King who said something like:\n\"If you don't have time to read, how will you have time to write?”\nFor me, it's the other way around. If I don't write, there's no way I can be fully present and absorb what I'm reading.\nWriting is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.\nFollow: email · rss",

I published the first post, It's alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\nAfter about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I'm not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.\nI tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:\nBear\nPika\nScribbles\nThey are all fantastic! If you're on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!\nFor me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.\nWhen I say \"forever,\" I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it's a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I'm very happy to have found my way back.\nI look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other \"Bears\" publish in this beautiful community.\nHappy blogging!\nall posts · rss feed",

I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I've ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.\nI've also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...\nWhile I'm deciding, please enjoy the croissant button.

Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven't even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.\nThis is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It's not that I don't know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I'll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through 'husband' will catch in my mouth and 'boyfriend' will slip out instead.\nMost of this can be chalked up to unfamiliarity.

One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. \"Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...\"\nTo the contrary - I'm loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.\nIn this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest.

The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. \n The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes.

It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…",
