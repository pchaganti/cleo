The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.",

Its nice to escape from the career you've had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you've lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn't that difficult. You certainly don't need \"millions in equipment\". Its exactly what I did.\nI found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much 'smaller' scale. My company is small and work demands don't dominate my life. I have balance.\nThis year I've planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. \"touching grass\" is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens.",

Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we'd love to see more of.\nA couple important notes:\n1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).\n2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn't been validated or scrutinized yet.\nAll said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We'll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\nEDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this",

It's really cool how it works:\n* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.\n* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn't affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.\nRubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.",

None of them are actually related.\nIt's because the syllable is restricted in the number of possible forms, in a similar way.  (And they all have approximately five vowels.  And a pitch accent.)  In Hawaiian, nothing but consonant + vowel syllables are possible.  Swahili and Japanese allow an optional final n sound.  Finnish is a little more flexible, and syllables can end with an n, r, l or t.  No consonant clusters, in any of the languages.  No syllables ending with consonants outside the restricted set (if any), in any of the languages.\nThis results in a lot of syllables of the form: i, a, ne, na, ka, ta, po, to...  \"Pokatokaino\".  I just made that up and it's probably not a Swahili, Finnish, Hawaiian, or Japanese word -- but it could be.\nThis basic pattern (consonant + vowel + maybe limited option for final consonant) is very common; it's the most common arrangement among the worlds languages.   Far more common than languages like English which allow monstrosities like \"strengths\" (which is 6 consonants and one vowel).",

You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.\nBroadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.\n5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).",

The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.\nWhat's always been funny to me about the scientific approach to animal consciousness/emotions/empathy is that in a perfectly rational world the default assumption would be that animals and humans exist along a spectrum and there isn't a sharp cliff where humans are 100% conscious and empathetic but dogs are 0%. The claim that humans are categorically different than other animals is the extraordinary one, not the claim that we are made of mostly the same stuff.\nThe only reason why animal consciousness has been controversial historically is a religious one—the Bible has typically been read as placing humanity in a category of its own. And yet we see countless secular scientists clinging to that perspective when even a cursory glance at the evidence and a basic application of Occam's razor would suggest the opposite.",

The final dashboard when we stopped said \"216,626 / 216,890 = 99.8%; 264 to go\".\nThe other correction I would make is that this post does not mention Nilton Volpato, who had written an earlier Buildifier and graciously accepted replacing his implementation with a new one and then taking over ownership for that new implementation as well. (Eventually ownership moved to Laurent's team.)\nIt looks like it was just under 2,000 commits. We did pretty extensive testing, by having Blaze load a BUILD file and its transitive closure and then dump that parsed form back out to a binary format. Any automated commit had to preserve that parsed-and-dumped binary format bit for bit. The slowest part of the testing was waiting for Blaze to do all the loads.\nEvery day I would prepare and test as many files as I could, break them into CLs (think PRs), mail Rob a shell script he could run to approve them all, and go to bed. Then I'd get up early in the morning (5am ET) to submit the changes, because there were various cached indexes that got updated when BUILD files got submitted, and it seemed better to send them when not many people would be working.\nThat scheme worked until a system did fall over and someone got paged, and then after that I agreed to only submit the large changes during business hours. :-)",

          "description": "There are two different questions at play here, and we need to be careful what we wish for.\nThe first concern is the most legitimate one: can I stop an LLM from training itself on my data? This should be possible and Perplexity should absolutely make it easy to block them from training.\nThe second concern, though, is can Perplexity do a live web query to my website and present data from my website in a format that the user asks for? Arguing that we should ban this moves into very dangerous territory.\nEverything from ad blockers to reader mode to screen readers do exactly the same thing that Perplexity is doing here, with the only difference being that they tend to be exclusively local. The very nature of a \"user agent\" is to be an automated tool that manipulates content hosted on the internet according to the specifications given to the tool by the user. I have a hard time seeing an argument against Perplexity using this data in this way that wouldn't apply equally to countless tools that we already all use and which companies try with varying degrees of success to block.\nI don't want to live in a world where website owners can use DRM to force me to display their website in exactly the way that their designers envisioned it. I want to be able to write scripts to manipulate the page and present it in a way that's useful for me. I don't currently use llms this way, but I'm uncomfortable with arguing that it's unethical for them to do that so long as they're citing the source.",

A \"tell the chef the food was delicious\".\nWe don't need to exaggerate. We don't have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.\nBut we can actively choose to put kindness first.

          "description": "“You look tired today.”\nIt wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.\nFor the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.\nWe live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.\nAnd so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.\nYou see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.\nBe kind. Be gentle.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. \n After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning.
