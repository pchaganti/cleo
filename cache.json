          "description": "Stumbled on this chart recently:\n\nKind of tells its own story.\nIt’s worth reading the Communist manifest. People have weird ideas about it, but a lot of it is really unexceptionable. For example, Marx and Engels demanded pensions for old folks.\nCapitalists looked at this and said, “oh, we can do this if the alternative is worse” and introduced them. Someone as hard headed as Bismarck responded this way.\nThe threat of a credible enemy ideology which treats ordinary people better than capitalists do forces capitalists to change. For a long time we haven’t had that, but the single party “Marxist but with capitalism” CCP offers another, and yes, they do, overall treat their workers better, as well as being better at capitalism than capitalists. No one is as obsessed with how markets actually work as Marxist economists.\nLet’s look at another of my favorite charts:\n\nOh hey, having powerful organizations taking the part of workers matters.\nSomething happened right after Reagan took power:\n\nStrikes involving more than 1,000 workers\n\nThen there’s this:\n\n(The numbers have gone down since then, but are still vastly high, and far, far higher than China.\nBreak the unions and lock up the people who won’t obey bullshit (aka. drug) laws.\nClass war is real, and constantly ongoing, and elites have won that war.\nPower and fear is all that capitalists ever respond to.\nAlways remember that.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

(I predicted the latter at the time.)\nThen there’s this lovely chart:\n\nWell, well, well. Seems forcing people to do what they don’t want to do, in what is usually a socially oppressive environment, is bad for them.\nThere are, of course, those who thrive in school, and love it, usually the socially dominant kids. But for a lot of kids, school is Hell.\nThis has a lot to do with alignment of goals, I think.

Anyway, tariffs are back to 10% on either side and negotiations will continue.\nNote that China got what they wanted, minus 10%—no negotiations until the tariffs are removed.\nThere will still be a two month trade burp. Ships weren’t leaving China for the US at all, literally zero. Lot of freight companies are about to make a mint, though. So expect some shortages, but nothing worse than Covid, and hopefully lasting less time.\nThe fundamental problem remains, however, which is that there’s no certainty around any of this, so business people can’t make long term plans, including plans to build or relocate manufacturing. Trump and the US can’t be trusted to stay steady on policy, so avoiding making big plans involving the US makes sense.\nThe Great Power picture is clearer, however. The US tried to impose its will on China and failed. China wouldn’t negotiate till its pre-conditions were met. The world has two great powers, with the EU bidding to become the third (I think they’ll fail, but that’s what the rearmament is about.)\nAnd, in economic terms, China is by far the pre-eminent great power. It isn’t even close. The era of American hegemony is officially over. The US tried to impose its will on the world and failed.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

          "description": "2,540 year ago Aeschylus said,”in war truth is the first causualty.” Even though this might be true it should not preclude us from making every attempt possible at showing others the truth. I believe in the truth as much as I believe it is capable to be objective. Anyone who says that an “objective journalist is a myth,” is a liar with an agenda. Do we all have biases? You bet. It is in the recognition of said biases and overcoming them is how the truth emerges.\nThat said, the best, most balanced site concerning operational, strategic and tactical reporting on the Russo-Ukrainian Warcan be found at the Austrian Military Academy.\nThese two are the most recent, here and the Ukrainian Purgatory, here. Both are in flawless, if somewhat accented, English.\nPerhaps we can claw back a bit of truth from the great Greek dramatists hell.",
