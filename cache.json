It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

Come join.\nThe goal?\nThe goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To \"bear the boredness\". (I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!",

It's hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.\nIt's living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator.

Yet, there's beauty in it too:\nI'm not alone.\nIt becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.\nWe're not alone.\nBlogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community.

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world.
