          "description": "I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.\nOne guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.\nWriting forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.\nOf course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).\nOne annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.\nOn the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.\nWhile I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)\nP.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?",

          "description": "\"But I don't know what to blog about.\"\nI often hear that. Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don't know what to write about. My answer is always the same:\n\"Blog your way to the answer.\"\nWe can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.\nBlog, blog, blog – that's the solution.\nWe might come to realize that we don't need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.\nOr maybe we'll realize that blogging isn't our thing at all. Then at least we've tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn't waste our time ruminating about it.\nThe only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It's still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.\nMany of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I'm really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog's small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.\nWho knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don't have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:\nThrough blogging.

Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I'll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I'll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I've really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don't always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.\nWhen I post something in the morning, I'll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don't have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it's a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I've also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me.

She was just about to meditate first.\nI've meditated myself in periods. I'm actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.\nFew things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I've tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.\nAm I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the \"technique\" isn't so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.\nIf meditation becomes something that \"should be done\" - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task 'meditation' on the to-do list.\nI leave you with that to meditate on.",

No more sleepless nights worrying about your post's popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.\nIn your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:\n/* Unlikely button */\n.upvote-button svg,\n.upvote-count {\n  display: none; \n}\nbutton.upvote-button { \n  display: block !important;\n  padding: 4px 9px;\n  font-family: var(--font-secondary);\n  font-size: 13px;\n  color: var(--link-color);\n  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);\n  border-radius: 6px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n.upvote-button::before {\n  content: \"☆ \";\n}\n.upvote-button::after {\n  content: \"Like it?\";\n}\n.upvote-button[disabled]::before {\n  content: \"★ \";\n}\n.upvote-button[disabled]::after {\n  content: \"Thank you!\";\n  cursor: default;\n}\n.upvote-button.upvoted {\n  color: var(--link-color) !important;\n  background-color: var(--accent-color);\n}\n.upvote-button:hover {\n  background-color: var(--accent-color);\n}\n\nSee the add-ons page for more Bear customizations.\nUpdate: If you're not using the Bearming Theme or simply want a lighter version, ReedyBear has you covered. Thanks for the highlighting tip!",

          "description": "So, it's been a while. Where do I start?\nLet’s start at the beginning.\nI’ve been writing for most of my life. As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way. Most of the time I was glad it was over, because I could finally stop the forced writing.\nI also wrote for a fairly big gaming website for a couple of years, but I always dreaded writing long reviews. Enjoyment was far away.\nThen, in June of this year, I rediscovered my love for writing — this time, on my personal blog. I found a community of fellow writers on Mastodon and r…",

I have vivid memories of two things in that house.\nThe first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.\n \n\nThe second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.\n \n\nWhen I was 11, my mother …",

There were times I found having one to be advantageous, but these days it's just plain annoying.\nThe house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I'm assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.\nWhen I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA.

While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf.
