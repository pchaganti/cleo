It seems to be in the bloodstream, so to speak (as in the endless streams, even rivers, of blood eternally being spilled). And in a sense, war, the urge to take someone else’s territory or simply kill endless numbers of… well, us… has certainly been in that very same bloodstream at least since the first great literary work of the Western world, The Iliad, was written. In some sense, you could say that, 3,000 years later, we’re all still in Troy. More\nThe post The Enemy is Us appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him.

This week I've replaced my usual routine of exercise and healthy eating with junk food binges and late bedtimes. Instead of reading and writing before bed I play videogames. I don't so much consciously decide to do this as much as I fall into it without meaning to: I think my brain knows that th…",

          "description": "I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn't know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn't that easy.\nAfter he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn't really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…",

          "description": "I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.\nHe replies:\nYes, it is. I can panic if I'm not allowed to write.\nI think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.\nIf I don't write in one form or another, it's like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn't matter. Just get it out of the system.\nI think it was Stephen King who said something like:\n\"If you don't have time to read, how will you have time to write?”\nFor me, it's the other way around. If I don't write, there's no way I can be fully present and absorb what I'm reading.\nWriting is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.",

I published the first post, It's alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\nAfter about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I'm not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.\nI tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:\nBear\nPika\nScribbles\nThey are all fantastic! If you're on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!\nFor me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.\nWhen I say \"forever,\" I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it's a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I'm very happy to have found my way back.\nI look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other \"Bears\" publish in this beautiful community.\nHappy blogging!",

Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.\nI've also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...\nWhile I'm deciding, please enjoy the croissant button.
