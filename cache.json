If Brazil puts tariffs on US goods, then the US will increase its tariffs by the same amount.\nHere’s the thing, Brazil and the US have essentially even trade:\n\n(light blue is exports, dark blue is imports)\nThe most recent services data I can find indicates that the US has a services surplus.\nBut more to the point, Trump wants to interfere in Brazil’s internal politics in a way that no Brazilian patriot could countenance.

Every room had cameras, and everyone who partook can be blackmailed.\nObservation: The great temptation with the Epstein files isn’t to release them or destroy them, the great temptation is to use them, because they represent a vast amount of power.\nAnyway, British and American elites have a predilection for under-age sex and various sexual pecadillos. A taste for being spanked and buggery, in particular, are endemic in the English ruling class due to what goes on in a lot of boys boarding schools. This is so much the case that enjoying being beaten used to be called “the English vice”. We pretend it was just a Victorian thing, but it continues.\nBeing part of the ruling class traditionally comes with the ability to ignore conventional mores, but members of that class didn’t (and still don’t seem to) fully understand what the changes is surveillance technology mean. Every time some idiot is outed because they filmed their own sexual perversions I laugh, but, simply put, if one must be depraved, keep it in house, don’t film it, you moron, and don’t trust anyone. (This isn’t exactly advice, but a powerful person being blackmailed is even worse than a powerful person with a private vice.)\nTrump’s has so far been able to push his program thru, but his approval ratings are underwater and important goals, like the end of birthright citizens immunity to revocation of citizenship are still to come. Trump needs leverage. I suspect he’s decided to use the leverage on hand.\nIf you’ve read this far, and you read a lot of this site’s articles, you might wish to Subscribe or donate.
