But if we ran pieces online, who would pay to receive our newsletter? We remained stubbornly committed to print and our 5,000 or so subscribers.

Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn't look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not.\nThe other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics.

They invariably suck.\nYes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).\nYes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).\nYes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.\n---\nThe only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.\nIf you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)",

If they can't do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.\nAgreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart's law. [0]\nIn the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.\nConsequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won't use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They'll only use those dashboards.\nWhich then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.\nHelping a colleague doesn't show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn't on the sprint board? Fuck that.\nWhich is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.\nAnd then, because this is the work reality you've created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you're left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.\n[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law",

          "description": "There's a decent amount of cynicism in the comments, which I understand. I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.\nHistorically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).\nThe last couple of decades we've seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).\nThis mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.\nThe method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.\nThe whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.",

At big companies, we'd usually do a lot of planning with diagrams, documentation, etc before building anything. I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when it comes to building a new products. Seeing how you've built some nice tools like Bear Blog, I wanted to hear from you personally.\nI've built a lot of things over the past 10 years. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, with a few of them becoming actual products that fund the rest of my tinkering.\nMy approach to building products is more akin to a gardener than to a product developer.

The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.\nEven as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.\nAmerica was the place to be. We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.\nToday, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.\nI am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).\nI went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.\nA lot will change over these next 4 years.\nBe kind to your loved ones today.\nMany of us need it.\n80/100\nComments\n\nProbably best to not have comments at this time.\nReply by email",

I write about whatever random things come to mind.\nI programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.\nI also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.\nOn rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.\nBeyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.\nAfter a year, Bear still feels like a great fit.

Blogging about it would have been completely unthinkable.\nOn the outside, everything looked peaceful and happy. No problems here! But deep down, I felt terrible.\nWhen I finally realized the seriousness of it and sought help, a whole new world opened up for me. I realized that I was far from alone in feeling this way. Suddenly, it no longer felt wrong or shameful, but human and understandable.\nNowadays, I'm open about both my past and during periods when I'm feeling down. I feel like it helps me, and actually others too. It creates a comforting sense of belonging and a realization that we humans are quite similar after all.\nWe're only human...\nIt's liberating to talk or write about it, it's valuable for our fellow human beings, and we can get strengthening and motivating support. A wonderful example of this is the lovely comments I received in the guestbook and on Mastodon after yesterday's post, Daunting Doubts. Thank you everyone!\nI'm not saying everything is appropriate to share. I'm also not saying that you should force yourself to be open. But sharing that human \"ugly and embarrassing\" stuff we try to hide, I think that's very healthy and valuable.\nSo next time you feel lost, share your shit!",

Soundtracks are nowhere to be found. Game music is a huge part of Bandcamp's presence, and game soundtracks have always felt like an embarrassing little side-effect of Bandcamp's popularity.

I talk about it fairly often.\nI didn't get diagnosed until somewhat recently, because, as is the story for a lot of women with ADHD, my symptoms as a little girl were different than the ones that were typically recognized, AKA the ones that young boys tend to exhibit more often. I was incredibly messy: my desks, lockers, backpacks, and bedroom tended to be absolute chaos. I lost things like homework and winter gloves a lot. I was constantly spacing out and daydreaming. I was generally kind of weird and bad at conversations.\nBut I wasn't disruptive or hyperactive, and I got good grades despite my problems with remembering to do homework, so my symptoms weren't seen as symptoms.
