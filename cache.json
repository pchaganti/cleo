Leading the group, and key to the international coalition, is 77-year-old retired U.S. Army colonel and State Department diplomat Ann Wright. After quitting the State Department in protest over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Wright has put her diplomatic skills to good use in helping to pull together a motley group of internationals. Her co-organizer from the U.S. is Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American attorney who is a co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement and who ran for congress in 2022. Arraf was key to organizing the very first flotillas that started in 2008. So far, there have been about 15 attempts to get to Gaza by boat, only five of them successful.

Image by Ray Acheson.\nAUKUS is the awkward-sounding acronym for “Australia-United Kingdom-United States”—a trilateral military alliance that stands poised to waste billions of dollars, proliferate high-level radioactive material and impose its safekeeping on First Nations communities for hundreds of thousands of years, increase global militarism and potentially provoke a nuclear war. If this doesn’t sound like a good investment to you, you’re not wrong. The deeper one digs into the details of this deal, the more one becomes flummoxed by cascading levels of absurdity. It is strikingly disadvantageous for Australia, yet other countries including Canada, Japan, and New Zealand/Aotearoa, have expressed interest in collaborating. Australian activists have been mobilizing to stop AUKUS for several years; it’s past time those living in other AUKUS states or those clamouring to partner with the alliance get informed and active, too.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Solidarity to Stop AUKUS appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Image by Erin Testone.\nThough Utah’s state government has failed to pull the Great Salt Lake from the verge of collapse, on March 20, 2024, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed a law that prohibits the state and local governments from granting legal personhood to animals, plants, or major ecosystems like the Great Salt Lake. The law is a reaction to a growing rights of nature movement in Utah seeking to secure legal personhood for the Great Salt Lake. By passing this law, Utah joins Ohio and Florida in banning rights of nature as a response to popular, grassroots campaigns seeking to secure rights-based protections for the ecosystems all life depends on. Because rights of nature laws would disrupt corporate exploitation of the natural world, these legislative efforts to squash the rights of nature movement are entirely predictable and similar to historical efforts to squash other rights-based movements like the civil rights and women’s suffrage movements. Instead of giving up in the face of setbacks like these, rights of nature advocates must learn how to enforce rights of nature outside of courtrooms and the legislative process along with adapting tactics and strategies for the long game of transforming the legal system into one with a rights of nature framing.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post The Great Salt Lake is Disappearing… So Utah Bans Rights of Nature. appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. \nThe CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.",

While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.",

Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.",

This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.",

          "description": "As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

In addition, while overall deposit funding has remained stable, we find that the banks most affected by the March 2023 events are offering higher deposit rates and are growing their deposit funding relative to the broader banking industry.",

          "description": "While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

          "description": "Hi all, we recently open sourced the first version of Hashquery, a Python library which lets you model analytics, DRY up common logic, and execute it against a database or warehouse.\nWe were originally rendering SQL directly for all our queries, but that spiraled out of control with more complex analysis; the SQL needed to be changed sporadically for each new database dialect (BigQuery, Redshift, Aethena, Postgres, etc etc) and the SQL fragments were very challenging to reuse (and so fragments were copy-pasted all over).\n~~~\nAdvantages we think it has over writing SQL by hand:\n- Queries are fully compossible, so any analysis can be chained into further analysis without refactoring.\n- All analysis executes within the data warehouse itself, making them super fast for big data.\n- It's just Python, so you can extend or parameterize query logic with a simple def function.\n- You can run it anywhere, like inside of unit tests, ETL nodes, or Jupyter notebooks.\n- Developer experience is pretty good since editors already know how to autocomplete Python. ChatGPT knows Python already too :)\n- The library handles normalizing between database dialects. Write once and use in any database.\n- Hashquery content is fully serializable, which makes it a good fit for exposing a flexible API for consumers to efficiently query datamarts or internal analytics. We use it as the endpoint for headless BI, as opposed to having to define and teach a DSL or GraphQL specification.\n~~~\nWe've built native funnel analysis on top of Hashquery and have been thrilled with it so far, and we thought others might want to use it too. It's pretty early days so we're still trying to explain it, and the docs aren't perfectly clear, but the examples on the dev site are editable and you can download the pip package to play around with it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40132424\nPoints: 22\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I drifted into the Conway's Life research community in 2001 when I won a small cash prize for a lucky discovery of something called a \"boojum reflector\". My involvement has gradually snowballed since then. Off and on I've helped maintain various Life-related mailing lists and blogs, the Life Lexicon, and more recently the conwaylife.com forums and LifeWiki.\nAnother thing I stumbled into was helping Nathaniel Johnson complete an improbably thorough 480-page Conway's Life textbook, with end-of-chapter exercises and everything.  The book could be used to teach a college-level class on the subject. https://conwaylife.com/book/ has a free PDF download for the book.\nSo... I'm not the cleverest Lifenthusiast by a long shot, but for a random question about the Game of Life, I'm more likely to know something about it than at least 99.9999% of the world's population.

Authors now have their own followings on social media and can reach them directly.\nYou give cash advances? Fans on Kickstarter give 10x more.\nWhat's sad though is that publishers have historically had one power that would have been unassailable – editorial judgement. They could have sustained their brands on quality. Imagine a world where you wanted something good to read, and among all the garbage out there saw a title and went \"this one is by Simon & Schuster, it has to be good\".

Quest 3 makes modding even harder. This announcement is trying to frame App Lab as an open app distribution platform; it isn't. Those \"basic technical and content requirements\" apps have to meet are basically the same ones that Apple or Google or Meta themselves enforce for their app stores. Entire classes of applications, particularly those that undermine platform-owners' business models are not allowed.\nAdditionally, Horizon is generally a terrible operating system. Useless and intrusive \"social\" features out the wazoo, laden with tracking/spyware, and it isn't even good for anything beyond launching apps that take over the whole environment. Want to use your fancy headset to open up apps in 3d space and do some multitaking work? Well I sure hope you're happy with exactly 3 2d apps (all equally sized) lined up in a row in a fixed location, because that's all you're getting. If you want to do anything real you need to install an app that launches its own environment for multitasking, but of course then you can only pull in windows from a remote PC, so if you want to run any local applications it's back to basics for you. Oh, and of course you can't mix those remote PC windows with local apps. As poor as Apple's Vision OS is in the multitasking department Horizon falls far behind even it.",

Whether this overwork is real or imaginary is immaterial; but we should observe, in passing, that A’s sensation (or illusion) might easily result from his own decreasing energy—a normal symptom of middle-age. For this real or imagined overwork there are, broadly speaking, three possible remedies\n(1) He may resign.\n(2) He may ask to halve the work with a colleague called B.\n(3) He may demand the assistance of two subordinates, to be called C and D.\nThere is probably no instance in civil service history of A choosing any but the third alternative. By resignation he would lose his pension rights. By having B appointed, on his own level in the hierarchy, he would merely bring in a rival for promotion to W’s vacancy when W (at long last) retires. So A would rather have C and D, junior men, below him. They will add to his consequence; and, by dividing the work into two categories, as between C and D, he will have the merit of being the only man who comprehends them both.\"",

The upside is incredibly simple and consistent language grammar, while making it trivial to create new flow control mechanisms since the language has all the tools baked in (primarily first class blocks).",

Reading the whole article it seems that Bayer is moving to a system better known as QBR, mixed with OKRs and most likely some sort of agile model.\nThere is no no-hierarchies. Working in a 3 month cadence on an organizational level puts a lot of pressure on all people. Usually QBRs work top down and there is more monitoring along the process.\nWhat sounds great is more or less success theatre as well as inflexibility. No one wants to lack behind in a QBR report. Risking 4 times a year being red flagged in a report sparks fear.\nAlso approval processes and idea sharing are the first victims of such reorganizations. No one risks a 2 week sprint for some improvement sprint or working on technical debt in tech for example.\nI’ve seen this within a company with 100k employees worldwide.\nPeople will regret QBRs.\nUsually companies want to get rid of the costs of middle managers, which are usually elder than normal staffers. Also companies want to include younger folks, because they are on average cheaper per resource from a controlling perspective.\nYoung guns without leadership with delivery pressure by an even older senior management layer means having a large gap and divide between them.\nSenior management adds so called assistants to their staff, the hidden layer.\nI watched a lot of mobbing at the lower level as a result. Fear of tumbling over mistakes aka receiving a bad performance review is rampant when you need to report all the time results.\nMixing teams every QBR sounds fun, but isn’t. It means even more being in constant competition. Who is the most flexible employee and most successful under different circumstances?\nLarge organizations are hard to manage. People will very soon miss their middle managers to cover things up in a human way.\nQBRs don’t help if there is a clear product strategy missing.\nThere is no perfect system, but QBRs are some of the most toxic form of working and collaboration that I have witnessed so far.",

There are a lot of factors that determine how receptive we are to learning something - current interests, life experience, how developed our brains are, etc - beyond just the way it is taught.

As a result, the principal (for example an owner) has to come up with methods to keep their management honest (example... tying most compensation to stock price - although I think this just makes management short sighted).\nI was once in a meeting where an IT manager was told his group would have to handle the install for a piece of software that like 2 engineers used. The guy asked for 3 additional head count and my jaw dropped. If someone has ever seen the Avatar Airbender show, I was like Prince Zuko speaking up at his father's meeting. You see I was there as a courtesy and tried to point out that even one headcount seemed like a lot for something that should take less than a week of work for a single employee. At the time I didn't understand that the manager understood this, but was playing for more staff to build their own importance. I didn't understand the games they play. As part of the game...you always say your people are swamped no matter what...or refer to a massive backlog of work even though that backlog is all super low priority and existing employees can be reprioritized.",

I just want to comment on this quote from the article:\n\"Really good developers do 90% or more of the work before they ever touch the  keyboard;\"\nWhile that may be true sometimes, I think that ignores the fact that most people can't keep a whole lot of constraints and concepts in their head at the same time. So the amount of pure thinking you can do without writing anything at all is extremely limited.\nMy solution to this problem is to actually hit the keyboard almost immediately once I have one or more possible ways to go about a problem, without first fully developing them into a well specified design. And then, I try as many of those as I think necessary, by actually writing the code. With experience, I've found that many times, what I initially thought would be the best solution turned out to be much worse than what was initially a less promising one. Nothing makes problems more apparent than concrete, running code.\nIn other words, I think that rather than just thinking, you need to put your ideas to the test by actually materializing them into code. And only then you can truly appreciate all consequences your ideas have on the final code.\nThis is not an original idea, of course, I think it's just another way of describing the idea of software prototyping, or the idea that you should \"throw away\" your first iteration.\nIn yet different words: writing code should be actually seen as part of the \"thinking process\".",

          "description": "> Stewart Butterfield, former CEO of Slack, recently described a dynamic within tech companies behind much of the over-hiring. He noted on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast in late May that when there’s no real constraint on hiring, “you hire someone, and the first thing that person wants to do is hire other people.” The reason is that “the more people who report to you, the higher your prestige, the more your power in the organization…So every budgeting process is, ‘I really want to hire,’ and that to me is the root of all the excess.”\nI’ve seen this first hand. One place where I worked HR even had a table of team size vs manager compensation. When I pointed out that it may not be the best idea to directly incentivize managers to hire more people they were less than understanding. Of course it went totally out of control.\nBut sadly there just is no counteracting force (except perhaps mr Musk). When you apply for your next job as a manager they will ask you “How big was your team?”, and they won’t be impressed when you say “I managed to keep it down to four people”. It’s just something that resonates very strongly with the primitive side of our brains (“You say you were the chief, how big was your tribe?”).",

          "description": "Disagree with most points. This seems like another \"hyper-productivity\" driven blog post that is so common nowadays. If you don't grind 10h and have a clear career path, you are a failure. Couldn't disagree more.\n- Have good sleep habits. Sleeping 4-6 hours per day because of \"productivity\" is not cool.\n- Don't be obsessed with \"productivity\" and \"efficiency\". It's okay to take days off and relax.\n- Which leads to... Prioritize your mental and body health.\n- Career path? Big aspirations? Nothing in life is promised except death; don't forget to enjoy every day. Build habits that you truly enjoy doing every day.\n- Take care of your family and friends. Don't see people as a \"network\" to use for your own benefit. Love and be loved as a genuine human.\n- Absolutely do write blogs and do some public speaking because you enjoy it, but not to clickbait people into buying your motivational courses.\nIn summary, find balance and true happiness for yourself. This post was sad to read.",

          "description": "I work in academia. When we grade exams, the order of the exams on the stack is the order in which they were collected in the room (people can sit wherever they like). For grading, we are usually 5 people in a single room, and everyone grades a specific exercise for consistency. The exams are getting shuffled heavily, with everyone just grabbing stacks, looking for exams where \"their\" exercise was not yet graded, and taking them out. So basically, the order in which we grade exams can be considered random.\nHowever, I also grade weekly exercise sheets during the semester, and these are committed into a repository, where each student has a folder that... begins with the first letter of their first name. Everyone I have ever worked with acknowledges that you have to shuffle the order in which you grade these submissions each week, for fairness. Several effects come into play: (1) your are usually less tired at the beginning, (2) your mood gets better during the last 2 sheets because you know you are done soon, (3, and crucially) at the beginning, you have not yet seen all the common errors / developed a \"feeling\" for them, and you might thus miss them in early submissions, but spot them immediately in later submissions.\nAnother alphabetic effect: In elementary school, my name was on top of the list of students in my class. I remember that I often had to do some special job simply because I was the first name on this list (for example, carry a group ticket when we visited some museum, keep track of something, be the first at something where nobody wanted to be the first, with everyone watching, be the first to be graded in PE, again with everyone watching, etc.). As a fairly shy kid, this already annoyed me in first grade.",
