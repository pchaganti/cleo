          "description": "I think it’s clear that democracy and capitalism don’t work together. Capitalists always wind up buying the government, and the only solution is a Great Depression sized catastrophe to reset the wealth of capitalists. But then, over time, they will capture the government again.\nThis isn’t to say much good may not be done at various times. Usually after things get bad enough, a generation winds up in power who is determined to make government work “for the people” because they’ve seen what happens when it doesn’t. War, revolution, poverty, depression and so on. The second generation staggers on. They don’t really understand in their bones that government must be made to work for the people, and they compromise, but they keep it more or less going. Then the third generation says “hey, if we …",

Open source, and open standards. Everyone outside North America and maybe Europe is going to prefer that and those who set the standards control the tech. On top of that, American AI is frighteningly expensive: no one in the US is making any money. Every query costs more to produce than is earned, even from customers who are paying, let alone all the free accounts.\nDeepseek is much less expensive per query, however. The idea of capitalism is to, y’know, make money? There’s a limit to how much money Softbank can throw at AI if it doesn’t start providing at least some returns.\nFurther, American style AI requires massive amounts of energy. And guess…",

I used to call America “the consumer of last resort.” If you wanted to get rich, if you wanted to industrialize, if you wanted to scale, you needed the American market. Europe sold to America, Japan sold to America, South Korea sold to America and China sold to America. This requirement is why Japan was forced to sign the Plaza Accords, which basically destroyed their future. Oh, life in Japan is fine now, but it’s no longer the roaring Tiger of the 80s.\nBut America has lost its place, which is why China was able to laugh in its face when Trump tried to use tariffs against it. His assumption was that China needed the American market. True 20 years ago. Maybe true 10 years ago. Not true now.\n\nBut wait… there’s more!\n\nNot so pretty, is…",
