According to the New York Times, internal polling showed that still undecided voters were \"six times as likely as other battleground-state voters to be motivated by their views of Israel’s war in Gaza.\" Either the Harris campaign missed this lurking demographic or, more likely, just didn't care. Of course, Trump's still going to give Netanyahu the greenlight to burn Gaza, the West Bank and southern Lebanon to the ground and then target Iran.

Eclipse had QNX as a target. GCC and most of the Gnu command line tools could be built for QNX.\nThere was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.\nAll of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.\nThen, in 2007, QNX went open source. You could even look at the microkernel. It wasn't openly licensed, but you could look inside and build it.\nIn 2010, RIM acquired QNX, and, with no warning, closed the source.

Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn't look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not.\nThe other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics.

They invariably suck.\nYes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).\nYes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).\nYes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.\n---\nThe only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.\nIf you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)",

          "description": "There's a decent amount of cynicism in the comments, which I understand. I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.\nHistorically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).\nThe last couple of decades we've seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).\nThis mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.\nThe method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.\nThe whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.",

Still slightly grey on upper and lower lip and continuing laser. I started Progesterone on month five instead of month six--and I shouldn't have. I was simply hurting too much and trying to rush the process. Cyproterone as T-blocker and patches for Estrogen. I'm not giving the amounts here because that's not what's important--it's your blood level concentration for T and E that you should be looking at.\nThinking I would at least like to be one cup bigger in breast growth!\nEveryone tells me to imagine where I'll be in three years time and in all honesty, I don't even know where I'll be next year. I try not to think too far ahead now and just stay in the moment. :)\nEw-phoria moment: got checked out by a group of four men in a very uncomfortable way that made me run off. No thank you.\nWeird moments: suddenly being asked out in the past two weeks and having crushes admitted to me by a few friends and I had to quickly and politely--but firmly--turn them down.

The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.\nEven as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.\nAmerica was the place to be. We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.\nToday, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.\nI am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).\nI went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.\nA lot will change over these next 4 years.\nBe kind to your loved ones today.\nMany of us need it.\n80/100\nComments and 💬 Community Echoes\n\nNo comments available but here are some 💬 Community Echoes\nRe: Various election posts by reedybear\nCommunity Commiseration by Kevin Humdrum\nReply by email",

But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.\nI also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.\nOn rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.\nBeyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.\nAfter a year, Bear still feels like a great fit.

Suddenly, it no longer felt wrong or shameful, but human and understandable.\nNowadays, I'm open about both my past and during periods when I'm feeling down. I feel like it helps me, and actually others too. It creates a comforting sense of belonging and a realization that we humans are quite similar after all.\nWe're only human...\nIt's liberating to talk or write about it, it's valuable for our fellow human beings, and we can get strengthening and motivating support. A wonderful example of this is the lovely comments I received in the guestbook and on Mastodon after yesterday's post, Daunting Doubts. Thank you everyone!\nI'm not saying everything is appropriate to share. I'm also not saying that you should force yourself to be open. But sharing that human \"ugly and embarrassing\" stuff we try to hide, I think that's very healthy and valuable.\nSo next time you feel lost, share your shit!",

Let's go.\nYep, go to college\nAll the people out there making noise about how college isn't for everyone and that becoming a plumber or joining the army are good solid alternatives, you know the ones I'm talking about, those people are anti-education conservatives who went to college themselves and who plan on sending their children.

I was incredibly messy: my desks, lockers, backpacks, and bedroom tended to be absolute chaos. I lost things like homework and winter gloves a lot. I was constantly spacing out and daydreaming. I was generally kind of weird and bad at conversations.\nBut I wasn't disruptive or hyperactive, and I got good grades despite my problems with remembering to do homework, so my symptoms weren't seen as symptoms.
