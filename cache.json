I haven't properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there's more to it.\nI thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…",

The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.\nAs I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.\nThis feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.\nI wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I'm so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep.

To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.\nI don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.\nI overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase\nI write code because its fun. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.\nI love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.\nI rely a lot on intuition.\nI’m not a fan of TDD.\nI value data structures over algorithms.\nI don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.\nI prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.\nI'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math\nThat's it for now :)",

It makes it more interesting.\nHowever, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It's a balancing act.\nIntroducing Komments.cloud\nFull disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.\n\n\n\nKomments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let's call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.\nHow does it work?  Simple:\nWrite your blog post as normal in Bear\nCreate an page in Komments.cloud for user comments\nAdd a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments\nDone\nIf anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.\nThere's more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.\nWorks everywhere\nYou can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.\nBear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.\nVideo\nHere's a two minute video on how to add commenting to a Bear blog post.\nGive it a go\nFancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?\nOh, and it's completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.\nI'm happy to help, if you are not sure how to set it up.  Email david@komments.cloud\nComments welcome",

I can’t remember the sound of your voice, the shape of your face or the feel of your hand. I vaguely remember admiring the energy and intelligence in someone so young, but I regret that you didn’t leave a lasting mark, you didn’t become my guide in my journey through hell. \n I wouldn’t even remember your name if you hadn’t written me twelve years ago. My wife Mirna memorized the name and address on the envelope because she attributed a strange power to your letter. Unfortunately I never saw that…",
