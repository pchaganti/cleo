          "description": "In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.",

I don't blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.\nThe only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly \"Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?\"\nI do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it's been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don't participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these \"professional\" creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.",

          "description": "Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax\nWe're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).\nProblem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of \"de-NVIDIAfying\" that needs to be done.\nSolution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.\nOur strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!",

If we don’t build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people.\nTranslation for the rest of us: \"we need to fully privatize the OA subsidiary and turn it into a B-corp which can raise a lot more capital over the next decade, in order to achieve the goals of the nonprofit, because the chief threat is not anything like existential risk from autonomous agents in the next few years or arms races, but inadequate commercialization due to fundraising constraints\".",

The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it's a major source of content for the Wayback machine.\nIn fact, that's the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone's site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).\nThere are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don't, and that applied whether they are bots or people.",

This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time.

          "description": "Hey,\nHow long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.\nHonestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.\nHave you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …",

          "description": "I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.\nI don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.\nI have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.\nthis isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.\nI don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?\nbut it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.\ndo what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.\non my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️\nreply via email",

          "description": "\"I could be wrong; I've been wrong once before.\"\nA former coworker of mine used to say this. Of course, he said it as a joke, but it's also a classic example of 'it's funny because it's true'.\nNo one would seriously express themselves this way, but it seems to be the attitude many people harbor. I was reminded of this when I read Manuel Moreale's great post, It should be easy to say \"My bad, I was wrong\". He writes:\nSaying \"I was wrong\" is a sign you're willing to get better and improve.\nSo true! Making mistakes and being wrong is part of life's learning curve, from the moment we take our first stumbling steps. We learn, develop, and move forward with newfound knowledge and wisdom.\nBut it's as if our delicate little egos, built on something as fragile as always being right, are afraid of perishing if they admit to being wrong. It's not only a fragile existence but also a very foolish attitude.\nOften, when we make mistakes, it's partly because someone else taught us wrong from the beginning. So, it's not just our own ego we're trying to protect but others as well. An impossible mission where the only thing that will self-destruct is ourselves.\nAdmitting that we were wrong is not only the right thing to do. It's also significantly easier than fighting for the right to \"be right.\"\nLet's all do the right thing when we're wrong by simply saying:\nSorry, I was wrong.\nmail Email\n print Print\n share Share",

The problem is the amount I consume.\nMost of what I listen to falls under the productivity/self-improvement category, things you'd classify as \"good content.\" And in moderation, it can be helpful. Who doesn’t want to improve their life?\nBut I suck at moderation. I listen to back-to-back episodes, not giving myself time to process what I've heard. Hours of opinions and advice that rarely result in meaningful life change.\nThe constant audio stream prevents me from letting my mind wander. My thoughts are crowded out, and my attention is divided, making it difficult to fully engage with the present moment.\nThis weekend, I put my headphones away. I wanted to see how I felt without the distraction.\nAt first, it was uncomfortable because I have a habit of always listening to something. But after a few days, I appreciated times of silence. I felt more relaxed.\nFrom now on, I want to be more intentional about how much content I consume. I could limit myself to one episode of a podcast or one chapter of an audiobook.\nMore doesn't necessarily mean better.

Not just for blog posts.\nIf I’ve ever left you on Read1, it's (mostly) not because I am ignoring you. Most of the time, I respond in my head, exit out of the message, and completely forget about it. This can happen for text or email.\nIt's not you, it's me.\nSometimes, I just get really overwhelmed and may take me some time to respond. Again, it's me, not you.\nAnyways, back to the blog posts.\nI've been reading a ton of blog posts that I've wanted to reply to. Or mostly to spin off my own Reply post to it. I think I've only done one response post because I keep forgetting to physically write it down on my to-do list to start.\nEssentially this is just a reminder to myself that I'd still like to do that. And to stop forgetting.\nThat's all.

This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…",

It is much, much more than that. \n By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” \n I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things.

Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside.

Such analyses also demonstrate why the CNT is passing through such a profound crisis: it is a trade union which is completely excluded from the world of work.
