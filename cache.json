Not surprisingly then, by 2018, 20 transmission lines had been canceled in California, mainly because so many homes were already producing solar power on their own rooftops, saving $2.6 billion in total consumer energy costs.

          "description": "Shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023, a consortium of eleven large U.S. financial institutions deposited $30 billion into First Republic Bank to bolster its liquidity and assuage panic among uninsured depositors. In the end, however, First Republic Bank did not survive, raising the question of whether a reallocation of liquidity among financial institutions can ever reduce the need for central bank balance sheet expansion in the fight against bank runs. We explore this question in this post, based on a recent working paper.",

This enhancement\nhelps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between\ndifferent phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.\nFor a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a\n.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of\nwhen the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume\nis updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.\nWhat changed?\nThe API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the\ncurrent timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will\nbe overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.\nFor more details, read about\nPhase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you're watching right now.\nAnother thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called \"SoundFixer\" that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it's super distracting), but it doesn't seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they're embedded. I don't know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It's probably too niche and hard to do though.\nAlso I don't seem to find any volume control except mute?",

The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs.\nCourts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics. If using such a tactic turned the claim from \"you killed this person negligently\" to \"you killed this person negligently, then willfully tried sleazy tricks to create additional suffering for the husband\", and had the potential to double the award, companies would be much less eager to play this game.",

The market does not have a concept of fairness, only competition.

It’s not expressive, what would be a one-liner in Python makes you write three for loops in Go. I constantly need to find workarounds for the lack of proper enums, lack of sum types, no null safety etc.\nI’m sure these are the exact reasons why Go is good for enterprise software, but for personal projects, I get no fun out of using it",

          "description": "People always under-estimate the cost of properly learning a language.  At any given time I tend to have a \"main go-to language\".  I typically spend 2-4 years getting to the point where I can say I \"know\" a language.  Then I try to stick to it long enough for the investment to pay off.  Usually 8-10 years.\nA surprising number of people think this is a very long time. It isn't.  This is typically the time it takes to understand enough of the language, the compiler, the runtime, the standard library, and idiomatic ways to do things.  It is the time it takes to where you can start to meaningfully contribute to evolving how the language is used and meaningfully coach architects, programmers and system designers. It is also what you need to absorb novices into the organization and train them fast.",

I worked for Google years ago but I was in the NYC office, so we didn't run into the YouTube folks much.\nOpinions about YouTube may be mixed here on HN, but it is objectively one of the most successful businesses in tech or media to emerge in the past 15 years. If it weren't buried inside Alphabet, Youtube would be worth on the order of $400 billion, more than Disney and Comcast combined. It's a weird mix of a huge creator monetization network, a music channel, an education platform, a forever-store of niche content, and a utility.\nIt's also not a business that rested on it's laurels. It's easy to forget how novel creator monetization was when YouTube adopted it. They do a lot of active work to manage their creators, and now have grown into a music and podcast platform that is challenging Apple. To top it off, YouTube TV, despite costing just as much as cable, is objectively a good product.\nFew products have the brand, the reach, monetization, and the endurance that YouTube has had within Google. And I know for a fact that this is in no small part due to the way it was managed.\nI've probably watched tens of thousands of hours of YouTube at this point. Some of it sublime, some of it absurd, some of it critical for my work or my degree. I couldn't imagine a world without it.\nRIP.",
