          "description": "Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.",

          "description": "The consumer price index for groceries has risen more than the overall price index since the start of the pandemic, with a particularly large jump in 2022. In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.",

          "description": "Some context: Students are protesting to reform the quota system. Which was abolished in 2018 after protest but recently brought back again. The Quota system basically reserves 56% of public sector jobs, i.e. 30% to relatives of war veteran.\nThe war happened in 1971. To get public job and avail the quota, it must be their 3rd or 4th generation now. Which is plain unfair.\nBut it’s not about that, the gov loyalists and their goons fake these veteran certificates to land these jobs. Bangladesh is one of the most corrupted countries in the world after all. So real veteran relatives are seldom the beneficiary.\nThese students just wanted to reform this system. But our fascist gov and their goons used force and killed 50+ unarmed students until yesterday (3 from my alma mater alone.) This was completely unprovoked and unnecessary. Basically any forms of dissent have been dealt with this way since 2009. No one can criticize or protest the big brother.\nWe have a dictatorship since 2009. People are angry - due to corruption, inflation, joblessness and tyranny. This is just some outburst of it.\nWhen you see the videos how the police are killing teenagers and university students in the road - our future generation - no one can tolerate this.\nNow the fascist gov has closed all internet and phone connection to outside world. I can't contact my family anymore. I don't know their well being.\nThere is of course more to it. But this is the summary.",

Our company does firmware updates to hundreds of thousands of devices every month and those updates always go through 3 rounds of internal testing, then to a couple dozen real world users who we have a close relationship with (and we supply them with spare hardware that is not on the early update path in case there is a problem with an early rollout). Then the update goes to a small subset of users who opt in to those updates, then they get rolled out in batches to the regular users in case we still somehow missed something along the way.

          "description": "Wow, this hits close to home. Doing a page fault where you can't in the kernel is exactly what I did with my very first patch I submitted after I joined the Microsoft BitLocker team in 2009. I added a check on the driver initialization path and didn't annotate the code as non-paged because frankly I didn't know at the time that the Windows kernel was paged. All my kernel development experience up to that point was with Linux, which isn't paged.\nBitLocker is a storage driver, so that code turned into a circular dependency. The attempt to page in the code resulted a call to that not-yet-paged-in code.\nThe reason I didn't catch it with local testing was because I never tried rebooting with BitLocker enabled on my dev box when I was working on that code. For everyone on the team that did have BitLocker enabled they got the BSOD when they rebooted. Even then the \"blast radius\" was only the BitLocker team with about 8 devs, since local changes were qualified at the team level before they were merged up the chain.\nThe controls in place not only protected Windows more generally, but they even protected the majority of the Windows development group. It blows my mind that a kernel driver with the level of proliferation in industry could make it out the door apparently without even the most basic level of qualification.",

The citizens of Florida overwhelmingly voted to restore voting rights to people who had completed their sentence. Ron DeSantis and the Republicans modified the law to prevent people from voting if they hadn't paid all of their fees, which there is no central tracking or source of.

          "description": "Crowdstrike did this to our production linux fleet back on April 19th, and I've been dying to rant about it.\nThe short version was: we're a civic tech lab, so we have a bunch of different production websites made at different times on different infrastructure. We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.\nWhen we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.\nCrowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- \"we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it\" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise. What they're selling to the enterprise is exactly that they'll do that.",

It's easy to blame CrowdStrike but that seems too easy on both the orgs that do this but also the upstream forces that compel them to do it.\nMy org which does mission critical healthcare just deployed ZScaler on every computer which is now in the critical path of every computer starting up and then in the critical path of every network connection the computer makes. The risk of ZScaler being a central point of failure is not considered. But - the risk of failing the compliance checkbox it satisfies is paramount.\nAll over the place I'm seeing checkbox compliance being prioritised above actual real risks from how the compliance is implemented. Orgs are doing this because they are more scared of failing an audit than they are of the consequences failure of the underlying systems the audits are supposed to be protecting. So we need to hold regulatory bodies accountable as well - when they frame regulation such that organisations are cornered into this they get to be part of the culpability here too.",

          "description": "Throwaway account...\nCrowdStrike in this context is a NT kernel loadable module (a .sys file) which does syscall level interception and logs then to a separate process on the machine. It can also STOP syscalls from working if they are trying to connect out to other nodes and accessing files they shouldn't be (using some drunk ass heuristics).\nWhat happened here was they pushed a new kernel driver out to every client without authorization to fix an issue with slowness and latency that was in the previous Falcon sensor product. They have a staging system which is supposed to give clients control over this but they pissed over everyone's staging and rules and just pushed this to production.\nThis has taken us out and we have 30 people currently doing recovery and DR. Most of our nodes are boot looping with blue screens which in the cloud is not something you can just hit F8 and remove the driver. We have to literally take each node down, attach the disk to a working node, delete the .sys file and bring it up. Either that or bring up a new node entirely from a snapshot.\nThis is fine but EC2 is rammed with people doing this now so it's taking forever. Storage latency is through the roof.\nI fought for months to keep this shit out of production because of this reason. I am now busy but vindicated.\nEdit: to all the people moaning about windows, we've had no problems with Windows. This is not a windows issue. This is a third party security vendor shitting in the kernel.",

Try to make use of your networks and friends as much as possible.\nAs for my situation, I too feel a bit burned by the diminishing number of tech jobs, as I was in the process of trying to get a job via a software consultancy firm, but remained benched for 8 months.

I'm a collector of nightstand-books.\n-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I'm in love.\n-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.\n-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you're shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you're wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it's like I'm afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.\n-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).\n-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don't know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.",

          "description": "Contrary to what the name may suggest, this is not a blog dedicated solely to my problems. As I make my debut into the realm of Bear — thrilled at the thought of reaching other bloggers through the ever-inspiring discovery feed — I must make one thing clear: I love a good rhyme. Sometimes more than logic. And in this case, the tradeoff for choosing a name that rhymes is that the content in my blog won’t always align with the title, and I’m okay with that.\nMy purpose here isn’t to please or to delight; it’s to express — something we rarely get the space to do authentically online. Being here takes a degree of vulnerability for me, but it comes with the gentle comfort of some anonymity.\nHere, I am still Emma as I am in everyday life, but I am also imperceptible behind the words you read. While I plan to share with an open heart and freely exhibit the more anomalous corners of my mind, I know that the stakes are lower than what they seem to be on other platforms, where it often feels like I'm being observed too closely, or slipping into an alter-ego that doesn't truly capture me. Here, it feels like I can say what I want to say without the recurring fear of being perceived or held to a fixed identity. And, no matter who happens to stumble upon the musings of these pages — no matter who thinks what of the words I write — I still intend to make this a space where I can comfortably express whatever may come to the surface of my being.\nAnd so, with a nod of thanks to you, the equally imperceptible reader, and also one to the creator of this charming platform — who happens to be the man I gladly spend my days with — so begins my emergence. Let’s see what this Bear blogness is all about.",

I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .\nMy half sleep state was gone.

Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.\nMy grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?\nI told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.\nI cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).\nI was successful in my first strike but he was alive.

I was drawn to the glitz and glamor of playing in cavernous concert halls to people in suits sitting on red velvet chairs. I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.\nFor a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around.
