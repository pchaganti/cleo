For a long time, Ukraine got everything it wanted, but since Oct 7th, it has been #2, or worse, on America’s priority list. Mossad has a great deal of influence in America, just short of control, almost certainly due to a sickening collection of videos and pictures, and Israel has received the first cut off everything it needed: most especially of interceptor missiles.\nEven so, the reason that Israel and the US called for a ceasefire and Iran did not (though it accepted one) is that Israel was less than a week from running out of air defense missiles, and as best I can tell, the US could only have supplied about another 7-10 days worth.\nWhat this means for Ukraine is simple enough, they’re being absolutely hammered by R…",

(My apologies on never completing the nuclear one, an extremely necessary but far too grim subject for my taste.) In that series of essays I made a few assertions I want to bring to your attention again in a more contemporary context. First, that the result of wars tend to confirm strengths of the coalition arrayed against the main combatants before the war even started. This is, in fact, not an assertion, but an iron law of warfare that still exists in chimpanzee warfare. See Strategy: a history, chapter one, by Freedman if you disagree.\n \nSecond, that big global dustups tend to run in about 100 year cycles these days.\nSo, take a look around–got a big hot war in the Ukraine slightly analogous to the Sino-Japanese war of the 1930s. Next, you got weird, unresolved shenanigans in the Middle East that have a weird reverse-appeasement type feal.\nWe’re quite possible looking at the two opening battles of WWIII, right now.",

While the hospital sustained shockwave damage from nearby blasts, it was not directly hit, Iranian reports emphasize. \n\nSororka is the primary hospital for military casualties, I understand, but it wasn’t targeted.
