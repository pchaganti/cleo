Trade agreements like NAFTA, intended promote economic growth, have inadvertently fueled drug-trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border, contributing to a crisis of violence that disproportionately impacts marginalized communities—those already vulnerable due to poverty and limited political power.

His quest for a meaningful life led Vance to be baptized a Catholic in 2019. The sentiments he so eloquently endorsed in 2020 suggested that in politics he would act as a Pope Francis progressive—the very opposite of a sophist acolyte for Donald J. Trump. Instead, we now see a vice-presidential candidate who lives by what Peter Quinn calls the “Wanton Opportunism” of a “Horatio Hillbilly,” Commonweal, September 8).  Equally problematic, Vance is paired with a presidential candidate who, as Alexander Motyl points out (here, October 20) stops at nothing to boost his own power.

I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take.\"  Then you'll get asked to \"ballpark it\" because that's what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done \"ahead of time\" and look good.\nNow, I've had good managers who totally didn't need this strategy, and I loved 'em to death.

You'll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)\n- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]\n- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.\n- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.\nThis isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.\n- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn't ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.\n- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.\n- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.\n[1]: https://x.com/lcasdev/status/1810696257137959018",

If you cant decompose to avoid \"wonky parameters\" then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.\nIME \"heavy\" function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.",

They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.\n2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.\nSo that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”",

Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.\nA more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.\nBeing able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?\nAgree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.\nThe tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely.

I've tried to start this book many times before, but I always stopped in the first chapter or so because I felt that the author was being unnecessarily airy and, more importantly, he directly claimed that he ended up in this semi enlightened state but doesn't rightly know how he got there. This point was the point where I always stopped, but this time I decided to power through it, and in doing so I discovered I've been missing an important part: after not knowing what had happened, and just living in a state of present bliss, Eckhart discovered that what had happened to him is what many religions aim as their ultimate goal, so he went on to discover more about that and how a normal person might get to his state, but told from hi…",

          "description": "I feel like the peak internet for me was some time around 2004. The internet felt balanced, and I was happy with my relationship with it. Sure, I probably spent more time than I should have on the internet, but at least I wasn't carrying it around with me. I wasn't surfing the web on my bathroom breaks or while standing in line at the grocery store. The internet was a tool, not a conqueror of my attention.\nFor years, I've talked about wanting to set up a desktop or a designated computer space. Some place where I have go and sit down in order to log on. A place where I'll keep my computer off and give myself a few seconds to decide whether looking up an actress in some random sitcom episode is truly worth the effort. I want to add a little friction to my computing and just see how my mental health responds. Will I feel better? Will my attention improve? These are the questions I'm curious about.\nBeing that I have a little free time on my hands, I thought now is as good of a time as ever to give this a shot. So, starting tonight at midnight, I'm disconnecting. For the next week, my MacBook will live on my dining room table. I'm uninstalling most of the apps that I use on my phone to make it as bare-bones as possible. My iPad will remain on, but with the Wi-Fi turned off. I have a lot of magazines downloaded courtesy of Archive.org and some books I plan to read with my free time.\nI wonder how my browsing habits will change if I don't have a piece of technology at my fingertips. Will I feel compelled to keep up with as much, or will I just find other mindless activities to fill my time? Heck, I even wonder if I'll make it the whole week. But these are the questions I will hopefully have an answer to around this time next week. With that being said, if anyone needs to contact me e-mail is going to be your best bet, because I'm sure I'll check that, but I'm probably going to miss a lot elsewhere.\nReply via email",

But that's not the main reason. Nor is it a matter of perfection.\nIt's because I find it relaxing.\nCoding is like meditation for me. A perfect blend of focus and relaxation—a kind of timeless void. I'm often surprised when I look at the clock and realize how much time has passed.\nThey say time is money. Considering how rewarding these precious moments are to me, it’s a bargain.",

Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I'm planning to create an Apple Shortcut.\nI've also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:\nRSS Feed for All Content\nRSS Feed for Blog Posts\nRSS feed for Status Updates\nLet me know if you're interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.\nWishing you a great weekend!\nUpdate: Here's a tutorial.",

If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. \n Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…",
