          "description": "Letters of recommendation from faculty advisors play a critical role in the job market for Ph.D. economists. At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate‚Äôs potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.",

          "description": "Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China's income level. We quantify China's consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country's production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.",

Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.",

Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.\nA more recent example: here‚Äôs a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn‚Äôt available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.\nBeing able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?\nAgree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.\nThe tech side depends a lot on what you‚Äôre doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don‚Äôt need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you‚Äôre interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely.

Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it's a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it's incredibly hard to hide those from them.\nShow me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.\nLLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don't have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It's a really hard problem with LLM based tools.\nThere is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.",

          "description": "Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we've exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?\nI lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It's my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.\nGPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.\nFor example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build \"expert bots\" that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.\nIf you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.\nSimilarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.\nChasing after model improvements and \"GPT-5 will be PHD-level\" is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.\nModel vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don't know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.\nTake a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That's a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.",

In other words, the penalty for having a ‚Äòhigh-debt‚Äô codebase is now larger than ever.\nThis mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit \"weird\" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.\nPut another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.",

He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP's mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game.

It would be so useful for so many applications ‚Äì I'm a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless.

We will announce more about it in due time!\n\"Who uses Keras in production\": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.\n\"Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019\": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering & architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!",

It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things \"they shouldn't be\" was just‚Ä¶ insanely frustrating.\nNow in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade.

Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don't have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.\nBy assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it's fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that's okay.\nA small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don't want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.\nHappy blogging!",

Deciding to shake off the weekend haze, I went out and found myself wandering the streets of BTM. Suddenly, a small shop caught my eye, filled to the brim with books‚Äîas if there were no bricks in the walls, only shelves and stacks of paperbacks and hardcovers. Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside, calling out to see if anyone was there. An old, weathered hand raised itself from behind a towering pile, and a soft, respectful voice answered, ‚ÄúWhat do you want, sir?‚Äù\nStartled, I scanned the room until I spotted an old man in the midst of this sea of books. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúIs this a library or an old bookshop?‚Äù He chuckled and explained that it was a private libra‚Ä¶",

If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. \n Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine‚Äîcan we think of it‚Ä¶",
