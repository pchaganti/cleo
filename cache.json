Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.\nProfitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Gun Violence and the Marketing of Militarism appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.\nI don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.\nI overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase\nI do a lot of recreational coding. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.\nI love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.\nI rely a lot on intuition.\nI’m not a fan of TDD.\nI value data structures over algorithms.\nI don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.\nI prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.\nI'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math\nThat's it for now :)",

That’s kind of insane to me, I was pretty sure no one was going to read this thing, and I’m still not 100% sure why people do. I’m just some person!! I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!\nAlso, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.",
