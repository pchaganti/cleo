          "description": "I’ll keep this one short and sweet.\nTesla was contacted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday after videos posted on social media showed the company’s robotaxis driving in a chaotic manner on public roads in Austin, Texas.\nElon Musk’s electric vehicle maker debuted autonomous trips in Austin on Sunday, opening the service to a limited number of riders by invitation only.\nIn the videos shared widely online, one Tesla robotaxi was spotted traveling the wrong way down a road, and another was shown braking hard in the middle of traffic, responding to “stationary police vehicles outside its driving path,” among several other examples.\n\nElon Musk is not that smart. He chose to use cameras only, and not Lidar, against the advice of his own engineers.\nChina has robotaxis already. They work fine. They have Lidar.\nTesla is doomed. Their cars are worse than those of their competitors and more expensive. Robotaxis aren’t going to work. The only thing saving Tesla right now is 100% tariffs on Chinese autos, but even non Chinese electric cars are better and often cheaper.\nMeanwhile Musk is in a feud with Trump, Trump has threatened to remove subsidies for Musk enterprises and Musk (again, an idiot) has said Trump should go ahead. And yes, he does need those subsidies.\nThe majority of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla, and it’s days are numbered. Meanwhile Starship keeps exploding, the last time during fueling, not even after launch. There are a lot of competitors to SpaceX, and w/o NASA contracts SpaceX doesn’t look so hot either. Right now NASA is stuck with Musk, but that’s not going to last.\nMusk isn’t going to be the world’s richest man much longer.\nIf you’ve read this far, and you read a lot of my articles, you might wish to Subscribe or donate. I’ve written over 3,500 posts, and the site, and Ian, take money to run.",

We all know necessity is the mother of all invention. And war is the mother of all necessity. The Russians haven’t missed a beat innovating. One of the most terrifying weapon systems is Russia’s thermobaric weapons. They now have at least three operating platforms to deliver these utterly destructive weapons. Thermobaric weapons are not illegal under the rules of war. They are accepted as valid and while the Ukrainians might complain, no one is listening.\nIf you recall the MOAB–so called Mother of all Bombs, was a thermobaric weapons.

Sean-Paul founded the (now defunct) Agonist blog back in the day, which was very important during the Iraq War. He also gave me my first salaried job as the managing editor of the Agonist. (I received some money for writing at BOPNews, but only some.)\nI’m pleased to have him here. Do take the time to read the author byline above posts so you know if it’s him or me. Because almost all writing here has been mine, historically, people often assume all posts are from me. Sean-Paul’s more of an old school blogger than I am. Remember that guest posters publish in part to give different takes than I would and I don’t pre-approve their posts, unless they’re very infrequent or new.\n(Those who remember Mandos will get this. Out of a hundred Mandos posts I might have agreed with one.) That said, Sean-Paul and I agree about most things.",

It piled up till it was almost four feet high, and some partial thaws meant that underneath all that snow was ice. Every time I had to walk in that direction I cursed the owners (there was an SUV that came and went, so I knew it wasn’t uninhabited.) And one time I did slip and I was furious, even though the pain of the fall was minor.\nThing is, I don’t enjoy being furious or upset. Oh, a little anger is sometimes nice enough, but overall it’s an unpleasant feeling unless you’ve been having even worse emotions like fear, despair, powerlessness or self-pity.\nThis is what Buddha called the second arrow.

In the wake of the Ukraine’s hybrid/asymmetric attack on Russia’s strategic bomber fleet–aka Operation Spiderweb–Russia is getting its revenge in the smartest way possible. Russia has begun a massive month long air/missile/drone campaign that is systematically attacking command and control centers all over the country. The latest was a Russian X-22 missile attack on a former drilling rig disguuised as a seaborne command and control center. A Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber launched the X-22 cruise missile where it reached Mach 4 and then dove into the command center and obliterated it. There are dozens of videos out now on reputable sites indicating this campaign is ongoing and will continue.\nThis is very, very bad news for the Ukraine. This might not be the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the middle.\nThe site for reasonably unbiased updates is Military TV. But, viewer beware, this is uncensored warfare.",
