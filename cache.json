Well, we do but not my part of the company.

We won't re-teach linear algebra to a developer applicant but we will pay a tech writer to go to school nights/weekends to get a degree in engineering (me, I did that).\nYes, we have extensive high school and college work-study/internships and participants make $72k/yr. with full benefits for the duration of the program. That pipeline is actually successful.\nNo, you can't work remotely. You (even programmers!) have to touch the things we build in order to build them and nobody has an ISO certified clean room in their house.\nYes, we pay well.\nNo, we don't pay as much as Meta. We build components for satellites that have been sold to space agencies and purchased by various departments/ministries of the environment, not your personal information to advertisers-- one party has more money to spend than the other.\nWe have shortages in mech/EE/Aero, shortages in software, and critical shortages in engineering technicians.\nOne issue is that we expect programmers to remember linear algebra and have more than the ability to shovel frameworks on top of each other until a phone app comes out the other side.",

There is no way to cancel online. There is no way to cancel via chat. You have to call. As soon as you call you're told the wait time is over 45 minutes. There is no call back option. Why should a consumer have to be on the phone for 45 minutes to cancel? (Typically they will drop the call after 45 minutes and you have to call again.) If you call Dish to sign up service the wait time is 0 minutes: they answer immediately. If you then tell that you're actually calling to cancel, they forward you to the cancellation number with the wait. This is an abusive business practice, and banning it should not be controversial.",

Generalizing here but we really do take the moon for granted.\nI bought a 'big ass telescope' a few years ago in an effort to bootstrap a hobby that I'd flirted with for decades but never really committed to.  It's a Celestron 11\" SCT and I really had no idea what I was getting into.  When I think of space I think of things that are really small in the night sky, planets, galaxies, nebula...(turns out most of them aren't *that* small and I overshot the targets I had in mind)\nI kept trying to photo galaxies and star clusters and all of these exotic things but had a bunch of trouble with tracking with long exposures.  Out of frustration I ended up just pointing it at the boring ol' moon to at least get used to the equipment and workflows.\nI fell in love with Luna.\nThe magnification of this scope really allowed me to explore the surface in a way I never had before.  I got to know the 'map' and suddenly related to our celestial neighbor in a whole new way.  It was also the very first image I was actually not embarrassed to share - https://imgur.com/a/t9b1Uug\nI since then improved my knowledge and technical skill but the month of the moon at the end of 2021 was really pretty spectacular for me.",

          "description": "Passkeys are a terrible idea. They are security theater and a disaster for users waiting to happen.\nImagine you're on vacation and have lost your phone. You want to go to a cafe and log into a chat app, an email service, whatever to contact your family. In the world that passkey advocates want this is impossible via the passkey flow. If you can't authenticate via a primary device that contains your private key, you're f-ed. Service providers know this so of course they will provide recovery mechanisms. (Not consistent recovery mechanisms of course, each will have their own convoluted and likely to be broken ones). If the recovery mechanism allows for knowledge based recovery (challenge questions) then you're basically telling people that they need N passwords rather than one password. Maybe that challenge question is just a long password (recovery key). Maybe it requires access to another system, which you likely don't have in this circumstance. So you're either back to having passwords, or you're f-ed. Security theater or a disaster.\nA service only has value if I can access it. I should be able to sit down at any computer in the world with the knowledge in my head and get access to any online service to which I subscribe.",

I’m not afraid to delve into areas to understand them that might look “solved” to others. For example I have a CPU-only custom 2D pixel blitter engine  I wrote to make 2D games in styles practically impossible with modern GPU-based texture rendering engines, and I recently did 3D in it from scratch as well.\nAll the while re-evaluating all my assumptions and that of others.\nIf there’s ever a day where there’s an AI that can do these things, then I’ll gladly retire. But I think that’s generations away at best.\nHonestly this fear that there will soon be no need for human programmers stems from people who either themselves don’t understand how LLM’s work, or from people who do that have a business interest convincing others that it’s more than it is as a technology.
