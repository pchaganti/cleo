He has also written about the childlike nature of certain rock and pop songs, especially certain songs by The Beatles and Donovan. He has interviewed artists, musicians, writers and others from Chinua Achebe to John Lennon and many more. His works refer to everyone from Carl Jung to Tony Bennett; Rollo May to the Old Testament; Greg Bateson to Gaston Bachelard. At times, his ability to connect seemingly disparate phenomena is mind-blowing. Other time, one nods their head knowingly at a reference that they might have often considered just to see it verified via Cott’s quotation and argument tying the two things together. Some might consider his considerations too fanciful while others might see them as so simply obvious they wonder why he bothered to even write them down.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post It Must be High or Low appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

I would go to the library after school and put my name down on the waiting list for newly released books. I'd (im)patiently wait for my turn.\nBut for some reason, I never appreciated the books we were assigned to read in school. I'm not quite sure if it's due to the selection of books, or just the fact that I was required to read it (I’m not great at being told what to do). Either way, I would read the books I wanted, and read cliff notes (are cliff notes still a thing today?) of those that I didn't read for school.\nNeedless to say, I completely regret showing a lack of appreciation for the classic books. To make up for it, I am attempting to build up a collection of books I admire that I should've appreciated a long time ago. The goal is to get the covers I remember from back in the day, instead of the more modernized version.\nYesterday’s thrift finds:\nBridge to Terabithia\nA Wrinkle in Time\nThe Great Gatsby\nThe Metamorphoses\nIt joins my (still small) existing collection of:\nLord of the Flies\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\nA Tale of Two Cities\nFahrenheit 451\nGulliver's Travels\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\nNow I just need to find the time to re-read them all. Do you have a favorite classic must-read?\nBonus find: An original Sound of Music vinyl record -- this was a super happy find. I initially found a really scratched one, but thankfully found a total of THREE at the thrift store. I was able to pick the one that didn't have a lot of scratches on it. Super excited to play it on the record player.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

          "description": "The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It's like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).\nThis perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.\nOn the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let's say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.\nThinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.",
