          "description": "The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More\nThe post Murder in Beita: the IDF’s Killing of Ayşenur Eygi appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

          "description": "The very notion that it is acceptable to tie one's health in a civilized nation to having ample cash is clearly anathema to most of the world, but it's the way things are in the United States. Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More\nThe post Nice Health Ya Got There, Mister.

McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.\n> McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.\n> McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/boeing-planes-proble...",

It makes sense - it's basically a lossy compressed database of everything its ever read, and it generates output that is statistically likely - varying degrees of likeliness depending on the temperature, as well as how many times the particular weights your prompt ends up activating.\nThe magic of LLMs, especially one like this that supposedly has advanced reasoning, isn't the existing knowledge in its weights. The magic is that _it knows english_. It knows english at or above a level equal to most fluent speakers, and it also can produce output that is not just a likely output, but is a logical output. It's not _just_ an output engine. It's an engine that outputs.\nAsking it about nuanced details in the corpus of data it has read won't give you good output unless it read a bunch of it.\nOn the other hand, if you were to paste the entire documentation set to a tool it has never seen and ask it to use the tool in a way to accomplish your goals, THEN this model would be likely to produce useful output, despite the fact that it had never encountered the tool or its documentation before.\nDon't treat it as a database. Treat it as a naive but intelligent intern. Provide it data, give it a task, and let it surprise you with its output.",

In those 5 years, my hosting provider (DigitalOcean) received 3 subpoenas for my account information.\nThe first two were random. The 1st one was someone sent a bomb threat email to a university. The 2nd one was someone sending a phishing email.\nThe last and final subpoena was the most serious one. Some nation-state hackers from Qatar had ended up using my exit IP to break into some email accounts belonging to people they were interested in and spied upon them and stole some info.\nThankfully both the Tor Project and the EFF were able to help me pro-bono. The EFF lawyer that was assigned to me helped me fight this subpoena but ultimately we had to turn over my account information to the DOJ + I had to give an affidavit stating that I was simply just an operator and nothing on the server in question would be useful to their investigation (by design).\nThe stress of having to deal with law enforcement, lawyers, and having to entertain the possibility of having my home raided over something so silly ultimately led to me finally shutting down my exits.\nEven though I had all of my exits using a reduced exit policy and I would blacklist known malicious IPs and c2/malware infra from being able to use it, I was still a target.\nI feel law enforcement realizes this is a big weakness they can target since a lot of Tor exit operators are individuals with not a lot of resources to fight them. They can use the legal system to scare operators into shutting down.\nI one day hope to resume running exits as I find it rewarding to be able to help people from around the world in a small way.",

To some degree, sure — most folks probably don't notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.\nBut my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she'd have no idea what the term \"continuity\" means in this context. She notices that it's easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it's so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there's very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn't need to write down passwords anymore.\nI think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don't have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity — long before my mother did — it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I'm a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.\nI'm also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they're switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.",

It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models \"boring\".\nThe reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I'll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.\nShe can't tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.\nYou can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn't know how to get back.\nYou could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn't notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn't know they even exist.\nAll the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.\nYou might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she's highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It's not that she's unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn't care.\nIt's becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.\nI think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don't buy the pro and they're desperate for selling points in the regular model.\nIf the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.",

          "description": "I have mild tinnitus and the best advice I've ever read on the internet for it is: Stop reading. Don't look up information about tinnitus. Don't think about it. If you happen to notice it, try to distract yourself immediately. There maybe legitimate hearing damage but for the psychological aspect, the more you think about it the worse it becomes. I think I saw a quora answer somewhere where the doctor said \"Nobody complains about tinnitus while playing Playstation\". And it's very true. Until this post just now, I hadn't thought about it in weeks (months?).",

As in people use private GitHub repos thinking that’s THE way you work with git. If GitHub was just for open source hosting I suspect they’d have trouble monetising like sourceforge clearly did which led to scammy attempts to make money.

Google was 100% consistent on this from the day it launched to the day it folded. It was not trying to make money, or whatever\nI was there, working on it, when it was 4 of us :)\nSo to write all these funny things about taste or what not, is totally besides the point.\nWe folded it up because we achieved the goal we sought at the time, and didn't see a reason to continue.\nPeople could get a good experience with the competition that now existed, and we would have just ended up cannibalizing the market.\nSo we chose to exit, and worked with Github/bitbucket/others to provide migration tools.\nAll of this would have been easy to find out simply by asking, but it appears nobody bothers to actually ask other people things anymore, and I guess that doesn't make as good a story as \"we totally destroyed them because they had no taste, so they up and folded\".",

This is my contribution.\nAs someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.\nActive alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I'd been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours.

I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.\nThis will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized \"here's an important update\" kinda thing but that's a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don't think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.\nSo here's a blog. How often will I post here? I don't know! I don't care! It's actually kind of nice! I don't need to give a shit about it. It's a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don't need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!\nSubscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.\nIf you'd like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.\nThanks for reading and if you're coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active.

I first heard about them in an article by Maggie Appleton where she wrote:\nGardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.\nI’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  It's a place where I can experiment with creative projects and test new ideas.\nSome Examples\nThis week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.\n\nNeither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.\nI also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.\nI’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.\nOver time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.\nNone of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?",

Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist's advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love.

          "description": "I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.\nThere came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.\nI continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.\nWhile I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.\nI’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.\nReply via email",

Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.\nIt pleases me that Bear Blog doesn't have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals.

Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.\nEver since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.\nYesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.\nAlthough I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.\nIt was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.\nAnd if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.\n55/100\nReply by email",

          "description": "Image Gallery for Bear Blog\nThis gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It's also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.\nActually, the gallery add-on itself isn't very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here's the result (instructions below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nThe gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a \"section\") with the class gallery. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nSince the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nFinally, add the following styles to your theme:\n/* Gallery */\n.gallery ul  {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-auto-rows: 150px;\n  grid-gap: 12px;\n  padding: 20px 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.gallery li {\n  position: relative;\n  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);\n}\n.gallery img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n\nThere have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.\nI hope you find the gallery useful!",
