But for all her faults, Harris isn’t stupid. In fact, she’s demonstrated her ability to swiftly master and deftly deploy the finer points of Clintonian triangulation, the strategy of political bait-and-switch that prioritizes running against the core issues held by her own party, even policies she once enthusiastically promoted as signature features of her own previous campaigns. Pulling this off required some pretty adroit political gymnastics, where Harris had to completely reverse herself without showing the strain over long-held positions on fracking, immigration, asylum, a human rights-based foreign policy, student loan forgiveness, torture, the death penalty, and a single-payer health care system. But she sold these policy retreats so smoothly that the Democratic base eagerly embraced her joyful politics of austerity, aggressive policing and genocide with a smile.

A crow attacked me out of the blue. Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me. Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building. That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me. It was a little spooky.\nWhen I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley. The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony. On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape. Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.\nI went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder. To this day it still amazes me that the crow's mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs.",

A core belief that Anand and I have held dear for years, and is still on our About page to this day, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o'clock-news reporting. It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers by providing high-quality content\nThat’s the core of it. And too bad they’re off.

I don't remember the exact specs but I do remember that the GPU was failing, there were weird video glitches all the time, and the battery held a charge for about 15 minutes.\nThat was my first experience with Linux.

There basically is nothing like Anandtech; the depth, the ability to explain, the lack of sensationalism, and the integrity in benchmarking (I still vividly remember when they noticed an issue with HPET in Windows affecting their benchmarks, and promptly pulled all of them offline until they could reassess). Chips and Cheese is great but only covers a certain segment of it.\nIn the end, I would assume it just boiled down to lack of money. There were people among us who would gladly pay for this kind of coverage, but Anandtech said at some point they had considered it and couldn't find a good model. (As an aside, I pay for LWN, and I would pay for something that covered similar areas to Phoronix but actually was good.)",

Two years ago, I budgeted over $6000 for my desired solar setup (at least 1200Ah of battery, at least 2400W of solar, plus various controllers and other components). It was expensive enough for me to hold off, and more importantly, I didn't have the space on my current RV for the solar panels.\nIn just the two years since then, prices on batteries and panels have dropped 25% or more, and solar power per square foot at a good price point has gone up significantly (400W monocrystalline panels can be gotten for $200, in the same form factor as the 200W panels I had been budgeting for).

That is a natural consequence of authoritarian thinking, which is the entire premise and culture of the TSA. Any institution that covers up and ignores existential risks instead of confronting them head on will eventually implode by consequences of its own negligence- which hopefully will happen to the TSA.",

          "description": "The current comments seem to say this is rings the death knell of social media and that this just leads to government censorship. I'm not so sure.\nI think the ultimate problem is that social media is not unbiased — it curates what people are shown. In that role they are no longer an impartial party merely hosting content. It seems this ruling is saying that the curation being algorithmic does not absolve the companies from liability.\nIn a very general sense, this ruling could be seen as a form of net neutrality. Currently social media platforms favor certain content, while down weighting others. Sure, it might be at a different level than peer agreements between ISPs and websites, but it amounts to a similar phenomenon when most people interact on social media through the feed.\nHonestly, I think I'd love to see what changes this ruling brings about. HN is quite literally the only social media site (loosely interpreted) I even have an account on anymore, mainly because of how truly awful all the sites have become. Maybe this will make social media more palatable again? Maybe not, but I'm inclined to see what shakes out.",

          "description": "I have a PhD in Physics from Berkeley. Still, in the strictest real estate sense, my best and highest use is as a dishwasher.\nI was managing a small optics factory in Livermore. We made laser mirrors to order there — any wavelength, any reflectivity, any angle, any polarization, you name it. I was working my ass off and was unmarried at the time. Thanksgiving came around and I had nowhere to go. But I hooked up with a church in San Jose that had a dinner for poor people and went as a volunteer. After serving the dinner, I wandered back into the dish room. I immediately went over to the sink and kicked out the lady who was pretending to work. I then washed all the dishes and left.\nComes one year later.  I’m in the exact same situation.  I call up that church.  The lady says, “Oh, that’s very nice of you.  But we don’t need any more volunteers, we have enough.”  Oh shit.  What to do.  I found my old replica army parka I had bought in a Cambridge surplus store 20 years earlier. I went as a poor person. I didn’t want to be alone.\nThe first thing I found out is that poor people are herded, controlled, treated like children. We had to wait outside the church in the mild cold until permitted to enter, in a kind of line. So I sit down.  I will never forget the beatific smiles of the volunteers that served us.  This was performance art, and they were the stars.  Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this, I’m sure. So the meal ends. I walk back into the dish room, survey the situation, once again kick out whoever was pretending to do the dishes, do the dishes, and leave.",

The player rarely backtracks, and for good reason - the few times the character does turn around and look back at something a second time, it has changed significantly (the most noticeable I think is the room with the grey wall and triangle sign).\nThis falls in line with how we'd expect a diffusion model to behave - it's trained on many billions of frames of gameplay, so it's very good at generating a plausible -next- frame of gameplay based on some previous frames.

Google here uses SD 1.4, as the core of the diffusion model, which is a nice reminder that open models are useful to even giant cloud monopolies.\nThe two main things of note I took away from the summary were: 1) they got infinite training data using agents playing doom (makes sense), and 2) they added Gaussian noise to source frames and rewarded the agent for ‘correcting’ sequential frames back, and said this was critical to get long range stable ‘rendering’ out of the model.\nThat last is intriguing — they explain the intuition as teaching the model to do error correction / guide it to be stable.\nFinally, I wonder if this model would be easy to fine tune for ‘photo realistic’ / ray traced restyling — I’d be super curious to see how hard it would be to get a ‘nicer’ rendering out of this model, treating it as a doom foundation model of sorts.\nAnyway, a fun idea that worked!

Mono's legacy goals, which are to be a portable CLR (.NET) runtime for platforms that Microsoft didn't care about, don't make much sense today.\nMono made a lot of sense for running places where full .NET didn't, like in full AOT environments like on the iPhone where you can't JIT, or for random architectures that don't matter anymore but once did for Linux (Alpha, Itanium, PPC, MIPs, etc.). When Microsoft bought Xamarin (which itself was born out of the ashes of the Novell shutdown of the Mono effort) and started the DotNET Core efforts to make .NET more portable itself and less a system-provided framework and merge in a lot of the stuff Mono did a single more focused project made more sense.\nMono was still left out there to support the edge cases where DotNET Core didn't make sense, which was mostly things like being a backend for Wine stuff in some cases, some GNOME Desktop stuff (via GTK#, which is pretty dead now), and older niche use cases (second life and Unity still embed mono as a runtime for their systems). The project was limping, though, and sharing a standard library but different runtimes after much merging. Mono's runtime was always a little more portable (C instead of C++) and more accessible to experiment with, but we need that less and less, but it's still perfect for Wine. So, having it live on in Wine makes sense. It's a natural fit.",

The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.\nThis thought reminded me of an excellent essay by Paul Graham, Write Like You Talk.

The next day I changed my mind, which I wrote about in the post \"The blog that refuses to die.\"\nYesterday, I launched a membership called Birming Buddies. When I woke up this morning after a long and good night's sleep, I realized it didn't feel right. I have now removed the page.\nIt probably sounds crazy – and maybe it is.\nBut neither the decision to start Birming Buddies nor to shut down the blog were impulsive actions. It's always been a long period of consideration before I hit the OK button. Once I've done that, I quickly realize whether it was the right decision or not.\nIt's as if I can't reason my way through some decisions. I have to put them into action to really be able to determine what is right and what is not. Not very practical, I know, but that's apparently how I work.\nAnyway, no harm done. The member fees are  refunded and the blog lives on. And I'll continue to develop the Bearming theme. Today I released an add-on to show excerpts of your blog posts (see example on my home page), and a new color palette named Green Screen.\nI hope you have the patience to continue following my rather crooked blog journey. Hopefully, the transparency will bring some comfort to those who can relate.\nBy the way, I also launched a newsletter today. Subscribe now, who knows, maybe I'll delete it tomorrow ;)\nI wish you a wonderful weekend!",

          "description": "First day back to work.\nOne of my self-sabotaging behavior is my occasional inability to set boundaries, specifically when it comes to my personal time and work.\nI rarely take days off from work. I know that it’s a problem because I have maxed out my vacation accrual days (like now) during several occasions. When I do take the time off from work, I still check my messages in case there’s something on fire and I need to fix it. I also have my notifications on in the evenings, because some of my co-workers also don’t have boundaries when it comes to work, and will ping me because they too are working late.\nI know, it’s bad.\nThis time around, very in line with my Do Not Disturb mentality, I decided to turn my Slack messages and work email notifications off during my time off.\nIt worked out so well. I mostly didn’t think about work. I didn’t see any messages that needed my attention right away. I didn’t have to think about the things I need to solve for my team during my time off. I had a clear separation of me enjoying my time off, and work that stresses me out more than it should.\nBecause of this, I decided to make this separation a little bit more permanent. I’m going to actually turn my (work) notifications off when it’s time to log off, so that I’m not unintentionally working during the evenings. We’ll see if this pans out.\nJust the little things to get my mental health sorted out.\n29/31 - Blaugust\nReply by email",

Although I would love to buy all of the books, it's just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.\nI loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.\nI went to libraries less and less growing up. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn't unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.\nEnter Libby.\nIf you haven't heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library's entire e-book collection.\nI started a Libby account with a local library card to start with. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I'm a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards = even more selection of books.\nNow, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?\nI got myself yet another library card.\nThinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point.

          "description": "I know what you’re thinking:\n“Not another blog challenge!”\nBut hear me out...\nThere’s been a debate lately about the existence or non-existence of blog challenges. The criticism has been that quantity takes precedence over quality. Even though there haven’t been any requirements for daily posts, it’s sort of become the norm to post every day.\nWith that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A \"challenge\" where quality comes first – and only.\nThe idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your \"best\" during the month.\nThe post that...\n...you are most proud of.\n...was the hardest to write.\n...is the most personal.\n...best represents you.\n...made you think in new ways.\nOr whatever you base \"best\" on. Your favorite, simply put.\nWhy this challenge?\nAs a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.\nIf you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.\nPlease note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.\nParticipants\nRobert Birming\nAlexandra\nNetigen\nNikki\nJd\nJedda\nBrandon\nDominik\nShrutarshi Basu\nLou Plummer\nJason Kratz\nBarry Sampson",
