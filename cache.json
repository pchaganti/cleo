Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink's anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom.

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

As described in our previous post, bank failures—including those that involve bank runs—are typically preceded by a slow deterioration of bank fundamentals and are hence remarkably predictable. In this final post of our three-part series, we relate the findings discussed previously to theories of bank failures, and we discuss the policy implications of our findings.",

There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with \"driver impairment\" tech which was called a \"kill switch\". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just \"sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements\" and \"block the driver from operating the vehicle\". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497\nAnyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration.

But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying \"FBO\" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.\nFWIW, after seeing \"how the sausage is made\", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.\nSee https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/11/08/what-th...",

From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.\n> All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]\n> So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.\nhttps://daringfireball.net/2019/02/on_covering_webcams",

          "description": "It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.\nBecause of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.\nDespite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.",

          "description": "I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.\nRegarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.\nIf you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents. They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.\n[1] https://www.regeringen.dk/media/13261/aftale-om-et-groent-da...\n[2] https://mgtp.dk/media/iinpdy3w/aftale_om_implementering_af_e...",

          "description": "Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.\nAfter moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple \"hello\" while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.\nAnd wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.\nFor now, I’m enjoying my role as a \"hello-er\" and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a \"hello-er\" could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.",

          "description": "I woke up this morning thinking about Bobby, the mighty Dachshund, back home in Kerala. He stays with my brother and parents. We adopted him in late 2019. When I went to pick him up, I saw his mum and dad - both typical miniature Dachshunds, as they say. His siblings also looked typical: flat, long-bodied with short legs. But Bobby was different. He had long legs and a bit shorter ears. He didn't look like any of them, which made him stand out most wonderfully.\nOn our first vet visit and health checkup, people started asking -- \"is he really a Dachshund?.\" When friends visited, they'd always question his origins. Their questions, though innocent, sometimes stung.\nSometimes, kids peek through our gate to look at Bobby. They tease him, saying he doesn't look like a real wiener dog. Bobby doesn't seem to mind - he just barks at them. Sure, he's more built than typical Dachshunds and has a somewhat intimidating presence when he's in alert mode. But when he's curled up in my mom's lap or playing with my brother, he's just our goofy, loving Bobby.\nI did check with vets. It's the gene; it's nature, and we don't care what others say.\nWatching Bobby rejoice daily with such confidence despite being different has taught us all something valuable. He doesn't waste time wondering why he doesn't look like other Dachshunds - he's too busy living his best life, whether it's pushing a stray cat into the household well (yes, it happened once, and we saved the cat) or chasing frogs in the monsoon season.\nSpeaking of unique personalities, here in Chengdu, we have another character altogether - Coco, our miniature schnauzer. She's a tiny little lady with enough attitude for three dogs. I'll share more about her next time.",

          "description": "After a two-month writing hiatus, I'm back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.\nTwo weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I'm gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.\nTransportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I've opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.\nThis isn't my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I'm visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I've been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic \"konnichiwa\"s.\nMy ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.\nMy professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I'll join a new workplace where I've already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I'm aware that I'm really lucky to have found such an environment, and I'm hopeful about building a long-term community here.",

          "description": "As I strolled through yet another city on a mid-week trip, I came across a cozy-looking coffee shop. Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today's newspaper.\nI had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I've always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.\nAn…",

We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt.
