An egregious hack and one-man state-controlled news outlet, Krauthammer ceaselessly churned out bilge throughout his career, with a heavy focus on “America’s special role” in the world, its superficially similar but somehow entirely distinctive  “special place” in the world, and the “special responsibility” the United States must carry on its shoulders as a result.

In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.",

In this post, we argue instead that banks and NBFIs are better described as intimately interconnected, with NBFIs being especially dependent on banks both for term loans and lines of credit.",

He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I've learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.\nThe war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I've read not because of it's writing but because if it's relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.\nBrandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It's such a perfect series. Then there's the Stormlight Archive and it's huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).\nHaikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It's about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.\nIt just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it's all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.\nNaval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you've been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He's everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.",

Not all of the sites I run are on  BearBlog and I like the idea of owning my data. Umami is open-source, well maintained and on PikaPods. It's also super simple to use.\nFrom a collection standpoint, you just need to insert a call to a javascript script (like many analytics options) and the rest is (mostly) taken care of for you. There is one feature of both BearBlog analytics and Tinylytics that I wanted to be able to replicate in Umami and that's upvoting (called kudos in Tinylytics). That was a bit more complex to get going as it requires separate events for each page/post.\nThe first way I thought of was to just add a button in the post template that included the necessary event on-click…",

I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I'm failing more.\nI work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I coul…",

I was looking at the wall clock 45 minutes into my exam (that's what I do in exam halls). This particular time, it brought back memories of my childhood (like in 5th or 6th grade) when I used to play Monopoly with my friends during power cuts.\nAnother memory that recently surfaced depicted my school at 3:30 PM when classes would be over, and there would be clamoring in the corridor until we went to the parking lot. This was triggered by people chatting in front of the exam halls. There is a certain comfort in these noises.\nSavor these moments when they happen, but don't be jailed by them. Remember, time is a cruel mistress who will make you forget the struggles and just remember the good parts.\nIt's like what Andy says in The Office: \"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.\"",

          "description": "“You look tired today.”\nIt wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.\nFor the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.\nWe live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.\nAnd so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.\nYou see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.\nBe kind. Be gentle.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",
