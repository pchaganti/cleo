To be clear, Lee doesn’t think this is a bad thing. “I think we are years — or months, probably — away from a world where nobody thinks using AI for homework is considered cheating,” he said.\n\nHe’s stupid. But that’s OK, because he’s young. What studies are showing is that people who use AI too much get stupider.\nThe study surveyed 666 participants across various demographics to assess the impact of AI tools on critical thinking skills. Key findings included:\nCognitive Offloading: Frequent AI users were more likely to offload mental tasks, relying on the technology for problem-solving and decision-making rather than engaging in independent critical think…",

But that was not enough to restore the more than $400 million in grants that the Trump administration had canceled, or to prevent the administration from making even more demands.\nLaw firms like Paul Weiss, which thought they had escaped punishment by agreeing to do pro bono work for uncontroversial causes, discovered that Mr. Trump saw their agreements as a blank check for them to do his bidding.\n\n\n\n\nAs my colleagues have reported, the law firms discovered that they had agreed to deals that “did little to insulate them from his whims.” One expert at Yale Law School said the “admi…",

          "description": "Effective tariffs are over 100% on most goods coming in from China. Everything from medicine to toys to machine and electrical parts will start running out soon. If your air conditioner or fridge breaks, the parts necessary to it may not be available. America doesn’t make these parts, and it’s endless. For example, magnets used in appliances.\nSo, yes, if stock up if you can.\nNo way of knowing how long this will go on for, and it’s worth noting that some factories in China have just shut down, period. You’d think they’d move production to other countries and some are trying, but since Trump has declared his retard trade war with entire world, and since he’s completely fickle (he just put a 100% tariff on films, claiming national security, which isn’t even allowed for films, but who knows) decision makers are reluctant to re-shore to other countries. Trump might bet another one of his distempered starts and tariff them.\nAnyway, even after the trade war ends, which I suspect it will, prices will be higher and supply for some products will be thin, but unless you’re an insider in a particular industry it’s hard to say which ones. Setting up production in the US takes time, sometimes years, and, again, because Trump is so fickle, hardly anyone is willing to invest. Ironically if Trump believably said “it’s going to be 100% on everyone forever, that would in some ways be better than the current situation, since at least people could make decisions and invest.\nNot also that even if the trade war ended tomorrow, the pipeline has been disrupted and there’s at least a two month gap to overcome.\nSo, rocky road ahead if you’re American. Stock up, strap in, and pray.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce. If you’d like to support my writing, I’d appreciate it.

          "description": "When I talk about the environment I usually say “Climate change & Environmental Degradation.” It’s important to understand that while these two reinforce each other, they aren’t the same thing.\nA UK-wide decline in bug splats recorded on car number plates indicates an “alarming” fall in the number of flying insects, UK scientists said in a survey published yesterday.\nThe 2024 Bugs Matter report revealed the numbers of flying insects found stuck to vehicle number plates had dropped by nearly 63 per cent since 2021.\n\nThis study from Germany in 2017 found a:\nMore than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas\nAnd there were decreases in the 1900s as well. Bug biodiversity and biomass is WAY down. Here’s a lovely chart from 2019.\n\nWe’re seeing this sort of crash, in both biodiversity and biomass for all sorts of species, not just bugs. Problem is that our food production and a pile of environmental processes related to water and atmosphere renewal are dependent on animals and plants. There’s massive loss of plankton, mammals, reptiles, bacteria in our soil and so on.\nThis stuff isn’t independent of climate change, but even without any climate change there’d still be plenty of it. The loss of wild areas, plus tons of pollution and the side effects of extraction and energy generation are largely to blame.\nCollapse of this “web of life” or “food web” is a huge danger to us, as well as being a monstrous crime against other forms of life.\nSo don’t think “climate change is it”. It isn’t, and it may not even be as important as loss of biodiversity.\n \nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.
