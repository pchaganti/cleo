He has also written about the childlike nature of certain rock and pop songs, especially certain songs by The Beatles and Donovan. He has interviewed artists, musicians, writers and others from Chinua Achebe to John Lennon and many more. His works refer to everyone from Carl Jung to Tony Bennett; Rollo May to the Old Testament; Greg Bateson to Gaston Bachelard. At times, his ability to connect seemingly disparate phenomena is mind-blowing. Other time, one nods their head knowingly at a reference that they might have often considered just to see it verified via Cott’s quotation and argument tying the two things together. Some might consider his considerations too fanciful while others might see them as so simply obvious they wonder why he bothered to even write them down.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post It Must be High or Low appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Because the Bantu languages (most prominently: Swahili) and Japanese have similar sound systems.   Finnish is also oddly similar-sounding, or Hawaiian.  None of them are actually related.\nIt's because the syllable is restricted in the number of possible forms, in a similar way.  (And they all have approximately five vowels.  And a pitch accent.)  In Hawaiian, nothing but consonant + vowel syllables are possible.  Swahili and Japanese allow an optional final n sound.  Finnish is a little more flexible, and syllables can end with an n, r, l or t.  No consonant clusters, in any of the languages.  No syllables ending with consonants outside the restricted set (if any), in any of the languages.\nThis results in a lot of syllables of the form: i, a, ne, na, ka, ta, po, to...  \"Pokatokaino\".  I just made that up and it's probably not a Swahili, Finnish, Hawaiian, or Japanese word -- but it could be.\nThis basic pattern (consonant + vowel + maybe limited option for final consonant) is very common; it's the most common arrangement among the worlds languages.   Far more common than languages like English which allow monstrosities like \"strengths\" (which is 6 consonants and one vowel).",

          "description": "I think a lot of people don't realize that there was a decent size, but small market for SBCs for low-volume embedded work (including hobbyists) before Raspberry Pi. You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.\nBroadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.\n5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).",

          "description": "That's because RaspberryPis are no longer cheap throw away computers meant for education or hobbyists, they're developer kits for manufacturers that need a CPU running a well supported mainline Linux in their products.\nThe only reason they don't cost $500 or more is because the foundation needs the hobbyist market to write and support the open source BSP, without which the RPi would be just another poorly supported also-ran in an already crowded market. With how well supported mainline Linux is on the Pi, EEs would be willing to pay a lot more.",

I decided to setup a series of scripts that detect activity on ports that aren't open (and therefore there's no legitimate reason for the traffic to exist) and block those IP addresses from the service ports since the traffic source isn't to be trusted.\nSomething that came out of analysis of the blocked IP addresses was that I discovered a few untrustworthy /24 networks belonging to a bunch of \"internet security companies\" whose core business seems to depend on flooding the entire IPv4 space with daily scans. Blocking these Internet scanner networks significantly reduced the uninvited activity on my open service ports. And by significantly I mean easily over 50% of unwanted traffic is blocked.\nNetwork lists and various scripts to achieve my setup can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity\nInternet Scanner lists are here:\nhttps://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...\nLarge networks that seem responsible for more than their fair share of uninvited activity are listed here:\nhttps://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...\nI'm semi-aware of the futility of blocking IP addresses and networks. I do believe, however, that it can significantly reduce the load on the next layers of security that require computation for pattern matching etc.\nBe aware: there are footguns to be found here.",

          "description": "There are two different questions at play here, and we need to be careful what we wish for.\nThe first concern is the most legitimate one: can I stop an LLM from training itself on my data? This should be possible and Perplexity should absolutely make it easy to block them from training.\nThe second concern, though, is can Perplexity do a live web query to my website and present data from my website in a format that the user asks for? Arguing that we should ban this moves into very dangerous territory.\nEverything from ad blockers to reader mode to screen readers do exactly the same thing that Perplexity is doing here, with the only difference being that they tend to be exclusively local. The very nature of a \"user agent\" is to be an automated tool that manipulates content hosted on the internet according to the specifications given to the tool by the user. I have a hard time seeing an argument against Perplexity using this data in this way that wouldn't apply equally to countless tools that we already all use and which companies try with varying degrees of success to block.\nI don't want to live in a world where website owners can use DRM to force me to display their website in exactly the way that their designers envisioned it. I want to be able to write scripts to manipulate the page and present it in a way that's useful for me. I don't currently use llms this way, but I'm uncomfortable with arguing that it's unethical for them to do that so long as they're citing the source.",

          "description": "I spent about a year struggling with GJK back in the 1990s.\nIt's useful for collision detection in 3D, and it can also be used as a closest-points algorithm. As a closest-points algorithm, it's easy to understand the basics. You have two convex solids. Start with a random point on each, and get the distance between those points. On each solid, try to improve the distance by advancing along each edge from the current point. Pick the new closest point. Repeat.\nThis stops working when the closest point is no longer a vertex. That's when the \"simplex\" concept is needed. The closest points can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-edge, edge-face (no unique solution) and face-face (no unique solution). The simplex thing is really doing a case analysis of those cases.\nLots of things go wrong in practice. If you are doing a physics engine, objects will often settle into face-face contact. A single-point collision model will then result in vibration or incorrect movement. Also, as positions settle into face-face contact, the GJK algorithm runs into a small difference of large values problem that can result in a complete loss of floating point significance. \nThe termination condition can also cause infinite looping.\nIn theory, this is an elegant solution, but it's a difficult numerical analysis problem.\nDespite that, it's probably the fastest approach to the problem. It's O(log N) in normal cases, and O(1) for situations where the positions are closest to the previous positions and you use the last solution as the starting point.\nThe late Prof. Steven Cameron at Oxford did a lot of work on getting GJK right.\nI used GJK in \"Falling Bodies\", the first commercial 3D ragdoll system, in the late 1990s.",

But when the startup ends up selling for $250M, that $500k of 'early' selling would have been worth $5M (less any dilution between rounds) - hard not to regret the choice in that case even if hedging is going to be the correct choice 99% of the time.\nIMHO, it's very easy not to regret, with those particular numbers.\nI'd take $500K now plus possibly $45M later -- over $0 now and possibly $50M later.\nI'd take that deal even if \"possibly\" were \"guaranteed\".\n(Who might regret that is a founder who was otherwise already wealthy.)",

From what I could tell the early employees takes more risk than the founders because they don't get that magic token dollar turning into their share of the founding equity event and have to pay the fictional valuation of the seed to convert their options. Depending on how hot your startup is that can be a lot of money.\nAnyway that ended in tears, but I got what I was looking for from it. A look under the covers of the hot VC backed startup roller coaster.  I may be getting old and cynical, but it looked considerably more exploitative than what I saw at Google.  Obviously depends on the character of the founders and leaders, but the structure seems to be setup for toxicity.",

          "description": "I was mentally, physically and emotionally worn out when I left my previous startup after being an early employee. Despite that I really wanted to stay and be part of what my friends and I were building. Had I had the chance to 'de-risk my life' with some equity to replenish my empty bank account, which was empty from taking an early employee salary, I may have been able to stay but in the end I had to get out.\nGetting out for an early employee after funding rounds is expensive because buying options can hit you with massive tax bills on top of the cost of buying the options. Worse, the stats aren't great for a chance on return. Your lotto ticket gets expensive and risky as soon as you decide to leave.\nArticles like this one hammer home more and more to me how little VCs actually value early employees. Paying out founders to stay is a strategic move. Keeping them is worth it because they are the face of the company and turmoil at that level hurts their payout. Burning out early employees is not a concern because you can just swap them without drama. In fact, with the way options are structured and the 'industry wisdom' to hold off purchasing, it feels like a strategic move to burn out early employees since many employees that are forced out often can't even buy their options. They are left with nothing after all that work and risk. From a purely cynical view this is a great thing for VCs since now the company got all the benefit of an early employee and just lost all the costs.\nI don't know about the other three points, but I can guarantee you point 1 of 'right sizing perceptions' is wrong.",

Asymmetry is where things get weird.\nI’ve seen many founders who got deep into the fundraising cycles without ever realizing they could take a cent out. VCs will constantly tell you to let it all ride, and sometimes that works out, but for most people, having a little bit of financial security while you’re trying to change the world is necessary.\nThe best startups figure out how to manage liquidity through financing in a way that aligns incentives, keeps the goalposts at the mission, while allowing their teams to thrive.\nIt’s about alignment. If everyone is pulling in the same direction you’re going to execute the vision. Whether you win in the startup lottery is up to the threads of fate, but alignment is the straightest path towards a result.",

          "description": "I have always loved reading, even as a child. I remember reading under the covers until 2am, way past lights out and my bedtime. I would go to the library after school and put my name down on the waiting list for newly released books. I'd (im)patiently wait for my turn.\nBut for some reason, I never appreciated the books we were assigned to read in school. I'm not quite sure if it's due to the selection of books, or just the fact that I was required to read it (I’m not great at being told what to do). Either way, I would read the books I wanted, and read cliff notes (are cliff notes still a thing today?) of those that I didn't read for school.\nNeedless to say, I completely regret showing a lack of appreciation for the classic books. To make up for it, I am attempting to build up a collection of books I admire that I should've appreciated a long time ago. The goal is to get the covers I remember from back in the day, instead of the more modernized version.\nYesterday’s thrift finds:\nBridge to Terabithia\nA Wrinkle in Time\nThe Great Gatsby\nThe Metamorphoses\nIt joins my (still small) existing collection of:\nLord of the Flies\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\nA Tale of Two Cities\nFahrenheit 451\nGulliver's Travels\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\nNow I just need to find the time to re-read them all. Do you have a favorite classic must-read?\nBonus find: An original Sound of Music vinyl record -- this was a super happy find. I initially found a really scratched one, but thankfully found a total of THREE at the thrift store. I was able to pick the one that didn't have a lot of scratches on it. Super excited to play it on the record player.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

          "description": "The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It's like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).\nThis perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.\nOn the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let's say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.\nThinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.",

Which is weird because it didn’t feel that way before, but now.. I’m not quite sure what happened.\nWhen I get lucky, I get to read and discover some nice things happening to a stranger, or perhaps read about their current struggles and dilemma. When I’m not so lucky (which is half the time), I get to read how AI is the next big inevitable shining future, and make a million dollars in a few months with a written ad every three paragraphs.\nI guess it’s time to clean up my morning newspaper and manually curate it if I want to read quality human posts from now on. I feel sad for all the new, worthy blogs I won’t get to randomly discover because of this change, but I know I will eventually find my way to it if I’m meant to encounter it.\nLife has always been that way, and I know it always will.",
