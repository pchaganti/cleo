          "description": "I am blind, it was degenerative so it sounds different than what your kid has.\nI have a few pieces of advice. This is more about my own upbringing, so don't take any of it as an accusation towards you.\n1) Don't hide things about their condition or prospects.\nI grew up in a very loving home. However, my parents found out I was going blind when I was ~8, I didn't find out until I was 13.  My mother wanted to protect me from 'being the blind kid'. But I was. Not knowing made everything so much harder and more confusing.\n2) Don't rely too much on technology. Stick and dog are the best tools blind people have. Everything else, in my opinion, is a flash in the pan and won't have long term support. Not made by blind people and with minimal consulting for them. Like what a sighted person thinks a blind person needs after closing their eyes and walking around their house for a few minutes. (Screen readers are useful, I'm not talking about those.)\nFor a piece of tech I was excited for and is now dystopian: https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete\n3) Foster independence. The world is not made for us. It's also full of high speed metal deathtraps. The easiest thing to do is stay inside where I know where everything is. Even walking to the grocery store is a deeply uncomfortable endeavor. But I need to do it. I need to be able to live with that discomfort and not let it dissuade me from living the most human life I can.\nThe blind cane is very valuable. It took me too long to accept blindness as an identity, get over the shame, and start using it. I lost a lot of time to that.\nBlindness sucks in every conceivable way. It affects every part of ones life. But I had a good childhood and I have a good life. All things considered, I'm extremely lucky for the circumstances of my birth because of the family I was born into. You can't take away the blindness but you can still give them a wonderful life.",

And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation.\nI think the actual outcome of this policy is mixed.  I think it was a big case of corporate welfare that will result in somewhat increased chip production in the US.  I think this is a win for national security.  I don't think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won't be a win for economic output or quality of life.",

Because he is literally hacking/being judged by an algorithm, his KPIs will matter more and can be closely dissected. Startups aren't that easy in that sense, but KPIs still matter.\n2. Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.\n3. Building value > making money\n4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders/equity owners, not employees.\n5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.\nThe management/communication stuff is mostly about working on set/dealing with physical scale. You need a lot more hands dealing with logistics, which requires hardline communication and management. In startups, the team is usually really lean and technical, so management becomes more straightforward.\nI am also getting some bad culture vibes from the PDF and really dislike the writing style.

          "description": "Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.\nI work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it's able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many \"problem shapes\". For instance, I can give it a logic problem like \"i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially\" and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.\nYes, you probably wouldn't be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.\nside: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.\nMany of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.",

The word often carries different meanings depending on who you ask. Some define it as love and loyalty to one's country, a commitment to uphold a national belief or the core values they personally hold dear. Others, however, may view it with suspicion—closely associated with nationalism, pride, and even exclusion.

          "description": "Doing hard things is important. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. And lets be honest. It feels good to hit the bed at the end of the day when you know you worked hard. That self satisfaction is indescribable.\nBut how to do hard things? The answer is 'deliberate mental training'. When I was young I would get lazy, feel bad about myself and then get the work done. If I generated enough momentum it would last long, otherwise it would just last a few days and the cycle would repeat.\nMy perspective changed over the years. I don't know if it was one podcast or one book that did it or a bunch of things. But I came to look at myself more as an intellectual athlete. And just like an athlete needs physical training to get better, I needed mental training.\nA lot goes into an athlete achieving peak performance. Deliberate pracise, the right mindset, diet, the right tools and lets admit it - some genetics. It is the same for an intellectual athlete. Focus on what you can control and get better. The point is to improve 'your' peak performance and not to compete with some genetic freak training since they were born.\nAs far as frameworks go this is both very practical and very powerful. If you are out of shape and want to run a marathon you don't expect to do it one day one. You work up to it. You don't see some pro marathon runner on social media doing insane times and feel discouraged. You know your body is malleable. You can see the fat on it. The pain in your calves when you run. You know it gets better.\nThe same is true for our brains. Mental training makes your brain stronger. Be able to do hard things. To get started and stay focused. To not get frustrated when you hit blocks. All these are part of mental training. Something you get better at. And you need to keep training to not get out of shape. And if you ever go out of shape or get lazy you know you just need to train yourself back up to your glory days.\nStart training.",

          "description": "When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.\nAfter I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.\nAnyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.\nMy photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I'm choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.\nAnyways.\nFor those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:\nJEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.\nNotes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.\nSnaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.\n59/100\nReply by email",

          "description": "Like a lot of folks I know through Cohost and gamedev, I've started using Bear for blogging. This means I've left Wordpress behind after nearly 15 years on that service.\nBear is a fantastic blogging service for people who like to touch computers... but don't want to touch computers That Much. It has a web-based post composition UI which takes markdown, which is about all I want. I want to minimize the UI fuckery needed to put words on the internet, and these days, Wordpress is all about UI fuckery.\nI migrated over the vast majority of posts from my old Wordpress site and laboriously set up URL aliases, so all of them should continue to receive any incoming links they had in the past. I also took some time to heal some link rot in the older posts back between 2013-2016 or so... I was linking to a lot of twines which don't seem to be online at all anymore. Where possible, I've left a note about missing content.\nBear provides everything you need to migrate Wordpress content, but it isn't a simple task. The Bear documentation states that it takes the site owner only about 30 minutes to migrate a blog with about 60 posts, but it took me several days of intermittent work. That was mostly because I cared so much about setting up the dates and aliases correctly.\nIf you're seeing this in RSS, then you have proof that the RSS migration worked perfectly as well. (I don't have proof of that yet, which is part of why I'm running this post.) I selected Bear partially because it was so easy for me to confirm that I could set up an RSS alias identical to the one Wordpress had given me--and that whoever was following me from back in ancient days wouldn't lose track of what I was doing over here.\nThank you to Dante and Bruno for showing me this tool! It's 3 USD cheaper per month than my current Wordpress package, and a lot simpler.",

Luckily, there's a solution to the problem:\nStart blogging!\nThere's no better way. Or rather, it's the only way.\nWe might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it's only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.\nWe find ourselves by connecting with others.\nMy first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.\nThis blog is my first \"serious\" one in English. It's still relatively new and doesn't have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I'll start a separate blog about writing online. I don't know; time will tell...\nWhat I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.\nAre you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice?
