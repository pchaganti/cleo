          "description": "In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.",

Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls?

Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.",

The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below).

This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.",

Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

          "description": "At Ænix, we have a deep affection for Kubernetes and dream that all modern technologies will soon\nstart utilizing its remarkable patterns.\nHave you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this\nusing only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?\nOur experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.\nYou might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack\nfor bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply\nshift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.\nThis would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.\nWhy complicate things? - after all, …",

The level of and availability of Windows workload\nsupport has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by\nlarge enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes\nand new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test\nWindows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.\nThe Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a\nclosed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention\nof offering Windows.\nSome notable examples brought to the attention of SIG Windows were:\nAn issue …",

Went to community college while working part time, living in a 'separated' household (mom/dad did the splits), supported both my parents both emotionally and financially (as much as I could) through their transition and new living arrangements.  We were all immigrants, and still learning the ropes in this wonderful country.  I did not graduate college, but instead went the part-time/apprenticeship/gain-experience route, while going through many roles.  My baseline was to be a good citizen.  A good son, a good partner, good friend, good husband and a good dad (4 wonderful kids).  There were many good times, but also sad times, including when we lost our house and cars (2008), and that month when we literally didn't have money for food... but this country gives you many opportunities.  There are safety nets, use them!  You just have to focus on the goal:  Move forward!  There is always someone else who needs more help than you.  Stay the course, and try not to lose perspective.\nI'm one of the luckiest people alive because I live in this country, and was always able to surround myself with supportive, positive and forward thinkers.\nI don't know why I shared this.  Maybe because I don't care to blame society for my adverse experiences.  Through those experiences, I learned to lead.  I learned to listen.  I learned to value and appreciate.  I learned to live.",

I wish they had shown percentages with the visualization. They choose not to.\nI was underwhelmed by some points that seemed like they should have been more shocking. Look at the huge number of people in the many adverse experiences category who made it to college, and make a high salary. that was shocking! and look at the people who had no adverse experiences and still managed to end up poor. how does that happen?\nI was left with the impression that if the government threw a lot of resources at it we might be able to move a noticeable percentage of those people in a better direction, but not most of them.\nThe questions that remain are, how many people's lives could we improve and by how much? And, critically,  how much are we willing to collectively sacrifice to move that percentage of people in a positive direction?",

You have to be quite careful about understanding which coordinate reference system (CRS) and for visualization which projection is being used. The CRS is somewhat paranoia inducing if you don't have great infrastructure setup with the right tools to carry that metadata with your geospatial data.\nI've tested everything AWS has to offer, Postgres/PostGIS, Spark/DB, Snowflake, Trini, and ARCGis.\nI'm convinced the best tool for large scale geospatial work is Google BigQuery and it's not even close. It took an expensive multi hour query running on PostGIS deployed on an enormous m6a EC2 instance to less than 5 seconds that ran in the BigQuery free tier. It does make sense if you think about it, Google was early with Maps, but it is just stunning how much better they are in this specific niche domain.\nThis was using publicly available FEMA data that Snowflake and AWS services would just choke on, because the geometry column exceeded their maximum byte size. Spark doesn't even have geospatial data types and the open source packages that add support leave a lot to be desired.\nThis guy is running on-prem, so maybe this made sense, but I just would never bother.

They showed me that they were betting some wild parlays to hit on this game they had no interest in watching otherwise. They showed me that the apps keep track of your net earnings (I assume this is a legal requirement) and _all_ of them were in the negative between $400 and $800. Keep in mind that these are young men who just graduated college and we were all pretty broke.\nFlash forward, a lot of them still sports bet regularly with regular losses. I live in a different state now, but a group of my friends around here recently go into going to a casino near by. I was blown away by the justifications on their gambling habits. \"I usually win\" or \"I only gamble what I come in with\", but the latter isn't true and I've seen it with my own eyes. I met up with them (not to gamble, but to see a friend), and thirty minutes in one of them was asking the other for $40 so he could \"win it all back\" at the roulette table.\nIt blows my mind. We know so well that gambling is a losing battle. Some can have fun and call it the price of fun, but it's such a slippery slope to find yourself losing way more than you intended.\nAnecdotally, I notice that the women in my life gamble less.",

          "description": "The name is perfect. \"Etak\" refers to a system of navigation used by Micronesian and Polynesian seafarers to navigate from island to island in the vast Pacific Ocean. Much like this device, it operates by \"augmented dead reckoning\" (as it says in TFA).\nThe etak system of navigation involves navigating by stars and ocean swells to get the heading, but a key issue when navigating by dead reckoning over long distances is that if you're a fraction of a degree off you may miss your destination and never know it, so it's also vitally important to know how far you've gone. This is hard when there are no landmarks. The navigators estimated their distance by using intermediary islands off to the side, which they viewed as coming towards them (from their point of view, the navigator stays motionless on the open ocean while the world moves towards them) and past them. These reference islands were called etaks.\nHowever, confusingly, the etaks were generally not visible, being beyond the horizon, and sometimes did not even exist. The navigators would have named etaks that they pictured being just over the horizon, whether they were there or not, and would track their procession past their boat. When the set number of etaks had passed, they would know they were in the vicinity of the destination island. If they were not at the right time of day for birds to be out, they would then hang out in the area waiting to spot the birds leaving or returning at dawn or dusk.\nSo the system involves dead reckoning plus a system of turning the navigators' own well-developed intuition of how far they had travelled into a formalized system of generally-invisible islands that they used as a mental model to externalize this intuition.\n(My knowledge of this is from Cognition in the wild, Hutchins, E., 1995.)\nEdit: D'oh, I should have finished TFA. This is described at the end, although more roughly.",

Two judges on the panel that issued the ruling Friday were DeSantis appointees.\n> One new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first responders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if the intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn’t prevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25 feet back, which can make it more difficult.\n> The other requires that citizen review boards in Florida – intended to provide independent oversight of law enforcement actions – be re-established so that members are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one member be a retired law enforcement officer.\nI wonder if the first will stand up to Constitutional review. I imagine there are many First Amendment protected purposes for recording that may require the recorder to be within 25 feet of the officer. For example, if they're recording during windy conditions and need to hear what the officer says. I also wonder how the \"intent\" will be interpreted by courts. Probably in a way that is most favorable to LEOs.\nThe second law is just a straightforward neutering of citizen review boards.",

In DSA, if you're working with a 521-bit modulus, and you need a random k value for it, k needs to be random across all 521-bits.\nSystems programming intuition tells you that a 512-bit random number is, to within mind-boggling tolerances, as unguessable as a 521-bit random number. But that's not the point. A 512 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, which are legible to cryptanalysis as bias. In the DSA/ECDSA equation, this reduces through linear algebra to the Hidden Number Problem, solvable over some number of sample signatures for the private key using CVP.\nLater\nHere you go, from Sean Devlin's Cryptopals Set 8:\nhttps://cryptopals.com/sets/8/challenges/62.txt",

There was greater reduction in BP in the mouthguard group, and the hypothesis is just that participants simply wore them more when sleeping.\nBut the article also explicitly stated \"MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they’re outperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour during sleep.\"",

Even leaving the grain and blur aside, the texture of the objects depicted is also getting seriously screwed up, with unrealistic looking smoothing and weird places of heightened contrast unrelated to the original scene.\nMore generally, automatically second guessing the artistic choices of whoever originally color graded the film, for the sake of adding narratively gratuitous features like HDR or extremely high resolution, is a nasty thing to do. There might be moderately more dynamic range in the original physical film than there was in a digital copy; if so, by all means try to capture it in a new digitization while trying to match the visual impression of a theater projection to the extent practical. The \"AI\" features demonstrated here are incredibly tacky though.\nPeople put in charge of making new versions of beloved artworks need to have good taste and exercise some discretion. Art from different times and places looks different due to changes in both the medium and the culture, and we should enjoy those differences rather than trying to erase them all.",

It's a mistake on the part of whoever put together the image comparisons.\nThe culprit here is that the non-AI screenshots are taken from presumably 1080p non-HDR sources, while all the AI screenshots are taken from presumably 4K HDR sources. The \"AI\" images are all displayed in the completely wrong color space -- the dark+green/blue is exactly what HDR content looks like when played on software that doesn't correctly support decoding and displaying HDR content.\nIt's a shame that the creator of the comparison images doesn't know enough image processing to understand that you can't grab stills from HDR content from a player that doesn't properly support HDR.\nOn the other hand, the state of HDR support is a mess right now in software players. Playing HDR content in common players like VLC, QuickTime, IINA, and Infuse will give you significantly different results between all of them. So I can't actually blame the creator of the images 100%, because there isn't even a documented, standardized way to compare HDR to non-HDR content side-by-side, as far as I know (hence why each player maps the colors differently).",
