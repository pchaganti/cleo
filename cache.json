You want to show that your political party got 60% of the vote, so, you claim:\nMy party: 600 votes\nOpposition: 300 votes\nOther: 100 votes\nPresto, we got a good breakdown. The people will buy it....\nIt makes sense that 600 is exactly 60% of 1,000, because this was an artificial example.\nBut in the real world, we don't get 1,000 votes.\nWe get 10,058,774 votes. What are the odds that the % of votes you get is a round number like 60%, or 51.2%? They're infinitesimally small. You're much more likely to get ugly numbers, like 59.941323854% of the vote, unless you choose some artificial percentage and work backward.",

I've also done some odd jobs for readme.com-based startups and have dabbled in Docusaurus, Astro, and Hugo.\nreStructuredText (reST) by itself can be pretty rough. reST combined with Sphinx is pretty great.

Almost any manager of managers has been at Amazon a long time, in that same job for a long time. There is no upward mobility at the company, unless you have been in some org 5+ years. In Alexa, the people running the core ML teams have been in Alexa since it started. Most people in decision making positions just got there first (10-15 years ago)\nThe software engineering paradigms used within the company create brittle rube goldberg machines of events flowing everywhere in the company. Almost all of them are on maintenance mode, where the oncall burns out the engineers and prevents them from creating new products. There is no knowledge sharing between team members. Legacy team members guard their technical platform knowledge to solidify their place on the team.\nThe engineers themselves are not students of computer science, but just crunch out tickets.\nIf Amazon wants to change they need to remove a significant amount of tenured employees, and actually promote young engineers into decision making positions.\nAWS hasnt released an innovative product in a really long time",

Put another way, unsolicited advice is unwelcome.\n2. Smart people want to solve their own problems.  Don't offer solutions.  No one will feel empowered or much of a sense of accomplishment implementing your solution.  Instead tell them the challenges that they will face for various options and let them draw their own conclusions.\n3. Your spouse just wants to vent, UNLESS they say \"fix it\" in which case they want you to fix it, where \"fix\" means \"make it act like I want it to\".  Your spouse does not want to know how it works so that they can fix it themselves next time, and their mental model is wrong and they don't care to correct it.

Never tell someone what they should do, tell them what you would do in that situation.\n4. Remember that the purpose of giving advice is just to illuminate options, not to have someone follow what you recommend to the letter.\n5. As the advice giver understand that  you could be the one who is wrong.\nIt's never about trying to convince someone to do what you want, it's about showing them an option and letting them decide.",

          "description": "I think one of the key points that is often not understood widely is that car-centric infrastructure causes things to be spaced so much farther apart (with unpleasant empty tarmac) than necessary. If every building is surrounded by a border of 15 meters of roads, that significantly expands the distances that a person needs to travel to get anywhere. This further prioritises cars and drives demand and cultural norms.\nI don't think we should be trying to get away from cars altogether by any means, but I think we should seriously consider banning them almost entirely from city centres. There's still a need for emergency vehicles and goods to be transported within the city, so we would still need some roads, but we could eliminate a considerable number of lanes.",

A coworker offered to give me a ride each morning, and when I mentioned I could just walk they said 'the only pedestrians around here are homeless people'.

Wikipedia [1] is not the best of the sources, but it sums it up nicely:\n\"After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran took on the task of designing a \"survivable\" communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Then, most American military communications used high-frequency connections, which could be put out of action for many hours by a nuclear attack.\n[...]\nAfter proving survivability, Baran and his team needed to show proof of concept for that design so that it could be built. [...] The result was one of the first store-and-forward data layer switching protocols, a link-state/distance vector routing protocol, and an unproved connection-oriented transport protocol. Explicit detail of the designs can be found in the complete series of reports On Distributed Communications, published by RAND in 1964.\n[...]\nThe Distributed Network that Baran introduced was intended to route around damage.\n[...]\nIn 1969, when the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) started developing the idea of an internetworked set of terminals to share computing resources, the reference materials that they considered included Baran and the RAND Corporation's \"On Distributed Communications\" volumes. The resiliency of a packet-switched network that uses link-state routing protocols, which are used on the Internet, stems in some part from the research to develop a network that could survive a nuclear attack.\"\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran",

Does the water spill over the sides into the gutters, or smash into a wall and bounce back, creating more chop.\nA trained eye can see all the swimmers in Paris struggling in their last 10-20 meters (heck, an untrained eye can spot some of these).

I added a colleague's address and assured them that I'm not \"confused\", and will take an Uber now.\nThis was simply unbelievable in my world; for the next week I observed my colleague, whenever they took me out, or went to somewhere: we never walked outside. From the building to the parking lot, from the destination parking lot to the resto and vice versa.\nToday, of course, I know that there are walkable cities too, I enjoy walking from my Chicago hotel to the office building :-) every single time I enjoy my US visits, but after a couple weeks I can't wait to get back to my 98% car free European life.",

Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!\nI wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).\nFrankly, I've enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I'd personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it's got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.\nFastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I've now written around a dozen apps with. I'm really loving it!\nI hope some of you get a chance to try it out -- let me know what you think.",

          "description": "> Navajo also has a complex phenology [sic], featuring sounds that don’t exist in many other languages. It counts 33 consonants, including affricates and fricatives, and 12 vowels. (By comparison, the English alphabet has 21 and 5, respectively).\nSomeone else clarified this [0] but got flagged to death for being a bit too harsh, but I do think it's worth mentioning because this is used mistakenly as a prominent example of Navajo's difficulty: the raw numbers of consonants and vowels are not particularly extreme in Navajo, and the numbers that TFA cites for English are wrong.\nThey seem to have done a relatively simple analysis of the alphabet, but that's not how linguists think about phonology. The alphabet is our way of representing a much more complex system that underlies English, and English's vowel system in particular is far more complex than the alphabet makes it appear.\nOur total number of consonants sits at about 24—the alphabet alone would make you forget about some of our affricates (ch as in charge) and some of our fricatives (sh as in shush, zh as in vision, th as in theme, dh as in though), plus a nasal (ng as in ring).\nOur vowel system, meanwhile, has anywhere between ~16 in American English to ~25 in Received Pronunciation. Native speakers don't tend to realize just how complicated our vowels are, but getting them wrong is one of the most common ways to get recognized for having an accent.\nAll told, English has between 40 and 49 phonemes (again, depending on accent), which is quite comparable to Navajo's 45.\nI've no doubt that Navajo is harder to learn for most people than English is, but I don't think the phonology plays a big role in that. English's phonology is plenty difficult.\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41097443",

Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.\n“Danziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study—as well as other self-collected data—and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented—it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases”\n[1] Chatziathanasiou, K., 2022.

          "description": "He makes a good point about \"secret\" knowledge, but I don't think that's the real secret.\nI believe almost everyone, including the author here, misunderstands what made Minecraft take off.\nIt was NOT just the fact that you have creative control (which is what most people mistakenly assume is the main point) or that you need to learn how to craft to advance, or the procedural generation. It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!\nWithout exploring, crafting and building, you can't survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.\nAnd people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.\nPulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn't just lucky. He mastered programming and game design and created a novel experience.",

When we moved to California in 2019, I worked in the building right behind Cupid's Span. During lunch time, I would walk down Embarcadero, eat lunch at the Ferry Building, or just go to the building's rooftop to admire the views of the Bay Bridge.\nIt can get a little touristy in this area since at the end of the Embarcadero is Fisherman's Wharf. Most of the time tourists don't venture this far up away from Pier 39 (where the seals are), but sometimes they do because of the Ferry Building.\nI have walked, biked, scootered, and longboarded up and down this strip, and is truly one of my favorite things to see and do.\n\nCupid's Span - Sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.\n\nSan Francisco Clocktower and Ferry building - opened in 1898.\n\nOakland Bay Bridge - the bridge that connects San Francisco > Treasure Island > Oakland.

All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void.

(I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format.

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.\"\n– Belghast, Blaugust 2024 is Coming\nI hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...\nWish me luck!",

Refounded in 1977 after Italy’s “Hot Autumn,” they have been the second-largest and most workplace-focused IWA section for a long time after the Spanish CNT. They have a reputation for avoiding sectarianism, prioritizing solidarity, and maintaining cool heads. Together with the CNT and the German FAU they organized the recent Bilbao Conference of revolutionary unions, and were expelled from the IWA shortly after. [This and all other footnote…",

Following the agreements of its XI Congress in 2015, the CNT – together with the German FAU and the Italian USI – has organized an international conference of anarcho-syndicalist and revolutionary unions (November 26–27, Bilbao).

Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…",
