          "description": "While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins? We conclude with some high-level discussion points on potential regulations of stablecoins.",

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.",

Inflation has been gradually declining since 2022 without a notable slowdown in the labor market. Nonetheless, inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target and the path of the so-called final mile remains uncertain, as emphasized by Chair Powell during his press conference in January. In this post, we examine the unemployment-inflation trade-off over the past few years through the lens of a New Keynesian Phillips curve, based on our recent paper.

After reaching a peak of 11 percent in the second quarter of 2021, world trade prices dropped by more than five percentage points by the middle of 2023. U.S. import prices followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak and a deeper trough. In a new study, we investigate what drove these price movements by using information on the prices charged for products shipped from fifty-two exporters to fifty-two importers, comprising more than twenty-five million trade flows. We uncover several patterns in the data: (i) From 2021:Q1 to 2022:Q2, almost all of the growth in U.S. import prices can be attributed to global factors, that is, trends present in most countries; (ii) at the end of 2022, U.S. import price inflation started to be driven by U.S. demand factors; (iii) in 2023, foreign suppliers to the U.S. market caught up with demand and account for the decline in import price inflation, with a significant role played by China.",

          "description": "EDIT: Here's some more RE work on the matter. Has some symbol remapping information that was extracted from the prefix trie the backdoor used to hide strings. Looks like it tried to hide itself even from RE/analysis, too.\nhttps://gist.github.com/smx-smx/a6112d54777845d389bd7126d6e9...\nFull list of decoded strings here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/q3k/af3d93b6a1f399de28fe194add452d01\n--\nFor someone unfamiliar with openssl's internals (like me): The N value, I presume, is pulled from the `n` field of `rsa_st`:\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/56e63f570bd5a479439b...\nWhich is a `BIGNUM`:\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/56e63f570bd5a479439b...\nWhich appears to be a variable length type.\nThe back door pulls this from the certificate received from a remote attacker, attempts to decrypt it with ChaCha20, and if it decrypts successfully, passed to `system()`, which is essentially a simple wrapper that executes a line of shellscript under whichever user the process is currently executing.\nIf I'm understanding things correctly, this is worse than a public key bypass (which myself and I think a number of others presumed it might be) - a public key bypass would, in theory, only allow you access as the user you're logging in with. Assumedly, hardened SSH configurations would disallow root access.\nHowever, since this is an RCE in the context of e.g. an sshd process itself, this means that sshd running as root would allow the payload to itself run as root.\nWild.

          "description": "I would presume it's a state actor. Generally in the blackhat world, attackers have very precise targets. They want to attack this company or this group of individuals. But someone who backdoors such a core piece of open source infrastructure wants to cast a wide net to attack as many as possible. So that fits the profile of a government intelligence agency who is interested in surveilling, well, everything.\nOr it could in theory be malware authors (ransomware, etc). However these guys tend to aim at the low hanging fruits. They want to make a buck quickly. I don't think they have the patience and persistence to infiltrate an open source project for 2 long years to finally gain enough trust and access to backdoor it. On the other hand, a state actor is in for the long term, so they would spend that much time (and more) to accomplish that.\nSo that's my guess: Jia Tan is an employee of some intelligence agency. He chose to present an asian persona, but that's not necessarily who he truly represents. Could be anyone, really: Russia, China, Israel, or even the US, etc.\nEdit: given that Lasse Collin was the only maintainer of xz utils in 2022 before Jia Tan, I wouldn't be surprised if the state actor interfered with Lasse somehow. They could have done anything to distract him from the project: introduce a mistress in his life, give him a high-paying job, make his spouse sick so he has to care for her, etc. With Lasse not having as many hours to spend on the project, he would have been more likely to give access to a developer who shows up around the same time and who is highly motivated to contribute code. I would be interested to talk to Lasse to understand his circumstances around 2022.",

This was added in the last month or so.  If you're not on a rolling release distro, your version is probably older.\n- A debian or RPM based distro of Linux on x86_64. In an apparent attempt to make reverse engineering harder, it does not seem to apply when built outside of deb or rpm packaging. It is also specific to Linux.\n- Running OpenSSH sshd from systemd.  OpenSSH as patched by some distros only pulls in libsystemd for logging functionality, which pulls in the compromised liblzma5.\nDebian testing already has a version called '5.6.1+really5.4.5-1' that is really an older version 5.4, repackaged with a newer version to convince apt that it is in fact an upgrade.\nIt is possible there are other flaws or backdoors in liblzma5, though.",

Yes, he didn't put his judgement in every paragraph, but his description of SBF was:\na) absolutely damning! SBF's lack of empathy, his notion that (given that everyone else is stupid) he knew best and should basically ignore the advice of everyone else (particularly his elders), his naive utilitarianism without any deontological/virtue temperance, his reckless \"many-worlds\" risk-neutrality in gambling - that was all described in detail in the book, even if it was not explicitly condemned. Lewis didn't bother to show why these traits are bad. (I don't know what Lewis himself thought about them, but who cares? Show, don't tell.)\nb) empathetic, eliciting compassion. Sure, the kid was screwed up, but here's why. And, btw, you might well have turned out the same way under similar circumstances, but for the grace of god.\nMy conclusion: 1) Lewis's book was good and insightful, and it's unfair to describe it as an apologia. 2) SBF has severe moral deficiencies and belongs in prison for a long time, but not because he is \"evil\". 3) Let's have some damn humility.",
