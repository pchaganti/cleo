This surge, often referred to as the Great Resignation, or the Great Reshuffle, was uncommonly large for an economic expansion. In this post, we call attention to a related labor market change that has not been previously highlighted—a persistent change in retirement expectations, with workers reporting much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67. This decline is particularly notable for female workers and lower-income workers.",

          "description": "The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?",

While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not. Indeed, job shortfalls remain in more than a quarter of the country’s metro areas, including many in the New York-Northern New Jersey region. In fact, while employment is well above pre-pandemic levels in Northern New Jersey, jobs have only recently recovered in and around New York City, and most of upstate New York—like much of the Rust Belt—still has not fully recovered and has some of the largest job shortfalls in the country.",

The only first-class flights I've taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)\nBesides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that's just the stuff that I've benefited from personally. I know there's more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I've never heard of. He was very good to us all.\nWe've always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.  Simons making $3 billion, the rest of us making 90k apiece.",

The slapstick elements (trumpet noise, squishy balls) made it come across as light-hearted, rather than an ominous display of force by a large company crushing artists' tools.\nThis idea of 'squashing all these tools down to a thin slab of glass' made sense given their somewhat unusual focus on the thinness of the device. It was a bit of a throwback to the early 2010s smartphone innovation, where the size of the devices was the yardstick by which manufacturers would outdo each other. I would charitably interpret it as an uninspired marketing team trying to spin some version of Jobs' classic \"the iPhone is simultaneously an iPod, phone and internet device\" - however the party trick is old, and nobody's impressed anymore.\nPerhaps the blowback is a sign of a wider weariness that people have accumulated towards big tech companies over the past few years, mixed with a nebulous malaise about 'AI' and what it means for the status quo and people's livelihoods.",

How do those of you who feel so strongly about this ad get through daily life? If I was feeling so upset about something like this, life would be pretty bad. Genuine question.\nEDIT: I appreciate the amount of good-faith discussion on this comment. To be clear, if your reaction to the ad was along the lines of ‘this is distasteful and I don’t like it’, I totally get that. I’m referring to some of the comments I saw that likened it to ‘stress inducing’ or ‘like watching someone’s arm get cut off’ which are much more emotive.",

That happens, and might or might not be a good idea, depending.\nBut the way this story is told, it sounds like the manager/lead outright lied repeatedly up the chain of command, which is generally considered very-bad, in both healthy and unhealthy companies.\nI'll add that these things are vastly easier to armchair-quarterback.  Certainly we're all going to make mistakes, especially when put in difficult positions, and/or when overextended/fatigued.  But it helps to look at scenarios, to try to learn from them, and to think from a distance how they might've been handled better, so you're armed with that \"experience\", the next time you're tossed into a rough situation that has some similarities.",

In that city 75% of the metro lives in suburbs, drives in to downtown for work and promptly leaves. Until about 2012 or so. Urban redevelopment kicked in, adding (free!) transit, boosting retail, arts district events, a new stadium, and crucially - *massive office to housing conversion projects*.\nThere are tons of success stories like the historic Fidelity Tower at 909 Walnut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909_Walnut), a huge 35-story tower that sat vacant (creepy) for the better part of a decade and is now home to 159 units. Ditto with the Power & Light Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Power_and_Light_Bu...) (36 stories) - largely vacant for the better part of 20 years and now home to nearly 300 units. I could go on, every block has similar projects of 100+ year old buildings of nontrivial sizes that are now super unique apartments. I myself lived in the 30-story Commerce Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Tower) for a while and it was incredibly cheap to do so (~$1100/month for 750sqft 1 bed on the 14th floor), I had a 10 minute commute by foot to my office, it was awesome. Even the more squat, broad midsize banking buildings have had major success with residential conversions.\nThese kinds of conversions have been proven out when there is willpower to do so at the city level - people will move in and prices typically get competitive fast if done at scale. I've lived in SF for 4 years now and I'm convinced its a policy problem not an economic problem.",

Huge floorplate.  They had built the condo units around the edges, created a hallway, and then the inside was divided up into \"storage\" spaces.  Each condo owned the space directly across the hallway.  They were very large, and people had transformed them into offices, arcades, workshops, playrooms, theaters, etc.  You could do just about anything you wanted with the space, and because it wasn't \"living space\" you didn't have to worry so much about noise and the property taxes were lower than they otherwise would have been.\nYou can't sell it for a price that includes that space as \"living space\" either.

I was laughed at in one hipster joint for asking for a steamed or warmed cold-brew, and another one initially refused my request to warm it up saying that would make the coffee extremely sour. (It didn’t) Oh, and at least one other, maybe two, said they couldn’t warm cold brew (in view of both a steamer and microwave) or would have to charge extra (while someone’s cheaper latte was being steamed).\nReading the paper, it’s not clear whether their cold brew has lower acidity (higher pH) than the same coffee hot brewed. It does say that the sonic-brew has the same pH as the normal long-steep cold brew. I’m also curious if this cavitation/sonication brewing process is basically agitating the coffee, or doing something different, and how different it is from manually agitating a cold brew compared to letting it sit still for hours.",

Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.\nI'm happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We've noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It's no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we're nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.\nWe're trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well.

I even made a PowerPoint presentation trying to convince my mom to let me be a physicist. She was not impressed. I could only be a doctor or engineer.\nNow when I think about it I like physics but I don't feel the same passion I had. I could switch fields and go into physics now. I don't want to. It took a while to realise passion is a hoax. A fickle thing you can't rely upon.\nOnly last month I saw a lot of posts on Twitter about AI safety. It got me convinced that no one was paying attention to it much. That I was needed to save the world. Like some superhero. It was my purpose. The feeling only lasted a day.\nIf I made my career choices according to passion it would be a disaster. Hoping from one passion train to the other. Going nowhere. Whatever you do you will have hard days. Tasks which you don't like. Days where it is not fun but a slog. How do you push through when the reason you started on that trajectory is something as 'fickle' as passion?\nFor the longest time, I had value addition as the answer. Trying to surround myself with the right people and the right environment. With a combination of pride, you get from getting good at something. You get freedom and rewards proportional to the value you give society.\nAnd it still is true. But 'Passion' always wins on the branding. It is one word. Evokes strong emotion. It gets the lizard brain going. Only recently I found a word that can tickle my lizard brain the same way and sits well with my personal experience - 'Moral Imperative'.\nSam Altman put it wonderfully. He believes it is his 'Moral Imperative' to bring forth a techno-utopia. And all his choices come from it. It is a powerful thing to have. Your own 'Moral Imperative'. Something you feel is your moral obligation to do on this earth. It is sturdy and powerful. Something that guides the choices you make.\nI am trying to define my moral imperative. I believe you should too.",

          "description": "I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that's how I keep the curious-me happy!\nHowever, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.\nBut but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!\nThis got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?\nI pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:\nNo slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!\nCharacters are way more interesting to me than settings. I'd rather delve into a character's life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.\nI hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that's what I prefer.\nBook length doesn't bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.\nPlus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.\nSo, these are my current reading preferences, though I'm sure they'll evolve as I read more.\nFor now, I'm sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone soon.\nRight now, I'm reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It's packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I've breezed through about ten chapters and I'm already in love with it! 🫶",

Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.\nBrandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.\nStaring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.\nLessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.\nRichard Feynman's Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.",

          "description": "The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.\nSeeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…",

I'm hoping it will help folks gain the confidence to go out and... ship it!\nI often say 'machine learning in Elixir is ready for production'. On further reflection, I realised that this statement dramatically undersells the true potential and capabilities of machine learning within the Elixir ecosystem. (I already posted these reflections on Twitter).\nWhen I say \"production-ready,\" it's not just about the ability to deploy machine learning models in a live environment. In the context of Elixir, being production-ready means deep integration with the weird and wonderful thing called the BEAM (Bogdan/Björn's Erlang Abstract Machine). It means seamless compatibility with OTP (Open Telecom Platfo…",

          "description": "In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It's not poetic; it's real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here's the truth about living as a paradox:\nI'm drawn to happiness, sure, but I can't shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It's like there's a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I'm stuck in the middle.\nI'm not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there's a begrudging respect for the person I've become, scars and all.\nWhen I say \"I don't care,\" it's not because I'm indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It's just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.\nAttention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It's like I'm afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I'm just not used to being seen.\nI've been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I've tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.\nListening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn't. I'm great at keeping other people's secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I'd rather keep them locked away.\nSo yeah, I'm a walking contradiction. It's messy, it's confusing, but it's real. And maybe that's okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life's contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.",

It’s okay, though—my overworked feet will have time to recover in China. The sheer amount of walking I’ve done is testament both to how pedestrian friendly Tokyo is and to the way I still try to minmax my travels at the expense of my physical and mental health. Old habits die hard.\nI wrote a while back about how one of my favorite things about traveling is getting to microdose on cluelessness.

I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I've gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I've stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.\nWhen I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I'm not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert.
