And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.\nIt can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits.

Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy.

I've known a lot of weird nerds, am one myself, and there's lots of different flavors, most of them not autistic.\nSo much of talent is just really caring about something specific. Caring about it above other things. Specifically above external motivation and incentives. Do that and the weirdness grows naturally, neurodivergence isn't even necessary (though it might help)",

          "description": "I feel the article as well as most of the comments miss the most important difference between the two. Insurance, assuming the fee isn't too high, increases your utility of money while gambling decrease it.\nIf there is an event that happens 1 time in 100 that costs you $100k and you pay  $1.05k to insure against that would have a negative expected value in money terms but positive expected value in utility of money terms. It's hard to model utility of money curve, economists often use logarithm for convenience (it's easy to do math on logarithms) but whatever the specifics we know the function is concave. No one rational is going to flip a coin for their net worth or any significant part of it for example.\nWith this in mind insurance is a service worth paying for as long as the fee is lower than utility you gain from it. In a theoretical case that the fee is 0, that is expected value of money when taking the insurance is 0 you should always take it. In the opening example of 1 in 100 event that would be $1k USD fee.\nGambling is the opposite: you voluntarily stake money on event that wouldn't otherwise affect your financial situation. This decreases combined utility of you and your counter-party. Utility is higher if you both have $1000 than if one of you have $0 and the other $2000 for example.\nGambling, like excessive drinking or other activities that hurt the population as a whole is viewed as immoral by many moral systems. I think it's hard to argue against that - the more gambling there is the worse off the population is going to be. Not so with insurance.",

It's rather humbling.\nCollaborating with nontechnical people is oddly my favorite part of doing MLE work right now. It wasn't the case when I did basic web/db stuff. They see me as a magician. I see them as voodoo priests and priestesses. When we get something trained up and forecasting that we both like, it's super fulfilling. I think for both sides.\nMost of my modeling is healthcare related. I tease insights out of a monstrous data lake of claims, Rx, doctor notes, vital signs, diagnostic imagery, etc. What is also monstrous is how accessible this information is. HIPAA my left foot.\nSince you seemed to be asking about the temporal realities, it's about 3 hours of meetings a week, probably another 3 doing task grooming/preparatory stuff, fixing some ETL problem, or doing a one-off query for the business, the rest is swimming around in the data trying to find a slight edge to forecast something that surprised us for a $million or two using our historical snapshots.

I installed Windows for personal use for the first time recently (although I use it exclusively at work) and it drove me ABSOLUTELY BONKERS that my home drive was mapping to C:\\Users\\atribecalledqst\\OneDrive.\nWhat I hated the most was that the File Explorer just calls the folders in there e.g. \"Documents\" and \"Pictures\" without showing the full path. So it was hard to figure out just where in the file system you were looking -- a major annoyance if you do any work in the command-line!\nEven after switching OneDrive off and doing as much as I can to try and get rid of the OneDrive folder structure, I haven't been completely successful. You can make some -- but not all -- home folders (like Downloads, Documents, etc.) point directly to their place in the local user folder, but others, particularly Pictures, don't seem to be movable. Additionally, some programs still seem to want to use the OneDrive folder by default, like I think Office programs still do their best to use them.\nIn the grand scheme of things it's a small annoyance but god it annoys the shit out of me!

          "description": "Having written an SSH server that is used in a few larger places, I find the perspective of enabling these features on a per-address basis by default in the future troubling. First, with IPv4 this will have the potential to increasingly penalize innocent bystanders as CGNs are deployed. Worst case, this will give bad actors the option to lock the original owner out of their own server if they have a botnet host in the same network. With IPv6 on the other hand, it is trivially easy to get a new IP, so the protection method described here will be completely ineffective.\nFrom my experiments with several honeypots over a longer period of time, most of these attacks are dumb dictionary attacks. Unless you are using default everything (user, port, password), these attacks don't represent a significant threat and more targeted attacks won't be caught by this. (Please use SSH keys.)\nI have seen experienced sysadmins create the test user with the password of \"test\" on a live server on port 22 because they were having an \"autopilot moment\". It got hacked within 20 minutes of going online and these mechanisms wouldn't have saved it, the attacker got in on the second or third try.\nIf you want to have a read about unsolved problems around SSH that should be addressed, Tatu Ylonen (the inventor of SSH) has written a paper about it in 2019: https://helda.helsinki.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/471f0ff...",

Otherwise, the model is a standard autoregressive GPT. The consequences of this seemingly \"simple\" modification are significant:\n* The authors can prompt the trained model with part of a sequence and then decode the missing tokens, all at once, in parallel, regardless of order -- i.e., the model can in-fill in parallel.\n* The authors can compute conditional probability densities for every missing token in a sequence, again in parallel, i.e., densities for all missing tokens at once.\n* The authors propose a rejection-sampling method for generating in-fill tokens, again in parallel. Their method seems to work well in practice.\nI've added this to my reading list. Thank you for sharing it on HN.",

However, this conclusion is based on cross-sectional comparisons. This means, they look at different people at different ages, and make inferences on developmental trajectories based on these cross-sectional, age-related patterns. While this is often a starting point, cross-sectional research can suffer from sampling biases.\nA huge weakness in autism neuroimaging research is the un-representativeness of \ntheir samples. Nearly a third of individuals with autism have severe intellectual impairments (IQ's https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089123/  (open access).\nOur conclusion: Longitudinal evidence does not support the notion that early brain overgrowth is followed by volumetric regression, at least from early to late childhood.",

That's something taller than a football field, jetting off into space! I've only gotten to see a decommissioned Space Shuttle in person, but that was also amazing. Even its fuel tank [1] makes you feel just tiny, yet it's merely 47m.

          "description": "Minutes before I left home on Thursday one of my mom's coworkers pulled up on the driveway and handed me a plastic bag of zongzi as a going away gift. \"Good luck with the move!\" he said. \"Go do what you love.\"\nThat last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.\nA large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?\nIn Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that \"looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.\" I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I'm not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I'm nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I'm doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.",

          "description": "Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?\nWeekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.\nBy the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.\nIt's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.\nWhere is that petition for the 4-day work week?\nThis weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

It's so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.\nHe says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels \"less serious\".\nI turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.\nI don't worry so much about what people think of me. It's not that I don't care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I've come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.\nYou can't please them all – and that's fine!\nIn many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…\nBut that doesn’t feel very important.\nThe lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It's more fun and interesting to live.\nNo matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.\nWant more “proof”?

I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.\nWell, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.\nSo, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.\nIf you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.\nUntil then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited.
