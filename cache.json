          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins? We conclude with some high-level discussion points on potential regulations of stablecoins.",

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.",

The level of and availability of Windows workload\nsupport has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by\nlarge enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes\nand new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test\nWindows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.\nThe Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a\nclosed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention\nof offering Windows.…",

          "description": "Author: Sascha Grunert\nSeccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux\nkernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a\nprocess, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the\nkernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles\nOperator solve that problem by\nrunning as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that\ndistribution could be done by the container\nruntime.\nRuntimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:\na…",

The food options were really good and the BlueApron style meal-kits were amazing. The Alexa integration was also nice for being able to just verbally ask what's the next step on a recipe while you're busy stirring or chopping things.\nWhen it rolled out to Amazon Fresh stores, it was a breadth of fresh air. The painful clunkiness of self-checkout was gone. The slow and pointless exercise of unloading and reloading your cart was gone. You could just bring your reusable shopping bags, throw stuff in, and walk home. By far the most hassle-free shopping experience to be had.\nScan as you shop is a big step backwards and feels like you've got the annoying self-checkout experience looming over you the entire time you're there.\nThe selection and operating hours both took a hit during covid and never recovered.",

And as you evolve that great idea it changes and grows. It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more as you get in the subtleties of it.\nAnd you also find there's tremendous trade-offs that you have to make. There are just certain things you can't make electrons do. There are certain things you can't make plastic do or glass do. Or factories do, or robots do.\nAnd as you get in to all these things, designing a product is keeping 5000 things in your brain, these concepts. And fitting them all together and kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want. And every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.\nIt's that process that is the magic.\"",

The founder sees themselves as the ideas person but doesn’t have the situational awareness to recognize that their ideas aren’t that unique.\n2. The founder doesn’t understand that the value in a startup isn’t the idea but the ability to execute and build on that idea. For every very successful startup in X space there were 10x more with the same general idea but that failed to execute. The founder wants someone to built it for them but wants credit/equity for having the idea. In 99% of cases the value is created by the builders (technical cofounder) which instantly creates awkwardness of the founder wanting far more equity, credit, and control than their contributions warrant\nFor the above reasons I’d avoid 99% of asks for a technical co-founder like the plague.",

To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange.

Justine Tunney appears to enjoy extreme superstar status here, and it's hard to overstate the degree of social pressure that needed to be overcome at the time for the skeptic position to reach fixation (to begin with, what other LLM developments even hit upvote numbers like the +1300ish there or the +712 here at the time of writing?).\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35393284",

The canonical example is how to make cocaine, which ChatGPT will admonish you for even asking, while llama2-uncensored will happily describe the process which is only really interesting if you're an amateur chemist and want to be Scarface-that-knocks. (the recipe is relatively easy, it's getting access to the raw ingredients that's the hard part, same as with nukes.)\nif you accidentally use the word\"hack\" when trying to get ChatGPT to write some code for you. it'll stop and tell you that hacking is bad, and not a colloquial expression, and refuse to go further.\nprivacy reasons are another reason to try a local LLM. for the extremely paranoid (justified or not), a local LLM gives users a place to ask questions without the text being fed to a server somewhere for later lawsuit discovery (Google searches are routinely subpoenaed, it's only a matter of time until ChatGPT chats are as well.)\nThere's an uncensored model for vision available as well. The censored vision models won't play the shallow game of hot or not with you.\nThere are uncensored image generation models as well, but, ah, those are NSFW and not for polite company.

Among a long list of things, he had a moment in the spotlight recently for a long rant [1] where he \"gave up on AMD\" because their drivers sucked more than he expected. The situation is reasonably complex - AMD have some programmers working on ROCm who seemed to be operating at standard fare when that is really not what AMD needs right now (I personally, suspect there is/was a PM in a key position who didn't \"get it\", although I am not sure what it is either). As far as I know it got the attention of Lisa Su.\nI'm cheering him on, even though his complaints were a little melodramatic. My experience is the driver technically supports everything I could possibly want. The problem is if I spend an evening trying to do anything with OpenCL or ROCm the kernel hard-locks and I go to bed early. If the problem inside is what it looks like from the outside (repeating myself, a key manager somewhere just doesn't get the space) they really need some pressure from grumpy customers like George to realign their software development process.\nThat context might be related to this particular case. I see a suspicious folder called \"crash\" in this repo.\n[0] https://tinygrad.org/\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr0rWJhv9jU - as I recall he ran the demo suite and it crashed.",

And it introduces new boilerplate concepts which are hard for beginners to understand.\n- \"If the counter changes but parity does not (e.g. counter goes from 2 to 4), then we do unnecessary computation of the parity and unnecessary rendering.\" - Sounds like they want premature memoization.\n- \"What if another part of our UI just wants to render when the counter updates?\" Then I agree the strawman example is probably not what you want. At that point you might want to handle the state using signals, event handling, central state store (e.g. redux-like tools), or some other method. I think this is also what they meant by \"The counter state is tightly coupled to the rendering system.\"? Some of this document feels a little repetitive.\n- \"What if another part of our UI is dependent on isEven or parity alone?\" Sure, you could change your entire approach because of this if that's a really central part of your app, but most often it's not. And \"The render function, which is only dependent on parity must instead \"know\" that it actually needs to subscribe to counter.\" is often not an unreasonable obligation. I mean, that's one of the nice things about pure computed functions- it's easy to spot their inputs.",

Of course I was very motivated of doing only important research. After some time I even found a nice research topic and worked on it for over two years. Even my advisor pointed out that it was a very novel and foundational idea.\nAt the same time, a colleague published three papers in top conferences. Their approach was basically to look at publications from the previous conference, apply some delta that they had an advantage over other teams and publish this in the next round.\nReviewers were happy because their publications already got cited and they understood the topic well.\nWhereas my topic used an algorithm from the seventies that reviewers had to revisit. My topic didn't fit so well into the overall conference trend and so I still have way less citations than those incremental works.\nWhen someone asks me if it's worth doing a PhD I tend to say that you need to like the direction in which science is going.
