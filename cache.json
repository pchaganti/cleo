In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.",

I cannot at all get worked up over this, getting to the point I'd pull out the word \"poison\" to describe it.\nIt's nice that Kitty does most of what tmux does built in, but as the author points out, that's not really all that helpful for anyone who does any work over ssh.\nAnd to me, bundling all that into a terminal emulator is bloat. Terminals should be terminals. If I want a multiplexer on top of that, I will... use a multiplexer on top of that.\nI am potentially sympathetic to the idea that tmux and screen make it harder for terminal developers to add new features to their terminals. I don't really know enough about the issues involved to form an opinion. But from the perspective of a regular user, I do not want a multiplexer in my terminal app. When I need one, I prefer to reach for an app-agnostic multiplexer like tmux or screen.",

Listening in Winamp to one of only a few dozen possible songs that I had carefully downloaded.\nBeing able to randomly connect to people you would filter. Yes, I want to talk to someone more or less my age but in Iceland. Or any other country.\nBut most of all, the feeling of being connected. As a teenager in the autism spectrum, that was one of the best feelings I had at that time.\nMost people don’t get it when I say this, maybe someone here will, but to me it all started going downhill when people all of a sudden switched to a worse alternative, MSN. I see a direct line from there to the annoying easy-to-accept-while-hard-to-reject-but-always-there-anyway cookie pop-ups.\nAnd no, this is isn’t some form of Ostalgie where we long for past days of hardship with tender feelings. ICQ just had a great user experience as far as I am concerned and to this day I prefer it to existing alternatives from WhatsApp to Webex chat (don’t mention Teams please, I’m having a poetic moment). It was rather a feeling that perhaps other Brazilians will share: a longing, saudade, for the simpler (yes) but better and more poetic 90s, when ICQ connected you to a world that watched Brazil win the fourth World Cup, Ayrton Senna was inspiring generations to be healthier and their better selves and Mamonas Assassinas could only make us laugh, not cry…\nSo long, ICQ. You will always be part of why I love the internet.\nPS: I realize the timing of those events doesn’t necessarily align. But sentimentally they do.",

          "description": "Given the level of impact that this incident caused, I am surprised that the remediations did not go deeper. They ensured that the same problem could not happen again in the same way, but that's all. So some equivalent glitch somewhere down the road could lead to a similar result (or worse; not all customers might have the same \"robust and resilient architectural approach to managing risk of outage or failure\").\nExamples of things they could have done to systematically guard against inappropriate service termination / deletion in the future:\n1. When terminating a service, temporarily place it in a state where the service is unavailable but all data is retained and can be restored at the push of a button. Discard the data after a few days. This provides an opportunity for the customer to report the problem.\n2. Audit all deletion workflows for all services (they only mention having reviewed GCVE). Ensure that customers are notified in advance whenever any service is terminated, even if \"the deletion was triggered as a result of a parameter being left blank by Google operators using the internal tool\".\n3. Add manual review for any termination of a service that is in active use, above a certain size.\nAbsent these broader measures, I don't find this postmortem to be in the slightest bit reassuring. Given the are-you-f*ing-kidding-me nature of the incident, I would have expected any sensible provider who takes the slightest pride in their service, or even is merely interested in protecting their reputation, to visibly go over the top in ensuring nothing like this could happen again. Instead, they've done the bare minimum. That says something bad about the culture at Google Cloud.",

If I could just plug this in to my existing laptop and use it for reading specs, technical docs, …etc that would be amazing.\nAndroid tablet is a tough sell for my employer due to compliance, security, and such.  So buying one of those for work use would take like a year minimum gathering all the necessary approvals and likely would still get denied by someone.  But, a dumb monitor with no real OS I can expense that without approval.  just a heads up to my boss really to say I am buying this and here is why.\nI know you are a small company so have to pick your battles.  But, maybe something to consider down the road.\nEDIt: forgot to say, congrats on the launch.  Looks like a great product.",

She's been trying to get it replaced for months, but none of the \"Samsung approved\" repair shops around here can get a screen. Apparently they have screens meant for the same phone in different colors, but do not have the screen for her phone color. Samsung WILL NOT allow them to use a screen from a different color of the same phone, despite being a working part. Samsung has provided no ETA when the part will be available. This is the kind of problem that shouldn't exist. Would love it if our legislators would tell manufacturers to shove it, and if they want to be the exclusive source for parts that the parts must be sold at some limited/reasonable profit percentage and if they're not available they should not be able to limit the availability or function of 3rd party parts.",

I've only been a casual observer, but from my view point the community's reaction was... not great, to put it lightly.\nI get that a lot of us are tired of 'AI' being shoved down our throat at every possible turn. I get that a lot of us have privacy concerns. I get that maybe you don't want it in your terminal emulator.\nBut iTerm is a free (both as in gratis and as in libre) open source project. The developer released a feature that they were probably happy and excited about. It was off by default and didn't siphon data or do anything malicious. And a ton of reactions were as if iTerm had just added the devil incarnate or attacked people personally.\nDisliking the feature is fine. Voicing your concerns and feedback is fine. But it should always be gracious and in good faith. I think this is a good change, if only to pacify the masses, and I applaud the developer for taking these steps, but I don't like how we got here.\nEDIT: gnachman, if you're reading this, thank you for your tireless work on iTerm. It serves me extremely well whenever I'm on macOS and holds a special place in my heart. I bought a MacBook in 2013 and it was the first *nix system that I daily drove as a desktop for a long time. I installed iTerm  2 in my first week and it was a constant companion for many years.",

Long time lurker, so this is pretty cool to finally take part :)\nI made this because I wanted the eye-strain free and minimalist qualities of my kindle/Eink applied to so much more of what I do on a computer.\nLack of speed and ghosting felt like it made traditional Eink impossible to do most computing tasks. So we focused on making the most Paperlike epaper display that has no ghosting and high refresh rate - 60 to 120fps. We started working on this in 2018.\nWe developed our own custom epaper display tech we call LivePaper. We focused on solving the tradeoffs RLCDs traditionally have - around reflectance %, metallic-look / not Paperlike enough, viewing angle, white state, rainbow mura, parallax, resolution, size, lack of quality backlight, etc.\nFirst proof of concept in late 2021, and then it took us 2.5 years to get it into production.\nAnd we built a whole android tablet around it.\nIt’s essentially our attempt at making a remarkable tablet on steroids / kindle on steroids. Definitely some trade offs, but on the whole we think it’s worth it. (& on twitter a bunch of early customers seem to think so too)\nNote: it’s 60fps epaper, not off the shelf Eink. We spent years developing what we think is the best epaper display in the world and it’s exclusively manufactured by our display factory in Japan.\nThere’s still many cases where traditional Eink is going to be better (bistability, viewing angle, white state color, etc), but we feel for more general purpose computers you can code on and do google docs on and do fast multitouch amongst a thousand other things, the speed and lack of ghosting totally makes it worth it.\nThink of it as a Godzilla sized pebble watch with a decade of improvement\nOr think of it as a gameboy advanced, advanced",

They can just show that those records didn't mention it. The key decision-makers could simply have agreed to keep that fact close-to-the-vest -- they may have well understood that knocking off a high-profile actress was legally perilous.\nAlso, I think we can readily assume OpenAI understood that one of their potential voices sounded a lot like SJ. Since they were pursuing her they must have had a pretty good idea of what they were going after, especially considering the likely price tag. So even if an SJ voice wasn't the original goal, it clearly became an important goal to them. They surely listened to demos for many voice actors, auditioned a number of them, and may even have recorded many of them, but somehow they selected one for release who seemed to sound a lot like SJ.",

The article itself explains that there is significant legal risk here:\n> Mitch Glazier, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, said that Johansson may have a strong case against OpenAI if she brings forth a lawsuit.\n> He compared Johansson’s case to one brought by the singer Bette Midler against the Ford Motor Co. in the 1980s. Ford asked Midler to use her voice in ads. After she declined, Ford hired an impersonator. A U.S. appellate court ruled in Midler’s favor, indicating her voice was protected against unauthorized use.\n> But Mark Humphrey, a partner and intellectual property lawyer at Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, said any potential jury probably would have to assess whether Sky’s voice is identifiable as Johansson.\n> Several factors go against OpenAI, he said, namely Altman’s tweet and his outreach to Johansson in September and May. “It just begs the question: It’s like, if you use a different person, there was no intent for it to sound like Scarlett Johansson. Why are you reaching out to her two days before?” he said. “That would have to be explained.”\n* A.K.A. \"Personality rights\": https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights",

          "description": "Actually, it's the opposite. At the level of automation we've reached, labor is worth, per hour, way more than 100 years ago. The problem is just that this value is siphoned off by shareholders who do not have to work to receive the monetary value that should go to the worker. So the issue is simply in how corporations are set up and how the stock market is designed.\nThe entire system is designed to drain as much value out of hardworking people into the pockets of those who do not work, but simply own shares.\nBeing able to buy and sell shares is not problematic per se, but there should be rules in place that give all workers of a publicly traded company better access to owning parts of said company. In other words, all workers of a rich company should be (relatively spoken) rich, corresponding to the value they provided to the company.",

This is going to happen to everyone, as in, no person will be valuable enough via the contribution of their labor to survive without subsidies.\nAt the level of automation we've reached in society, low-skilled labor is worth, per hour, a very small amount.\nAs AI and automation improve, the majority of people will have negligible economic utility. The only way around this is to let those people starve or implement UBI. There is no magical future where AI serves as a democratizing \"labor enhancer\" for the masses. The value-add of some random person will be 0 in nearly all cases.\nWe will have to decouple our implicit assumption that a person's value is tied to their potential economic value.",

It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.\nJust do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - 'Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life'.\nThere is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the 'Just do the work' part easier with time. But you gotta get started.\nStart in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.",

Don't tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.\nFirst step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.\nLeveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.\nMinimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher.

If you don't have strong convictions you will find yourself going wherever the next opinionated and charismatic person you meet points you.  But it is important to choose them wisely.\nWhat if your conviction is that penguins can fly, they only need the right motivation? So you spend your life trying to give motivational speeches to penguins. Hoping one of them will fly. You will even meet people with similarly strong convictions. Form a strong community. Make derogatory memes about the 'others' who believe in things like the 'scientific method' and so on.\nAnd your ego attaches itself tightly to your penguin motivator persona. So anyone trying to challenge you is attacking you and your community. So you viciously attack this person back. Congratulations. You are now in a toxic pointless echo chamber.\nThe only solution is selecting convictions using first principles. Employ the scientific method. Be open to being challenged as long as the challenge comes through solid first principles thinking as well. All the while keeping the ego in check.\nSo in essence develop an egoless conviction. Be open to being challenged. Don't end up in pointless toxic echo chambers.",

Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress \"wisdom\" into a handful of tweets and blog posts.\nMost Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval's entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it's usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.\nSometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don't need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.",

If you think about it, it is a powerful term. It gives power to the player.\nApplied to life everything is a skill issue. Can't do the perfect juggle? Skill issue. Can't write awesome distributed performant code? Skill issue. Can't convince a penguin to try your awesome new ice cream? You guessed it. Skill issue. It is a powerful mindset. Gives you extreme ownership.\nBut there is a catch. Do you take ownership of other people's shitty behavior? No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don't need the negativity in your life.\nHere the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context. In a more personal context, things are a lot more messy. I don't have an answer for that which works. A skill issue on my end. Need more life experience to resolve it.\nMake everything a skill issue and just level up!",

I thought it'd be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.\nNext week I'm flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it'll be just me, in a new city. I'm excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I'm really on my own.\nI moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it's time for me to leave; I've been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I'm in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).\nIt's a big step, despite something I'm excited for. Yet very scary. But if I'm scared to do it, it's exactly because I'm scared that I should do it.\nI think I'm ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.\nThe (paper) journal I've kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It's as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.\nI'll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?",

I have over the years consumed a lot of content around productivity. It took me a long time to realise I was making a fundamental mistake.\nI assumed I would stumble upon some specific protocol that I can follow perfectly and my life is set. So I have tried it all. All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.\nThe fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.\nThis realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.\nHow to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming. I have given a framework I follow for this in my 'Hacking Hardwork' post.\nThere is no golden technique that will save you. Only you can save yourself.",

Or this attempt at a blog.\nIt's been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil' kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.\nA friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.\nI used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.\nAs of late, I've been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I've been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn't really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.\nThis built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.\nSo once again, here we go!\n1. As a note, the \"Fucktopia\" is a reference to Souillon's comic book \"Hello Fucktopia\". Couldn't find a listing in English, sorry! It's available in French & Spanish, at least..\nMy small rules of writing\nTry to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.\nFocus! I'm super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.\nNo stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let's keep this place as my comfy Internet place.\nLet's hope it goes well. And I hope you'll enjoy this blog and its topics.\nFan-art of Cyberpunk Bartender Action: VA-11 HALL-A, by rnna_7",
