          "description": "While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.",

          "description": "Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;\nThe 'chopsticks catch' was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.\nThe heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn't the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.\nThe detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.\nThe use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I'd guess there are even more 'views' than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.\nI can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their 'massive' Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in 'full reuse' mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.\nAgain, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y'all did good.",

          "description": "First off, the booster was going about 1250 km/h when it started its landing burn, it relied purely on drag to get it slowed down to that speed.\nGoing by the telemetry of the seconds before the landing burn and noting the speed vs time, it seems drag was around 40 m/s^2 when it was going at around 3000 km/h. Since drag depends on velocity squared though, it had reduced to just above 10 m/s^2 just before the engines lit at 1250 km/h, and so would quickly become negligible once the engines lit.\nGoing by Wikipedia, the Super Heavy[1] has 3400000 kg of fuel at launch, so 3% of that is about 102000 kg. For the landing burn, it used 13 Raptor v3 engines[2] to scrub speed. Each Raptor flows about 650 kg/s max, so 3% fuel is enough for about 12 seconds for the 13 engines.\nThe empty mass of the Super Heavy is about 275000 kg, so about 377000 kg before the landing burn with 3% fuel.\nUsing the sea-level vs vacuum performance of the Raptor v2 engines, one can estimate that each Raptor v3 produces about 2.45 NM of force at sea-level. So 13 of them would produce about 31.85 MN of force.\nUsing Newton's second law, F=ma, this gives an initial deceleration of about 84 m/s^2 and about 104 m/s^2 when empty. If we do a rough spreadsheet integration, we get that a burn of roughly 4 seconds is needed to scrub the speed assuming no other forces.\nNow, comparing this with reality, the full 13 engines were lit for a little over 5 seconds.\nIn my simplified calculations I was assuming full throttle the whole way, which obviously isn't realistic, and I also assumed 3% fuel. So over all I think that's a pretty decent estimation.\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Super_Heavy#Engines\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor",

The Shuttle was “reusable” because they needed a term between the default for transportation capital expenditures (e.g. trains, planes, cars and ships) and the modified missiles that defined post-War spaceflight. “Reusable” in the Shuttle’s context meant  months of specialist overhaul time and the cost of a Falcon 9 launch in SRB booster replacements alone [0].\nAt the end of the day, in 2010, “the incremental cost per flight of the Space Shuttle was $409 million, or $14,186 per kilogram” [1]. ($591mm and $20,512 in 2024 dollars, respectively [2].) SpaceX’s prices per kg are around $3,170 on Falcon 9 [3] and $1,520 for Falcon Heavy [4]. Starship should bring those costs below $1000.\n[0] https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=51959.0\n[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program\n[2] https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/\n[3] https://www.spacex.com/media/Capabilities&Services.pdf LEO\n[4] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy LEO, theoretical",

That's a good way to get people not to bother with your big bounty program. It is often better to build goodwill than to be a stickler for rules and technicalities.\nSide note: I'm not too surprised, as I had one of the worst experiences ever interviewing with Zendesk a few years back.

          "description": "I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.\nFor IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.\nI think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.\nThere is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.\nThis is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.",

I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I've kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I've started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.\nAll this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it's time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I'm forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.\nI say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I've had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don't know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.",

For sure Google wants adblock to die, but I think it goes even deeper than that.\nI think it's part of a much bigger trend in tech in general but also in Google:  Removing user control.  When you look at the \"security\" things they are doing, many of them have a common philosophy underpinning them that the user (aka device owner) is a security threat and must be protected against.  Web integrity, Manifest v3, various DoH/DoT, bootloader locking, device integrity which conveniently makes root difficult/impossible, and more.\nTo all the engineers working on this stuff, I hope you're happy that your work is essentially destroying the world that you and I grew up in.

I quickly gave up on that approach.\nThen I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting \"Windowed Projector (Preview)\", it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.\nWhatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.\nIt took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I'm very pleased with how well it works now.\n---\n[1] https://obsproject.com/\n[2] https://obsproject.com/kb/power-of-projectors",

I thought having a very interesting job would do it but this has not paid off as you might expect”\nThe first two people I thought of who give me the impression they enjoy their jobs are you and Bruno Dias, so I was wondering if you had an answer for this (because I sure don’t!)\nI was slightly taken aback by this, as one often is when one sees one's name in print unexpectedly, and I had to pick apart a little this idea that I give the impression that I enjoy my job.\nI certainly have talked very positively about my work in public; I believe most readers should be familiar with the old (but…",

Some of those goals included:\nFive years after earning my degree, I should be making a certain amount of money.\nBy 25, I should be engaged, and shortly after, should be married.\nBy a certain age, I should have a specific number of children.\nBefore that, I should own a particular kind of house in a specific location.\nAnd so on, and so on.\nLife is a fickle thing. I was young and didn’t fully grasp that wanting to achieve something by a certain time didn’t guarantee I would actually do it then.\nHaving a goal was good for me. During those 5 years, I worked really hard to reach a specific point in my career to hit that number. What was not helpful was being hard on myself and feeling like a failure when I didn’t meet those goal exactly when I thought I should have.\nThen I turned 25. I wasn’t engaged yet. Granted, by the time I was 25, I realized that I actually wasn’t even ready to be engaged to my partner then. We probably could have, but it wasn’t the right time. It would be a silly thing to get engaged because I had set this arbitrary number when I was young and I wanted to meet some sort of timeline. So we didn’t.\nAnyways.\nI had a longer list than what I listed above. As I grew older, and gained more life experience, I realized that timelines are toxic for me. I still want to achieve certain goals, but I no longer want to attach specific deadlines to them.\nI will reach those goals when the timing is right for me.\nI shouldn’t feel like a failure just because I didn’t adhere to an arbitrary timeline.\nAll in its own time.\n71/100\nReply by email",

We got the Mango Coco (whole mango with homemade coconut milk) and Mango Cloud (whole mango with cheese cloud).\n\nI mean... LOOK HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS! It was even more delicious than it looked.\n\nI thought it said milkshake but was then corrected after a closer look.\n\n\nWe got hungry after our bubble tea outing and decided to go to another place that sold more bubble tea. We didn't get any though. We decided to try their empanadas instead.\n\nKuboba Spot is yet another place with a 4.8 ⭐ rating on Yelp. Limited seating outside + street parking.\n\nFilipino Empanadas FTW. We got Embotido (pork meatloaf), Chicken Adobo, Cheeseburger (weekend special) and Kaldereta (Beef Stew).",

          "description": "Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I'm trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.\nIf you're reading this you're probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it's the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I'm trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.\nSimon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.\nI keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I've received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.\nKnowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board. He then wrote each of these messages out by hand (suffering only minor carpel tunnel) on sticky notes which the bear now carries like a human bear directional.\n\nIt now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.\nThese are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they've been listened to and understood. That don't cost much money but are priceless at the same time.\nI'm grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you're subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.\nEnjoyed the article? I write about 1-2 a month.

I know I don't have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I'll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.\nRubidium hasn't been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.\nBlogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it's far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.\nIt was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it.
