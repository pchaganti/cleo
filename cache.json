In addition, because “fascist” is an epithet as well as political term, it must be used carefully. In 1942, a New Hampshire Jehovah’s Witness named Chaplinsky was arrested after calling a Rochester city marshal a “damned fascist.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the arrest on the grounds that the expression constituted “fighting words,” excluded from constitutional protection. Recent court decisions in the U.S. have widened speech freedoms, but the word “fascist” remains highly charged, underlining the need for historical and political discretion.

Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.",

In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.",

You save a handful of bits at the expense of a lot of potential bugs. HTTP/1(.1) is mostly replaced by HTTP/2 and later by now anyway.\nSure, it makes sense not to require CRLF with any new protocols, but it doesn't seem worth updating legacy things.\n> Even if an established protocol (HTTP, SMTP, CSV, FTP) technically requires CRLF as a line ending, do not comply.\nI'm hoping this is satire.

          "description": "Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;\nThe 'chopsticks catch' was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.\nThe heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn't the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.\nThe detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.\nThe use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I'd guess there are even more 'views' than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.\nI can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their 'massive' Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in 'full reuse' mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.\nAgain, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y'all did good.",

If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO.\nSIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time.\nSSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same.

A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.\nFor IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.\nI think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.\nThere is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.\nThis is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.",

I've started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.\nAll this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it's time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I'm forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.\nI say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life.

I quickly gave up on that approach.\nThen I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting \"Windowed Projector (Preview)\", it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.\nWhatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.\nIt took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I'm very pleased with how well it works now.\n---\n[1] https://obsproject.com/\n[2] https://obsproject.com/kb/power-of-projectors",

          "description": "Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the \"break it up\" camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.\nAs for the rebuttal of \"bUt ThE gDp\", there's a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There's another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart's Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.\nIt's worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&T and Microsoft's own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.",

          "description": "My concern, and IMO what should be the overwhelming concern of the maintainers, is not the code that is being written, or the code that will be written, but all the code that has been written, and will never be touched again. A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.\nFor those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more 'serious', 'professional' language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain't that.",

          "description": "When I first heard the maxim that an intelligent person should be able to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time, I was naive to think it meant weighing them for pros and cons. Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.\nConcretely related to the topic, I've often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I'll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what's going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.\nMy goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?",

I open the Substack app, read a plethora of girlhood essays, and realize they no longer feel relatable.\nAfter watching ​His Three Daughters (a brilliant movie), I thought about my dad and the dynamics within my own family as he was dying. We all grew up with a different dad and experienced a different relationship with him, which seems so bizarre. I also thought about his clothes. Did his wife throw them all out? What about his deathbed pajamas? Are they hanging up at the Goodwill? He'd probably be very disappointed in me for not having a job right now. He'd call me lazy.\nstarted watching the new Marilyn Manson doc series. I don't know why I'm so surprised by what was revealed. Disappointed, disgusted, and pissed off to lose yet another musician/actor I like to the pits of shitty behavior.\nI wish there were more indie-print literary magazines.\nI've been watching a lot of Mina Le vids while eating dinner on my living room coffee table. (My kitchen table is overrun by my unfinished jigsaw puzzle atm)\nLife has felt a little shaky lately. I feel like I'm on the precipice of so much change: moving in with my boyfriend (?), finding/starting a new job, and living out of the city (can I be a country girl?)\nROLL.DIARY:\n\nsketchbook peek\n\nmaking marks\n\nmorning light\n\npretty fall foliage",

This phrase encapsulates a common frustration in modern application deployment, where developers often encounter inconsistencies between their local environments and those of their colleagues or production servers.\n\nFor instance, Dev A might run the application flawlessly on their PC, while Dev B struggles to replicate the same success, even with the exact same workflow and dependencies. These discrepancies, due to OS differences, software versions, or configurations, cause delays and increased troubleshooting.\nDocker\nDocker resolves this issue by offering a consistent environment via containers. By bundling the app and its dependencies, Docker ensures uniform execution across machines, eliminating the \"it works on my machine\" …",

          "description": "Introduction\nThe 2nd article of the series, we will be covering AWS free services.\nAWS\n\nHas the largest market share, AWS dominates cloud computing with their massive infrastructure and a myriad of service offerings. However the issue with AWS especially for the topic on this article which is about free services, I found AWS' not as interesting as Azure's.\nFor example: App Runner is AWS equivalent of Azure's App Services, however App Runner is not free!\nCompute - EC2\n\nHands down one of the best medium to practice SSH into a virtual server in the cloud. If you haven't done that before, you need to do at least once just to experience it. Basically it's like starting a fresh install of an OS (I recommend using Linux: Debian or Ubuntu) and from there you install the necessary runtime and dependencies for the app you're deploying.\nI highly recommmend EC2, though you need to carefully monitor its free quota because once you passed the quota limit then you'll start paying for the service.\nCompute - Lambda\n\nA quick summary:\nAWS Lambda is a tool that lets you run code without worrying about servers. It automatically handles scaling and runs your code when something happens, like a file being uploaded or a database change. Lambda only charges you for the time your code runs.\nIt easily connects with other AWS services, making it simple to build apps that scale and work well. The main idea of Lambda is that you can focus on writing code instead of managing servers.\nHowever I feel the need to setup Layers are a bit cumbersome and I quickly lost interest. It's supposed to be easy, but I found it to be a lot of hassle. If I want to deal with complexity, I would prefer to use EC2 instance instead!\nCompute - App Runner\n\nApp Runner == Azure's App Services. The difference: App Runner is not free while App Services is free. This article only covers free services.\nNote: I will be updating this post when I've tried more of AWS' services.",

          "description": "People really like to talk about writing, don't they? I don't personally mind it, in fact I like writing too, but it feels like every other post that is on the trending tab is about either blogging or writing or Bearblog.\nIt's quite barebones, and I wish it would be simpler to talk to bloggers. Not many blogs have a comments section, and if I want to talk about their post, I may have to email them or go onto a different social media platform to do so. I know I don't have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I'll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.\nRubidium hasn't been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.\nBlogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it's far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.\nIt was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it. Fame isn't an issue, and I like that.\netc",

I liked the idea of doing a semi-regular thought or artdump, and the idea of people wanting to tune into said dumps. But I always hesitated for two reasons.\nOne was that I didn't do anything on a schedule, and if I did do something regularly, I'd stop as soon as it became a task on my to-do list.1 And two was that I've developed a habit of wanting to escape my audience if I knew it was there – worse if I knew who was in it. The awareness made it difficult for me to write or draw or post freely, always thinking about how it would look and if it was good enough and if the people I knew were watching would be offended.\nRSS comes as a relief for the overly self-conscious me.

I've been experimenting with this \"behind the scenes\" for a few days, and now I have an even better understanding of what the right path is for the moment.\nThe blog will remain as it is.\nIt became very clear as soon as I started practicing the new idea. It felt forced, limited, cumbersome, and...boring.\nI began to ponder which text would fit on which blog. I considered which blog I should prioritize. And what would I do with things like the newsletter and guestbook?\nMore and more unanswered questions accumulated...\nEverything indicated that the best course of action would be to stay put for now. I had more or less decided when a text by Kev Quirk appeared in my feed: Why Have Multiple Blogs?\nThat settled it! The final piece fell into place.\nFor the time being, this blog will continue to cover everything from Swedish Fika and Cinnamon Buns to Blog Tattoos and Writing as Meditation.\nAll in one delightful mess.",

Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I've still been making music, but it's been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can't come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven't had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you've figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.\nI didn't fully realize it, but what I needed was a bre…",

          "description": "If you're a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.\nBut what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.\nStarting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.\nLet go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.\nBegin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.\nWhen the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an \"About\" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.\nStep by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.\nSoon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.\nCommunity echoes\nFW: Blog Like a Painter by Yordi\n(I am) the painter with dried up paint cans by Jedda\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Helen Chong\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Dominik\nBlog Like a Community by So...
