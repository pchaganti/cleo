As a former college teacher, one who witnessed the attacks on those who protested against the War in Vietnam and who studied the repression on campuses during the McCarthy period, I became so appalled at what was being done to our brave and courageous college students that I began to write letters to the leaders of what are, in reality, academic enterprises.

          "description": "The U.S. housing market has had a tumultuous few years. After falling to record lows during the pandemic, the average 30-year mortgage rate rapidly increased in 2022 and 2023 and now hovers near a two-decade high of 7.2 percent. For those that locked in a low mortgage rate prior to 2022, this steep increase has significantly increased the cost of moving, as taking out a mortgage at current rates would potentially increase their monthly housing payment by hundreds or thousands of dollars, even if the amount they borrowed remained unchanged. As shown by Ferreira et al. (2011), this lock-in effect has the potential to reduce geographic mobility and turnover in the housing market and has gained the attention of  Federal Reserve leaders. In this post, we utilize special questions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys to estimate the extent to which mortgage rate lock-in is suppressing U.S. household’s moving plans.",

The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.",

          "description": "As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. \nThe CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.",

While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.",

In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.",

The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.",

          "description": "A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.",

For\nexample, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the\nnetwork identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.\nOne Linux namespace that was left behind is the user\nnamespace. This\nnamespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we\nuse inside the container from the ones on the host.\nThis is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as \"root\": we\nare root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,\nbut our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can\ndo. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.\nA container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out\no…",

          "description": "Private equity is akin to toxic poison for everyone who isn't one of the (very few) general partners who bask in obscene amounts of scrooge-mcduck money.  Think of making a cool $30 million+ a quarter, per partner -- thanks real estate (and apparently, emergency medical services) \"investments\"!  This is a direct funnel to syphon money from the workers to the ruling class.  That's even more cash than the top brass at FAAGs make.\nHow can this phenomenon be reigned in and sorted in the medium to long-term?\nIt's a loss for everyone (99.9999%) except the miniscule quantity of winners (0.0001%, yes, that's 1 in 1,000,000 - there aren't that many large-scale P/E firms).  Housing owned by P/E couldn't be more soul sucking.  Scratch that, this applies to every case I'm aware of where P/E firms own a thing.\nAnecdote: Last month my dear old dog was suddenly very ill and I spent $12k on emergency surgery to save his sweet life.  No regrets, I'm grateful he was fixable.  But in the waiting room I did the conservative math for what the SAGE Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Redwood City, CA makes in a year (before the comparatively small overhead, tax-deductible expenses) and they are pulling in at least $30 million in this single location.  That's.. a lot, for many 20 total staff.  Also they charged me $500 for each follow-up visit, which is way more than my real life surgeon charged me earlier this year! (Even including insurance, he didn't charge much for the follow-ups to make sure I survived.)  Damn.\nFor the dog lovers out there: Doggo is alive and well, can maybe last another year or two we hope.\nBtw, who owns SAGE?  NVA, a P/E firm.\nhttps://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/sage-veterinary-centers...\nhttps://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-veterinary-...",

The idea is whenever an error is found in an AST node, the AST node is replaced with an \"error\" node. Any combination of an error node with another node is replaced with an error node. Error messages for error nodes are suppressed.\nIt works far better than attempting to repair the AST into some plausible state.\nIt's analogous to the propagation of NaN values in floating point code.",

The people or organizations making decisions to not protect pedestrians should be held liable for choosing to endanger pedestrians.\ntoo often, the response to a car running into a person or building is to either claim nothing can be done about it, or to blame the driver.  no protections from cars is seen as a road designer following best practices, and they've done their job acceptably well.  and that should be corrected.",

Arguing for DEI in an abstract sense is much easier than arguing for specific interventions.\nOn the other hand, this is the textbook example of a Motte-and-bailey fallacy, where the debater conflates two topics and then retreats to the safer position while hoping that the audience will accept it as an argument for the more difficult position.\nDEI statements have been quite unpopular as specific interventions, as noted in the article by the way that the majority of staff disagreed with them when polled privately. However, speaking out against them publicly was viewed as a very risky move and serious career mistake, so they slowly slipped into mainstream acceptance.\nIt’s interesting to see how they’re now quietly being removed from processes with as little attention as possible. Nobody wants to be known as the person who campaigned against them publicly, but I suspect there are a lot of people feeling relief in this case as they’re being quietly removed from the process.",

One which is presented to Western audiences and one which is presented to Middle-Eastern audiences. The media and articles are politically aligned in each region. Don't assume what you read in the US/UK/wherever is the same as over there.\nIn the case of Israel, the Middle-Eastern unit were literally showing videos demanding further uprising against Israel across the region directly from Hamas. Also the entire point of Al Jazeera was for Qatar to provide political influence through media, not as an unbiased news agency.\nIt's even banned in some Arab countries for being a security risk.\nWhy would you allow that to continue in your country?",

          "description": "\"and block its websites.\" So this keeps Israelis from reading Al Jazeera.\nNow that's new. Israel started Internet censorship in 2017.[1] Initially it was limited to \"terror group websites, online illegal gambling, prostitution services, hard drug sales\". At the time, \"due to warnings from rights groups that the law poses a slippery slope toward additional censorship, the final version of the legislation dictates that rights groups may appeal the decisions.\"\nThen, in 2021, there was the \"Facebook bill\", authorizing very broad censorship.[2] That does not seem to have passed. It was first proposed in 2016, almost passed in 2018 [3], tried in 2021, and tried again in 2022. It doesn't seem to have passed.\nBut something new happened recently. Wikipedia has a note at Censorship in Israel: \"This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: New ban issued by the knesset on foreign media channels. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2024)\"[4]\nThe Knesset gave the government the authority to ban foreign media on April 1, 2024.[5]\nThis isn't just about preventing outside media from reporting from Israel. It keeps Israelis from viewing media the government doesn't like. Haarez has good coverage.[6]\nThe US White House press secretary issued a weak statement condemning Israel's action, but it was on April 1st and the costumed Easter Bunny overshadowed that statement.[7]\n[1] https://www.timesofisrael.com/to-tackle-online-crime-israel-...\n[2] https://www.timesofisrael.com/proposed-censorship-bill-more-...\n[3] https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-israel-nearly-destroyed-fr...\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Israel\n[5] https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israels-knesset-approve...\n[6] https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-05/ty-article/is...\n[7] https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/202...",

They always seemed very \"1984\" to me, and almost designed to engender resentment in a way that would ultimately backfire. So perhaps I'm in a like-minded echo chamber, but is there anyone that actually defends these DEI statements with a coherent argument, or can you point me to one online? If so, I'd honestly love to hear it, and I mean this quite genuinely. I did some googling beforehand and found loads of \"how to write a good DEI statement\" articles, but literally every single one of them just took it at face value that these were a good thing to begin with (or, perhaps in their defense, that \"academic jobs require it\", so you better learn how to write one in any case).",

I noticed that they started lacking basic networking knowledge and couldn't set up networking inside AWS. They just didn't know what a gateway, NAT, or subnet is.\nSimilar things are happening with AI co-pilots. We have an increasing number of people who \"write code\", but the number of people who can understand and review code is not increasing. There is also a problem of injecting ethics and politics into those tools, which can produce silly results. I asked Bard to write me a Python function to turn the US Constitution into a palindrome. Bard refused and gave ma a lecture on how the US Constitution is too important to be played with in such trivial fashion. I then asked it to produce code that turns the US national anthem into a palindrome, it refused again. So I asked it do the same but with the Russian national anthem and it spat out code without telling me off. I then asked it to generate code for simple tasks and it did an OK job, except the formatting and the fonts used were different every time, because it just lifted code from different webpages and recombined it like a massively hungover student waking up to realise he's supposed to hand in the assignment in one hour.",

Everyone picked a course based on how lenient the grading was or interest.\nI respected the guy so decided to follow his advice. I chose 'Computational Complexity' as an elective. A subject I had no interest in. The Prof was known for strict grading and the material was supposed to be really tough. It was all theory. No practical coding. On paper it was the worst choice I could have made. It turned out to be the best course I ever took.\nIn my college you can sit for am elective course for first week or two before committing to it. Kind of like window shopping for knowledge. So I decided to check the course out. I knew nothing about it. Had no interest as well. It quickly changed. The Prof teaching it had a passion that was infectious. He would encourage doubts. If someone asked something silly he would say \"ah! it seems trivial on the face of it but reveals deeper complexities\" with a happy glint in his eyes. There were no stupid questions in his class. So I chose the teacher not the course. Going with my gut and my seniors advice against all common sense. Only 11 other people in the entire college took the course.\nI had the most fun in those classes. Learned so much. Fell in love with formal proof writing. Had my mind blown several times. The extra class hours spend absorbing the material, making my way through new proofs felt effortless.\nIt taught me a lesson that I always keep in mind. Environment matters. The people you surround yourself with matter. Whether in work or personal life. Anything can become interesting, profound and world changing if done with right people.",

Being ambitious means I want to achieve a lot, something that required hard work. Being lazy means, well I would rather not work hard.\nAnd no this is not some post about smart work. I never understood smart work anyways. It assumes people are dumb and don't know how to approach problems from high leverage points. I am not sure if any of these people even exist when you are competing at a high level.\nCompeting at a high level means you are up against smart crazy human beings willing to burn everything including themselves. You have to grind hard to have a shot. So I had to solve my hard work issue.\nI soon realised that my issue was not hard work. It was work that 'felt' like hard work. I can just program the wet squishy computer between my skull to change the 'feeling' settings. So hard work feels like a breeze. Even extremely enjoyable.\nHow can this programming be done? Well the key insight is you can bore yourself to a point that anything is enjoyable. Also you can gaslight yourself into making any mundane task feel grand. So what looks like mundane paperwork to someone on the outside could feel like the holy act of putting ink on paper and rewriting history to you. You get my point right?\nEveryone has a different brain and how you programme this squishy thing will be personal to you. Just spend time with yourself. Introspect to read the documentation.\nBe the cracked self programmer you need to be!",

          "description": "{{ post_description }}\nI thought that instead of typing up another rant, I'd do something a bit different. I want to share a little anecdote with you.\nAround 20 years ago, I joined the British Army; right at the height of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.\nYeah, I've never been the sharpest tool in the box.\nAnyway, Iraq was shit. I lost a couple of friends, more were badly hurt, and I myself suffered a minor shrapnel wound.\nIt's fair to say that I saw shit out there that no-one should ever see. I finished my tour of Iraq and less than a year later I found myself in Afghanistan.\nFor me, Afghan was marginally better than Iraq. I won't go into detail as to why as that could reveal who I am, but suffice to say, it wasn't quite as shit as Iraq.\nI got back from Afghan and I was fucked. Not physically though. Mentally. The Army might spin this yarn that they give their troops the help they need, but the fact of the matter is, if you went to the \"Med Centre\" claiming you were having mental health problems, you'd quickly become a laughing stock of the battalion.\nYou'd be labelled a pussy. A fanny. Not tough enough be a soldier.\nNote: This might not be the case anymore. It's been a long time since I served, but that's what it was like then I was serving.\nSo I didn't get help, and it utterly fucked me. I was having nightmares. I was taking it out on my loved ones. I was all over the show.\nThen my (now) wife convinced me to go see a professional to help me process some of this baggage.\nI did, and it really helped. Actually, it was one of the best things I've ever done. Do I still have demons? Yes. Do I let them affect my life? For the most part, no.\nSo, my message to you is - whether you're a soldier, a police officer, a fire fighter, a janitor, an office worker, or anything else - if you have shit going on upstairs, don't let it fester. Go and see someone about it. Someone impartial, who can just listen and help you process that shit.\nYou can thank me later.\nPeace. ✌️\nReply by email",

What the heck is going on?!\nAnd to think I gave Bearblog a try because I saw him blogging on here. Now he's packed up and moved on and left us all here.\nChecked out the other blogs/bloggers on this new platform. There was one guy that had 4-5 active blogs, on different platforms it seems. Dude, how are you even maintaining all of those.\nIf you told me before that I would get FOMO from following blogs, I will tell you you're crazy. But what is this I'm feeling now?
