          "description": "As unrest spreads, I think it’s worth looking at the weaknesses of American police forces in particular. Most of these vulnerabilities also apply to the National Guard.\nNon-violent protest has been the dogma, especially on the center-left, for generations now. It wasn’t always thus: old time unions fought pitched battles with police and in one case coal miners fought the military straight up. Blowing up buildings was not verboten, nor was assassination. The history of America is not what pansy-moderns think it is, and the same is true of Britain and Canada and so on. Our forbears did not think that letting the state beat you, shoot you, torture you, imprison you and kill you without fighting back was either virtuous or, in many cases, smart.\nModern Americans, increasingly impoverished (ave…",

That was an easy, obvious prediction based on the fact that Russia is larger and has more industry and that China would not allow sanctions to take out Russia, knowing it would be next, but would keep the Russian economy running.\nThis prediction is a little more risky because the war could end due to a peace deal. There’s no question that Ukraine is losing, and that the battlefield is getting worse and worse for them.\n\nRussian forced are back within 300 kilometers of Kiev. While advances are slow, they are speeding up. The Ukrainians are running out of manpower, considering mobilizing women for infantry, and have huge problems with desertion and recruitment.

          "description": "What a lot of people don’t know is that the aid ship Greta was on wasn’t the first ship sent. The last one didn’t get to Israel either, but since there were no major celebrities on it, most people who aren’t 24/7 news or Gaza obsessives don’t know it even existed.\nThis aid ship was never expected to be able to deliver food and medical supplies. Everyone knew Israel would stop it. It was meant to highlight the fact that Israel is has created a deliberate famine in Gaza.\nBecause Greta, in particular, was there, it succeeded. That was her job. She wasn’t required to die, or to wind up in prison, though both were possible, she’s just a lightning rod. I’ve seen at least half a dozen op-eds, most of them negative, about Greta and the relief ship.\nBut negative is fine. Neolibs and right wingers love to hate Greta. They can’t shut up and not talk about her, which is what they should have done. Instead they have to take their potshots, and so far more people know that a ship full of food was hijacked in international waters and that Israel is starving Palestinians to death.\nCelebrities, and Greta is a celebrity, have one main job when it comes to whatever causes they champion: to get press. That’s what Greta did and good for her.\nAs for all the haters, well, Greta’s right that genocide is bad, and she’s right about the environment, so hating her most likely means someone wants mass death, or that they’re stupid and think environmental issues aren’t real.\n***\nIf you’ve read this far, and you read a lot of my articles, you might wish to donate or subscribe. I’ve written over 3,500 posts, and the site, and Ian, take money to run.",

This isn’t about deportation, as such.\nWhat it is about is Gestapo tactics: sending people to torture prisons without due process; wearing masks and refusing to show badges or warrants; giving ICE the right to create its own warrants without judicial oversight (clearly unconstitutional); seizing people who are showing up for meetings at immigration facilities or immigrant courts.\nIt’s not what Trump is doing, it’s how he’s doing it—in the cruelest, most lawless and un…",
