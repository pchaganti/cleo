          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins?

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.",

The level of and availability of Windows workload\nsupport has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by\nlarge enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes\nand new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test\nWindows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.\nThe Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a\nclosed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention\nof offering Windows.…",

It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a\nprocess, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the\nkernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles\nOperator solve that problem by\nrunning as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that\ndistribution could be done by the container\nruntime.\nRuntimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:\na…",

One of our worst headaches was making these really powerful codebases work on desktop, web, mobile, and the cloud without having to completely rewrite them.  For example, to get Lightroom and Photoshop working on the web we took a winding path through JavaScript, Google’s PNaCl, asm.js, and finally WebAssembly, all while having to rethink our GPU architecture around these devices. We even had to get single-threaded builds working and rebuild the UI around Web Components. Today the web builds work great, but it was a decade-long journey to get there!\nThe graphics stack continues to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in portability.
