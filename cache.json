          "description": "When I talk about the environment I usually say “Climate change & Environmental Degradation.” It’s important to understand that while these two reinforce each other, they aren’t the same thing.\nA UK-wide decline in bug splats recorded on car number plates indicates an “alarming” fall in the number of flying insects, UK scientists said in a survey published yesterday.\nThe 2024 Bugs Matter report revealed the numbers of flying insects found stuck to vehicle number plates had dropped by nearly 63 per cent since 2021.\n\nThis study from Germany in 2017 found a:\nMore than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas\nAnd there were decreases in the 1900s as well. Bug biodiversity and biomass is WAY down. Here’s a lovely chart from 2019.\n\nWe’re seeing this sort of crash, in both biodiversity and biomass for all sorts of species, not just bugs. Problem is that our food production and a pile of environmental processes related to water and atmosphere renewal are dependent on animals and plants. There’s massive loss of plankton, mammals, reptiles, bacteria in our soil and so on.\nThis stuff isn’t independent of climate change, but even without any climate change there’d still be plenty of it. The loss of wild areas, plus tons of pollution and the side effects of extraction and energy generation are largely to blame.\nCollapse of this “web of life” or “food web” is a huge danger to us, as well as being a monstrous crime against other forms of life.\nSo don’t think “climate change is it”. It isn’t, and it may not even be as important as loss of biodiversity.\n \nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

          "description": "Long term readers will know that I’ve been negative on Britain for a long time. Corbyn was their last chance to turn things around, but Corbyn lacked the necessary ruthlessness to win, and was destroyed by absolutely bullshit allegations of anti-semitism. Starmer became Labour leader after him, on promises of left wing policies which even a child should have disbelieved, and ruthlessly purged Labour of all left wingers.\nConservatives ran stupid governments with horrid policies which led to inflation and continued de-industrialization, and Starmer backed into power.  His policies are worse than the Conservatives, with draconian cuts to social welfare policies like child support, heat for old people, and wheelchairs for cripples.

Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada is seen during the Session ‘The Global Economic Outlook’ at the Annual Meeting 2013 of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 26, 2013.\nCopyright by World Economic Forum\nswiss-image.ch/Photo Moritz Hager\n\nCarney has won a minority government. He will have to govern with the support of the NDP. The NDP was slaughtered in this election, and there were a few ridings where people strategically voting for the Liberals actually led to the Conservatives winning. And, it’s worth pointing out that the Conservatives increased their seat count, which is why Poilievre is sticking around as leader, despite losing the election and his own seat.
