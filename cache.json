These tragedies are a direct consequence of Israel’s illegal, U.S.-backed occupation of Palestinian territory and its war on Gaza, which must both end immediately. From the mass killing and maiming of Palestinian civilians to the forced starvation and deliberate destruction of Gaza’s health infrastructure, Palestinians and international experts have warned from the start that Israel is committing a “textbook case of genocide” in Gaza.

          "description": "After a year of watching thousands of people suffer a genocide fueled in large part by U.S. dollars and technology, the usual order of life on university campuses has been upended. Students, staff and faculty have protested, picketed, rallied, and exercised a long tradition of “expressive activity” that has come to define the unique space that inhabits university life. To say that this is a novel upsurge would be to ignore the student mobilizations throughout the years, against the massacres in Vietnam, apartheid in South Africa, and racisms past and present in our backyard. Each of these struggles have become part of the glossy photos memorializing universities’ nostalgic past, and seeming proof of their reputations as bastions of free expression, even in the face of government oppression.

          "description": "While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.",

Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.",

          "description": "Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the \"break it up\" camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.\nAs for the rebuttal of \"bUt ThE gDp\", there's a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There's another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart's Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.\nIt's worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&T and Microsoft's own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.",

A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.\nFor those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more 'serious', 'professional' language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain't that.",

Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.\nConcretely related to the topic, I've often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I'll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what's going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.\nMy goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines.

          "description": "In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it's 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail.\nIt's my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren't operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn't be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.)\nLot of preamble to say: no, I don't think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.",

If we're not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?\nNever the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I've been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5's, 7's, and 8's that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.\nBut tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I've been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It's as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!\nAnd pick up a new hobby if you are able.

I also like to make things in Rust…\nI think this part is perhaps the silliest part of a very silly article. If you really like to put in a minimal effort then why on earth would you use Rust? If you want efficiency, memory management and a compiled modern language just use Go. Then you won’t even need anything but the standard library for what you want to do. Or… use Django as you suggest?\nYes, yes we use Rust in production because we thought it would be easier (well safer) to teach to interpreted language OOP developers than c/c++ but why on earth would you ever use it for the web unless you are a member of the cult?",

Often, important products like fire extinguishers and smoke alarms are missing.\nIf the customer is missing something and wants to purchase it, I have those kinds of products in my car. The sales are secondary, as a service to the customer, but I'm usually one of the technicians who sells the most.\nDo I get a good commission for that effort? No. Do I work my butt off to be at the top? Never. Are our products the cheapest? Nope.\nThe simple reason is that I enjoy doing it. It's a great feeling to leave a home safer than when I arrived. It feels satisfying and rewarding.\nIf I saw myself as a salesperson or recommended something I didn't believe in, I could just as well drive around with an empty car. I wouldn't sell a single product.\nThe same goes for my blog. I write about blogging because it interests and fascinates me. If I were to write about something just to be trendy or try to get more people to read my stuff, I'd get bored real fast. And my readers would too.\nRegardless of what your goal is with your blog (if you have one), make sure it's something you're passionate about.

          "description": "Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.\n\nThe main problem with Blogs in 1997 is that it didn't take long to realize nobody else cared about it.\nThe good thing about Blogs in 2024 is that you go into it knowing nobody will care about it. How Fucking Refreshing.\nThese days there are places to connect in 300 characters or less, places to manage & moderate a growing community, and there are billionaire owned communities to help you become disappointed in your friends and family.\nSounds tedious AF.\nI miss the ancient times when a simple RSS reader allowed people to lurk in the manner they preferred.\nWhen an introvert could get a word in.\nWhen you could fucking curse if it pleased you, because you're an adult and sometimes things suck.\nYa know?!?\nSo that's what I'll do here.\nCurse.\nBut also share. With no pressure to be heard. And no pressure to respond.\nIf nothing else, a time capsule.\nOf my journey in game development, and perhaps someday in setting up a studio. Video games have always been a wonderful escape for me. I'd call my game studio \"Escape Element\". So that'll be the blog's name too.\nBut don't be confused. This blog will be my personal take on things.\nYou could find all sorts of stuff here. It could be gamedev related stuff like art, music, or code (I dabble in all) ... or...\nI may just need to rant about how stupid people are stupid.\nWhatever is taking my attention at any given moment... I'm probably either in love with or pissed off at it, and it's well past time I let the universe know about it.\nIf following along sounds like it may provide you with an element of escape, come on back.",

Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.\nBut what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.\nStarting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.\nLet go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.\nBegin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.\nWhen the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an \"About\" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.\nStep by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.\nSoon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.\nCommunity echoes\nFW: Blog Like a Painter by Yordi\n(I am) the painter with dried up paint cans by Jedda\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Helen Chong\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Dominik",

          "description": "I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.\nOne guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.\nWriting forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.\nOf course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).\nOne annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.\nOn the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.\nWhile I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)\nP.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?",

Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don't know what to write about. My answer is always the same:\n\"Blog your way to the answer.\"\nWe can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.\nBlog, blog, blog – that's the solution.\nWe might come to realize that we don't need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.\nOr maybe we'll realize that blogging isn't our thing at all. Then at least we've tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn't waste our time ruminating about it.\nThe only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It's still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.\nMany of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I'm really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog's small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.\nWho knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don't have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:\nThrough blogging.

Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I'll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I'll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I've really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don't always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.\nWhen I post something in the morning, I'll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don't have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it's a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I've also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me.

The meditation I practice is called writing.\nFew things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I've tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.\nAm I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the \"technique\" isn't so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.\nIf meditation becomes something that \"should be done\" - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task 'meditation' on the to-do list.\nI leave you with that to meditate on.",

I have expressed it on several occasions in France, and the present events, unfortunately, only reinforce it.

The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. \n The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…",

While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…",

I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. \n Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…",
