And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.\nIt can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits.

Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy.

It's rather humbling.\nCollaborating with nontechnical people is oddly my favorite part of doing MLE work right now. It wasn't the case when I did basic web/db stuff. They see me as a magician. I see them as voodoo priests and priestesses. When we get something trained up and forecasting that we both like, it's super fulfilling. I think for both sides.\nMost of my modeling is healthcare related. I tease insights out of a monstrous data lake of claims, Rx, doctor notes, vital signs, diagnostic imagery, etc. What is also monstrous is how accessible this information is. HIPAA my left foot.\nSince you seemed to be asking about the temporal realities, it's about 3 hours of meetings a week, probably another 3 doing task grooming/preparatory stuff, fixing some ETL problem, or doing a one-off query for the business, the rest is swimming around in the data trying to find a slight edge to forecast something that surprised us for a $million or two using our historical snapshots. It's like playing wheres waldo with math. And the waldo scene ends up being about 50TB or so in size. :D",

I installed Windows for personal use for the first time recently (although I use it exclusively at work) and it drove me ABSOLUTELY BONKERS that my home drive was mapping to C:\\Users\\atribecalledqst\\OneDrive.\nWhat I hated the most was that the File Explorer just calls the folders in there e.g. \"Documents\" and \"Pictures\" without showing the full path. So it was hard to figure out just where in the file system you were looking -- a major annoyance if you do any work in the command-line!\nEven after switching OneDrive off and doing as much as I can to try and get rid of the OneDrive folder structure, I haven't been completely successful. You can make some -- but not all -- home folders (like Downloads, Documents, etc.) point directly to their place in the local user folder, but others, particularly Pictures, don't seem to be movable. Additionally, some programs still seem to want to use the OneDrive folder by default, like I think Office programs still do their best to use them.\nIn the grand scheme of things it's a small annoyance but god it annoys the shit out of me! I didn't ask for cloud backup and it drives me nuts they tried to force it on me!",

          "description": "Having written an SSH server that is used in a few larger places, I find the perspective of enabling these features on a per-address basis by default in the future troubling. First, with IPv4 this will have the potential to increasingly penalize innocent bystanders as CGNs are deployed. Worst case, this will give bad actors the option to lock the original owner out of their own server if they have a botnet host in the same network. With IPv6 on the other hand, it is trivially easy to get a new IP, so the protection method described here will be completely ineffective.\nFrom my experiments with several honeypots over a longer period of time, most of these attacks are dumb dictionary attacks. Unless you are using default everything (user, port, password), these attacks don't represent a significant threat and more targeted attacks won't be caught by this. (Please use SSH keys.)\nI have seen experienced sysadmins create the test user with the password of \"test\" on a live server on port 22 because they were having an \"autopilot moment\". It got hacked within 20 minutes of going online and these mechanisms wouldn't have saved it, the attacker got in on the second or third try.\nIf you want to have a read about unsolved problems around SSH that should be addressed, Tatu Ylonen (the inventor of SSH) has written a paper about it in 2019: https://helda.helsinki.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/471f0ff...",

Otherwise, the model is a standard autoregressive GPT. The consequences of this seemingly \"simple\" modification are significant:\n* The authors can prompt the trained model with part of a sequence and then decode the missing tokens, all at once, in parallel, regardless of order -- i.e., the model can in-fill in parallel.\n* The authors can compute conditional probability densities for every missing token in a sequence, again in parallel, i.e., densities for all missing tokens at once.\n* The authors propose a rejection-sampling method for generating in-fill tokens, again in parallel. Their method seems to work well in practice.\nI've added this to my reading list. Thank you for sharing it on HN.",

Before he could get started on the remodel, someone broke in to the empty house, changed the locks, and started occupying it.\nI remember being shocked that someone could do this and be protected under the law. He had to follow a formal eviction process, even though they broke into his house and never had any agreement. The perpetrators were known to the police as professional squatters and they advised him on all the things to avoid doing so they wouldn’t countersue him, which was mind blowing.\nEven weirder was to watch the reaction on his social media when he posted the story. A lot of people, including many of his friends, jumped to defending squatter’s rights or trying to make some broader point about inequality.\nThere’s something about squatting that appeals to people who think it’s always a RobinHood situation: Stealing from the rich, giving to the poor. It’s more fun to imagine these people as noble warriors against an unjust society, rather than seem them as people abusing the laws for personal gain at the expense of random victims. Even here on HN there are comments trying to downplay the issue by portraying the victims as mostly wealthy or landlords, which are presumably acceptable victims to people who like these kind of narratives.",

          "description": "I think there are qualitative differences that arise from incremental, quantitative changes in privacy.\nSure, in the 1970s the cops could follow you around any time you were out in public. But they needed 6+ cops to provide round-the-clock surveillance, with an annual cost in the high six figures.\nSo the average citizen's privacy was protected not by law or high-minded ideals about privacy, but by simple numbers. There weren't enough cops to follow even 0.1% of the population.\nBut in the modern age of smartphones and license plate recognition and credit reference agencies? I think there's a strong argument to be made that we need new laws and new rights to reflect the new reality, where tracking people around the clock is several orders of magnitude cheaper.",

We're going to have lines of spectators into the space coast like we did for the shuttle.\nIf any of you are heading to Disney World you should stop by the NASA Kennedy Visitor Complex, it is so well done and not that expensive (it takes less time than 1 line at Disney world to get to :) ). It has the original launch control room for Apollo that you can tour, a Saturn V rocket that is laid horizontally and you can walk under, the crew module for the moon landing.  My favorite part is the Atlantis shuttle suspended from the ceiling, they left it in its \"raw\" landed format with scorch marks and tiles, it looks absolutely amazing.",

          "description": "Minutes before I left home on Thursday one of my mom's coworkers pulled up on the driveway and handed me a plastic bag of zongzi as a going away gift. \"Good luck with the move!\" he said. \"Go do what you love.\"\nThat last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.\nA large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?\nIn Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that \"looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.\" I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I'm not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I'm nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I'm doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.",

          "description": "Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?\nWeekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.\nBy the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.\nIt's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.\nWhere is that petition for the 4-day work week?\nThis weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

I’ve written a separate post about it: The basic feature blogging platforms lack. 🔎\nWell, it looks like things are about to change for us Bear bloggers. I just noticed that Herman's blog now has such a feature (can’t recall having seen it before). And it works elegantly. 🤩\nLet's hope this is something we'll all have soon. Thank you in advance, Herman! ✌️\nUpdate: Bear user Yordi made it possible to add your own (example). You can get yours here. Thank you, Yordi! 😎\nUpdate 2: The search results only include links to posts where the search word is included in the title. Hopefully there will come a “true search feature” in the future.",

I'm not used to it, like a river fish dumped in a tank. Everyone's dressed up in skin and mascara and waiting to go to the clubs and even though that life is not for me I love soaking in their anticipation on the subway platforms. Back when I worked abroad in that job I hated I remember writing something about how my soul left my body on Monday mornings and returned on Friday nights. I don't miss that feeling one bit, but I do sometimes think about that hunger for life I felt on Friday evenings, that burning desire to avenge the week of my life I sold to live for two days.

          "description": "I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:\nI feel like my life started after I turned 50. It's so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.\nHe says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels \"less serious\".\nI turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.\nI don't worry so much about what people think of me. It's not that I don't care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I've come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.\nYou can't please them all – and that's fine!\nIn many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…\nBut that doesn’t feel very important.\nThe lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It's more fun and interesting to live.\nNo matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.\nWant more “proof”?

          "description": "Well, hello there.\nI went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.\nWell, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.\nSo, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.\nIf you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.\nUntil then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited.
