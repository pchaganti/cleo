Even as some governments claim to have halted transfers or to not be sending weapons at all, they continue to provide licences or parts and components that are instrumental to the continuing onslaught. As people are now being pulled from the rubble in Rafah, in a strip of land already known as the world’s “largest open-air prison,” in a country and people bordered and confined by a violent settler colonial state, the relationships between the profiteers of the military-industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the border industrial complex come starkly into focus. And in the demands of the student encampments, the connections of these structures of state violence to universities becomes clear as well.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Divest from Death appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

In terms of actually holding climate polluters accountable, other than Biden’s budgetary proposal to end tax breaks (which is, after all, only a proposal), and a pause on natural gas permits, Democratic challenges have come in the form of “homework assignments for companies, and requests for Justice Department investigations,” wrote Axios reporter Ben German.

          "description": "Global central banks and finance ministries held nearly $12 trillion of foreign exchange reserves as of the end of 2023, with nearly $7 trillion composed of U.S. dollar assets. Nevertheless, a narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system. Some market participants have similarly linked the apparent increase in official demand for gold in recent years to a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.",

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.",

In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.\nHe replies:\nYes, it is. I can panic if I'm not allowed to write.\nI think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.\nIf I don't write in one form or another, it's like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn't matter. Just get it out of the system.\nI think it was Stephen King who said something like:\n\"If you don't have time to read, how will you have time to write?”\nFor me, it's the other way around. If I don't write, there's no way I can be fully present and absorb what I'm reading.\nWriting is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.\nFollow: email · rss",

If you're on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!\nFor me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.\nWhen I say \"forever,\" I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it's a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere.

          "description": "One of the iron laws of people being creative on the internet is that it’s only a matter of time until the haters arrive.\nYesterday on Twitter, I saw post after post mocking the increasing popularity of bearblog, the “bear”-bones blogging platform that simply gives people a blank slate and lets them go at it. One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. \"Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...\"\nTo the contrary - I'm loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.\nIn this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest. Amidst it all, bearblog stands tall as a quiet, \"old-internet\" venue -- a corner of the web well worth preserving.",

Who determines what makes someone \"mediocre\" or an \"A+\"? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed \"mediocre\" is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.\nExcellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don't just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of \"A+ folks.\" The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.\nPerhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...\n and I've all fallen for the bait.",

The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.\nDuring these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.\n\"Dump it\" is a self-discovery journey where I try to turn months of introspection and café conversations into concise paragraphs, backed by research.",
