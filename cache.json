In addition, because “fascist” is an epithet as well as political term, it must be used carefully. In 1942, a New Hampshire Jehovah’s Witness named Chaplinsky was arrested after calling a Rochester city marshal a “damned fascist.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the arrest on the grounds that the expression constituted “fighting words,” excluded from constitutional protection. Recent court decisions in the U.S. have widened speech freedoms, but the word “fascist” remains highly charged, underlining the need for historical and political discretion.

          "description": "While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.",

In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.",

          "description": "I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.\nFor IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.\nI think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.\nThere is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.\nThis is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.",

I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I've kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I've started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.\nAll this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it's time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I'm forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.\nI say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I've had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don't know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.",

I quickly gave up on that approach.\nThen I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting \"Windowed Projector (Preview)\", it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.\nWhatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.\nIt took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I'm very pleased with how well it works now.\n---\n[1] https://obsproject.com/\n[2] https://obsproject.com/kb/power-of-projectors",

After all, it is their job. They are incentivized to keep making it more complex.\nThe first time I ever used C# was probably version 5? Maybe? We're on version 12 now and there's so much stuff in there that sometimes modern C# code from experts looks unreadable to me.\nOne of the reasons I have so much fun working in node/Javascript these days is because it is simple and not much has changed in express/node/etc for a long time. If I need an iterable that I can simply move through, I just do `let items = [];`. It is so easy and hasn't changed for so many years. I worry that we eventually come out with a dozen ways to do an array and modern code becomes much more challenging to read.\nWhen Typescript first came out, it was great. Types in Javascript are something we've always wanted. Now, Typescript is on version 5.6 and there is so much stuff you can do with it that it's overwhelming. And nobody uses most of it!\nThis is probably just old man ranting, but I think there's something there. The old version I used to debate about was C vs C++.

There's another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart's Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.\nIt's worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&T and Microsoft's own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.",

A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.\nFor those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more 'serious', 'professional' language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain't that.",

          "description": "When I first heard the maxim that an intelligent person should be able to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time, I was naive to think it meant weighing them for pros and cons. Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.\nConcretely related to the topic, I've often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I'll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what's going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.\nMy goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?",

Wanderers in the wilderness glimpse remnants of the Sun Guard’s emblem carved on ancient stones, the Queen’s face engraved on old metal coins. Little is remembered of what caused the Realm to fail. Harpists sing of a dying Queen seeking the cup of Solace. Others gossip of jealous lovers or sibling strife. What is known is in the last Age, the Sun Guard sallied forth from their Rotunda in the Queen’s Halls in Baelfyre, their eyes yearning for the City’s gleam. They were never seen again\nThey are lost and dispersed, withering in forgotten groves or rotting in hollows. There are rumors that their ancient hall still stands.\nIn these latter days of the fallen queen’s realm, peace extends no farther than a hold’s torchlight. The Forest and Wilderness cast long shadows. The Vale is a remote realm carved out with warrior’s blood on the edge of the empire across the Sea. There is word that lawlessness reigns, with roving warbands terrorizing the countryside and strange mystics shouting apocalyptic prophecies. Nature reclaims the queen’s road. craven opportunists find easy avenues to power\n\nFor the Players\nYou are hedge knights, come to this Land seeking opportunity, your knighthoods fresh as morning dew. You are the children of spring. Your new arms shine in the midday sun. You came to your knighthoods over the long cold winter, called to serve by the Seers and sworn to your oaths.\nDespite whatever burgeoning relationships (good or ill) you may have, you are a Company, newly formed of foreigners sent to a land unseen by your fathers.",

For those who don't know, Mastodon is a platform where you can have (in my case) micro-blog posts of 500 words or less, as well as share photos. People can comment on what you wrote or repost it. They can also give you a little dopamine boost by clicking a star to indicate they liked what you posted. In that way, it is structured similarly to Twitter (X), Threads, and BlueSky.\nWhere Twitter and Threads are corporate-owned and centralized, Mastodon is just a platform, and anyone can get the software and set up their own server if they are tech-savvy. It can be confusing for newcomers to decide which server they want to join, but the good news is that you can join more than one, and you can also mov…",

These changes consisted of banning four cards from the format: Dockside Extortionist, Jeweled Lotus, Mana Crypt, and Nadu, Winged Wisdom.\nLess than a week later, the Commander RC – the independent group of fans who had controlled the game’s most popular format for over a decade – was no more.\nWhat follows is an attempt at understanding how the world's most popular card game got to this point.\nA brief explanation of Commander\nIf you're unfamiliar: Commander is a casual Magic variant that has, in the last 10 years, become the most popular and widespread form of the game.

You've probably heard it too.\n\"You should try to write at least a little bit of music every day.\"\nThis is bad advice.\nFor a multitude of reasons that I won't get into here, I've had a terrible few months. Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I've still been making music, but it's been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can't come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven't had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you've figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.\nI didn't fully realize it, but what I needed was a bre…",

          "description": "If you're a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.\nBut what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.\nStarting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.\nLet go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.\nBegin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.\nWhen the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an \"About\" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.\nStep by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.\nSoon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.\nCommunity echoes\nFW: Blog Like a Painter by Yordi\n(I am) the painter with dried up paint cans by Jedda\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Helen Chong\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Dominik\nBlog Like a Community by So...

          "description": "I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.\nOne guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.\nWriting forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.\nOf course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).\nOne annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.\nOn the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.\nWhile I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)\nP.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?",
