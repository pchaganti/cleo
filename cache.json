          "description": "Image by Evgeniy Smersh.\nAny rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post A Punk Rock Paean appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

We explore this question in this post, based on a recent working paper.",

While the\nproject has been designed to fulfill microservice architectures in the past,\nit’s now time to listen to the end users and introduce features which have a\nstronger focus on AI/ML.\nOne of these requirements is to support Open Container Initiative (OCI)\ncompatible images and artifacts (referred as OCI objects) directly as a native\nvolume source. This allows users to focus on OCI standards as well as enables\nthem to store and distribute any content using OCI registries.

This enhancement\nhelps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between\ndifferent phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.\nFor a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a\n.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of\nwhen the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume\nis updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.\nWhat changed?\nThe API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the\ncurrent timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will\nbe overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.\nFor more details, read about\nPhase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

Sometimes we forget that software ought to be useful, not hypothetical ideals of truth. Just implement the feature for those codecs that support it and which probably are in the 98% percentile of what users actually use, regardless of the damned \"general case\".\nOr accept and announce shamelessly that you don't have either the knowledge or the development resources to tackle such a complex feature. But excuses about not being possible for absolutely every possible codec in a completely generic way is just denying that the world is just a chaotic and dirty place where things are not ideal nor perfect. Just give your users a real-world solution (or rejection).",

That doesn't mean popular, it doesn't necessarily mean best-in-class, but it means that there shouldn't be just one entity backing a project.\n- Membership in Apache is _personal_ not a seat for a given company. If you're a committer on an Apache project and you move jobs, you're _still_ a committer on that project\n- The Foundation owns the trademarks. There have been fights about this in the past, but the whole idea is that the _community_ owns the name, so some corporation can't claim to be the sole or official owner by naming their company or product after the open source product.\nThe core premise of the Apache Software Foundation is community over code, that healthy, diverse communities have a better chance of standing the test of time than open source projects backed by a single individual or company. That's the thesis at least.\nThe is starkly different from several other foundations, notably the Linux Foundation or Eclipse Foundation which are modeled more around industry consortiums.\nBoth models have their place, but I believe Apache better models the core values many of us feel strongly about when it comes to free and open source software.",

But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it's quite expensive, \"contact us\" salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor.\nThe Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there's was a way to walk back from it. But now there's no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition.\nI think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes?\nI wish them the best, they're a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause.\nGetting in bed with a single vendor for an incredibly sticky tool comes with a _lot_ of risk.

          "description": "I was once involved in a similar (unintentional) experiment with a multi-billion dollar defence radar.  A several metres deep underground bunker, containing several 19\" racks full of electrical/electronic gear, filled to ground level with a combination of mineralised surface water and mud during a storm.\nWhat we wanted to do was cut the power, pump the water out of the bunker ASAP and immediately clean the whole lot with pure water.\nWhat the (arse-covering) site manager did was nothing, not even cut the power, until a \"risk-assessment\" had been done.  For the first few days we were able to peer into the bunker's hatch and watch der blinkenlights happily operating in the gloom underwater.  That stopped after a few days.  About a week later the risk had been assessed and a path of action determined: the power was turned off, the water was pumped out and everything was washed with pure water.  By then electrolysis had dissolved just about every conductor in the system.\nElectrical systems will happily cope with water in the short term, but the longer the exposure the less likely they are to survive.  Time is part of the risk.",

Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you're watching right now.\nAnother thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called \"SoundFixer\" that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it's super distracting), but it doesn't seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they're embedded. I don't know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It's probably too niche and hard to do though.\nAlso I don't seem to find any volume control except mute?",

But as we get more data the opposite is happening: the numbers are diverging and their error bars are shrinking such that they no longer overlap.\nThis tells us that either our model of the universe is wrong (therefore the cosmic microwave background method is giving us an incorrect answer) or that something is wrong with how we're calculating the distances along the cosmic distance ladder. The latter was originally the assumption that should be proven true with more and better data from newer telescopes.

It might not be the most healthy thing to do, but I try to distract myself from these feelings by immersing myself in my work, hobbies, or playing video games with friends. This doesn't always help, but it does keep my mind off of it, at least for a short time.\nIt does get overwhelming sometimes dealing with all this by myself. I don't really have anyone in my life to speak about these things, so I have elected to scream these thoughts into the void that is my blog. I rarely, if at all, feel comfortable enough to talk about my feelings with friends or family because I was raised in a culture where that was not common or tolerated.\nThis might all sound hopeless, but I know that this will soon pass and that these feelings are temporary. All I have to do is ride out the waves.\n17/31",

It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.\nSounds wonderful!\nFor me, it’s the opposite. When I write on my phone, I stop and “overthink” things. I lose the flow I crave, just letting the thoughts flow onto the page. That’s why I can’t write in English either. It becomes awkwardly stilted.\nI've tried a bunch of different ways to write, and I've figured out that writing in Swedish first is the way to go for me. I usually type it up on my computer, using TextEdit in full-screen, and then translate it. After that, I go through the text and edit some parts here and there.\nIt might sound like a lot of extra work, but I've actually grown to enjoy the process. It’s fun, interesting, and I'm learning a ton.\nWhether we choose to write on a computer, phone, or in a notebook doesn’t matter. The important thing is that we find a setup that suits us. Besides, as Cole mentions, one doesn’t exclude the other.\nChanging your method for a period can work wonders if writer’s block comes knocking.\nKeep writing!",

Depression tries to trick me, to convince me: What will change if you go out? This happens every time I am stuck in the depression loop (as I like to call it).

I’ve been struggling with finishing Daughter of Fire by Sofia Robleda for my Book club book, and thought it was just me.

I don’t typically have issues with historical fiction books, but this one is a struggle.\nMy current predicament: Do I continue reading it or do I start on our next book club pick?\nI hate starting things, and not finishing them. I am only 77% through the book so I still have about a quarter of it left (1h10m). My heart is not into this book, the book club discussion already happened (and I was still able to participate)… so is there still a reason to finish it?\nMy list of Did Not Finish books is growing and it’s making me antsy. Outside of this book, I have the following shelved to one day finish (or maybe not)…\nBig Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert\nThe Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden\nOne in a Millennial by Kate Kennedy (audiobook)\nInterior Chinatown by Charles Yu\nI’m trying to feel less guilty about these unfinished books.
