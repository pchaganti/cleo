          "description": "In our previous post, we documented the significant growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) over the past decade, but also argued for and showed evidence of NBFIs’ dependence on banks for funding and liquidity support. In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.",

In this post, we argue instead that banks and NBFIs are better described as intimately interconnected, with NBFIs being especially dependent on banks both for term loans and lines of credit.",

One of the pictures caught my eye. It said:\nAlways be a little kinder than necessary.\nWise words! And so simple. A free gesture that can brighten someone's day.\nA little smile. A thumbs up. A \"tell the chef the food was delicious\".\nWe don't need to exaggerate. We don't have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.\nBut we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.\nIf we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.\nRecommended reading: Hidden Battles: The Importance of Choosing Kindness.",

          "description": "“You look tired today.”\nIt wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.\nFor the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.\nWe live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.\nAnd so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.\nYou see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.\nBe kind. Be gentle.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",
