          "description": "Been thinking about this a lot [1]. Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?\nThe future promised in Star Trek and even Apple's Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.\nCombining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.\nPath forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.\nI am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.\n[1] https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJsITGzXd0",

          "description": "As a programmer of over 20 years - this is terrifying.\nI'm willing to accept that I just have \"get off my lawn\" syndrome or something.\nBut the idea of letting an LLM write/move large swaths of code seems so incredibly irresponsible. Whenever I sit down to write some code, be it a large implementation or a small function, I think about what other people (or future versions of myself) will struggle with when interacting with the code. Is it clear and concise? Is it too clever? Is it too easy to write a subtle bug when making changes? Have I made it totally clear that X is relying on Y dangerous behavior by adding a comment or intentionally making it visible in some other way?\nIt goes the other way too. If I know someone well (or their style) then it makes evaluating their code easier. The more time I spend in a codebase the better idea I have of what the writer was trying to do. I remember spending a lot of time reading the early Redis codebase and got a pretty good sense of how Salvatore thinks. Or altering my approaches to code reviews depending on which coworker was submitting it. These weren't things I were doing out of desire but because all non-trivial code has so much subtlety; it's just the nature of the beast.\nSo the thought of opening up a codebase that was cobbled together by an AI is just scary to me. Subtle bugs and errors would be equally distributed across the whole thing instead of where the writer was less competent (as is often the case). The whole thing just sounds like a gargantuan mess.\nChange my mind.",

If you opened an issue on github we'd usually reply that day.\nIt's getting a bit long in the tooth, but I feel like 'the mythical man month' should still be required reading for software devs. More devs != better.",

Doing a little bit of division, that means that every single member of the Flutter team is responsible for the needs of 20,000 Flutter developers! That ratio is clearly unworkable for any semblance of customer support.\nIf \"only\" 50 people working on a project used by one million people was unworkably low then every single successful project out there would be doomed. I've certainly worked on things with much worse ratios than that.\n> one has to critically assess why a team that loves external contributions has only managed to merge contributions from 1,500 developers over a span of nearly a decade.\nExternal contributions from 1500 developers over a decade is a lot. That is an unusually high number, not a low one, and backs up Flutter's claim to love external contributions.\nThe fact that this person thinks that they can just magically conjure up dozens of volunteer PR reviewers is wild. Everything about this post makes it pretty clear that they don't have the slightest clue of the scope of what they're trying to do. This feels like one of the standard examples of an ex-bigco person setting off on their own with no understanding how just how much the bigco did in the background to facilitate their job.",

          "description": "It gets so much worse. Today, my sales guy was trying to register for WordCamp, a conference that we have been attending for years as an essential place to meet customers. And then he encountered the registration form for a WordPress.org login, which neatly specifies that you affirm you have no “affiliation with WP Engine, whether financial or otherwise.” [1]\nOf course, my company does have an affiliation with WP Engine. We use their service to host our website. Therefore, nobody on my team can register for a WordPress.org account.\nI wrote an open letter to Matt Mullenweg complaining about the requirement and stating that I believe it violates the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by being an overly broad prohibition that is clearly anti-competitive and has no clear business justification (aside from limiting competition).\nMatt and the rest of the people backing Automattic should take note: Moves like this that destroy your community will eventually usher in a replacement. WordPress is pretty neat, but it only got that way because thousands of people put millions of hours into building add-ons and hosting services to make it blossom into what it is today. If their efforts are redirected in another direction, WordPress will wither away to nothing in a few years.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/ksimpson_open-letter-to-matt-...",

Not just teaching someone information but lighting a fire in them to seek out knowledge on their own.\nThat’s when it all changes.

That inner motivation is what takes learning beyond just facts and assignments—it makes it something exciting and meaningful.\n\nBut how do we actually make this shift?

          "description": "I used to struggle with explaining why some of my friends or family members didn’t quite fit into any of the 16 MBTI personality types. A friend of mine seemed like an INFP but had traits of an ISTJ, and my cousin felt like an ESFP, yet was as considerate as an ESFJ.\nThen I stumbled upon Personality Ninja (or \"NXT\"), which uses 32 types instead of just 16. Suddenly, things started to make sense.\nAt first, I thought, “What? There are only 16 types!” But after trying it out with friends, I realized their new descriptions actually felt accurate. This system offered flexibility and depth the original 16 types didn’t seem to capture.\nCurious, I dove deeper into whether 32 types could really work—and found out there’s no reason they can’t! If you look back at Carl Jung, who created the concept of cognitive functions, he didn’t enforce the rigid stacks we see in MBTI or the Harold Grant function model.\nPersonality Ninja’s approach allows both the first and second functions to be in the same attitude (both extraverted or both introverted), unlike MBTI’s requirement for them to be opposites.\nThis flexibility means types don’t have to follow TeSi or SiTe formats—they can be TeSe or SiTi. It was the answer I’d been looking for: my friend turned out to be FiSi, while my cousin was FeSe.\nSo if you’ve ever felt stuck trying to fit yourself or others into the 16 types, it might be worth exploring the 32-type approach!",
