Following its peak at 6.6 percent in September 2022, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down rapidly over the last two years, falling to 3.6 percent recently. What explains the rapid shifts in U.S. inflation dynamics? In a recent paper, we show that the interaction between supply chain pressures and labor market tightness amplified the inflation surge in 2021. In this post, we argue that these same forces that drove the nonlinear rise in inflation have worked in reverse since late 2022, accelerating the disinflationary process. The current episode contrasts with periods where the economy was hit by shocks to either imported inputs or to labor alone.",

          "description": "While this author is of a younger generation, this really resonated with me as a Gen Xer. I feel there is so much disillusionment among folks that came of age during the 90s because there was so much techno optimism then, and it didn't quite turn out like we envisioned. Two things made me think about this recently:\n1. I saw a Reddit post that was titled something like \"The 90s were peak humanity. Enough tech to make life comfortable, but not so much that it had totally taken over the focus.\" It was a video of a packed mall around the holidays filled with generally happy people socializing in public.\n2. That viral quote that was making the rounds, \"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.\"\nI just feel there has been a growing chasm over the past 25 years where tech is no longer solving pressing human problems (generally, obviously not true in all areas e.g. decarbonization tech) but is more concerned with just rent-seeking value extraction.",

Company decides to use peer-ro-peer instead so the ISP starts installing spyware on customer computers.\nMakes me wonder where this myth of \"good Korean internet\" even came from if everything ends up so bandwidth constrained. Is it because all the customers and services are in the same city so it appears low latency?\nI hope everyone involved in this catches criminal charges, all the way up the chain.

Before MSFT bundled Teams with O365 we were rapidly growing and closing enterprise customers in the automotive, energy and education industries with high retention rates.

I am happy he's finally going to be free but I am still in deep sadness because this is not the world we are supposed to living in.

This scares me a lot because it is a growing problem and every day it seems like humanity is losing more and more of itself to evil and greedy powers that be. Assange did a great thing by exposing corrupt and criminal behavior at the highest levels and got such a inhumane treatment from the most powerful organizations on earth.

          "description": "Impressions from last week’s CVPR, a conference with 12k attendees on computer vision - Pretty much everyone is using NVIDIA GPUs, and pretty much everyone isn’t happy with the prices, and would like some competition in the space:\nNVIDIA was there with 57 papers, a website dedicated to their research presented at the conference, a full day tutorial on accelerating deep learning, and ever present with shirts and backpacks in the corridors and at poster presentations.\nAMD had a booth at the expo part, where they were raffling off some GPUs. I went up to them to ask what framework I should look into, when writing kernels (ideally from Python) for GPGPU. They referred me to the “technical guy”, who it turns out had a demo on inference on an LLM. Which he couldn’t show me, as the laptop with the APU had crashed and wouldn’t reboot. He didn’t know about writing kernels, but told me there was a compiler guy who might be able to help, but he wasn’t to be found at that moment, and I couldn’t find him when returning to the booth later.\nI’m not at all happy with this situation. As long as AMDs investment into software and evangelism remains at ~$0, I don’t see how any hardware they put out will make a difference. And you’ll continue to hear people walking away from their booth, saying “oh when I win it I’m going to sell it to buy myself an NVIDIA GPU”.",

He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stanstead airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.\nThis is the result of a  global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom  campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum,  all the way to the United Nations. This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible.\nAfter more than five years in a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars.\nWikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles,and for the people's right to know.\nAs he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom.\nJulian's freedom is our freedom.\n[More details to follow]",

          "description": "This happened to me. I was wondering why my internet speeds were slow when I discovered that Microsoft was in the process of uploading my users directory, they had already uploaded almost two gigs when I realized. They also changed the path to these directories to something like C:\\Users\\name\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\. Another poster in this thread claimed it's easy to reverse -- I disagree, it's a pain in the ass to track down the setting, and I shouldn't have to do this. When I did, it gave me an error for one of the directories and refuses to revert (documents?).\nI don't like leaving negative or hyperbolic comments on HN, but this was enraging and unacceptable to me. It's hard to convey without coming off as unhinged. I only ever boot into Windows nowadays when I need to compile and test a Windows build of software. I understand Microsoft has built up good will through efforts like VS Code, but it's all undone because of things like this. I avoid MS products, they cannot be trusted.",

Apple prevents developers from saying that Apple takes a % cut of the sale. Apple prevents developers from saying its available cheaper elsewhere. If Apple feels these rules are so just and fair and indispuitably correct, why does it go to such measures to hide them from its consumers?\nConsistently these anti-steering rules are what gets Apple in trouble all around the world. It's the one part Apple lost in the US Epic case, and it's the EUs first point on their breach. Apple has done this to themselves by being so stubborn and refusing to budge an inch on how they run their platforms. The tiniest concession years ago could have avoided all this regulation on them.",

The train cars are absurdly small — I'm used to them being subway sized — and fit probably no more than 10 people each.

The assertion that Manhattan's Chinatown has succumbed to the relentless march of urban evolution is not just an observation; it's a stark reality.

It's so incredibly stupid and ridiculous that it's embarrassing to even mention it.\nI'm doing this because I love it. If others like it too, great, but that's not the main purpose.\nNo one likes everything we do, whether we're a small blogger or the biggest artist in the world. On the other hand, we will always think that our latest creations are our best. Why else would we continue?\nWe are all different—equally different.\nYou're sitting on the world's best joke, looking forward to the laughter, but you're met with the reaction: “Is that all?”\nDifferent.\nYou tell someone about the greatest movie ever made and then ask what they thought: “It wasn't to my taste, so I turned it off after half an hour.\"\nDifferent.\nYou like watching football.

But some have. Some of these people are miles away, and have maybe always been miles away, both geographically and otherwise.\nIt's a really painful thing, because as these memories I hold go further and further back in my memory, I don't know what I want anymore. All I really want is to feel the way they made me feel again. Not so easy though, is it?\nWe've both grown in separate ways, and I'm grateful for where I am in my life, I think I've done pretty alright for myself so far.

          "description": "I’m not a fan of having dark mode on my site because I have a hard time choosing colors that speak to me. I like to keep things minimalistic with my colors, and for me, it’s just much easier to do with a white background. However, I know (and acknowledge) the importance of having one, and so I pushed myself to do some tinkering on the blog this morning. Besides, my eyeballs also hate me when I look at my site at night, and so I’m sure it’s the case for other people too.\nI subscribe to a lot of blogs via RSS reader, but I do take the extra step to launch their site to read the post. I have a deep appreciation for those who take the time to design their site the way they want, and so I want to read their posts the way it was meant to be read. It’s kind of like: listening to an album in order because I know that the artist ordered it a specific way for people to listen to. At the same time, it’s OK if you want to shuffle the playlist if you as the consumer want to, just like it’s OK for those who read my posts to do so via an RSS feed.\nAnyways, this is just a quick post to say that, if your preference is dark mode, it is now available on here. I’ll revisit my site again at night time to test out the color contrasts (since I worked on this during daytime) to see if it makes sense, or if my eyeballs are still straining to read things.\nDue to this, I’ve also gone ahead and created a Changelog for my site, so I can keep track of the little (and big) changes I make on here.\nSide note:\nI typically do have my screens on dark mode, and so if the sites/blog I read have dark mode, I read those in dark mode. It’s a weird thing for me to want my site in a lighter background, but I do struggle with it sometimes. Thanks to those who have put up with probably burning your retinas reading my posts if you weren’t doing so in an RSS reader.

Usually I write my random thoughts in there, as I figured I had become above the notes app and was looking for reasons to stay off my phone. Of course, as soon as I lose my means of documenting my ideas, all sorts of events pass me by with nowhere to write about them. I've only just finished high school, recently lost my grandmother, and all sorts of change is crashing my way, and now I need to just stew in it..? Or worse, take to my notes app??\nThen lo and behold, there's the zine just sitting on the shelf. Scrolling through these websites here, I figured maybe it was a sign. Or I'm just bored and want a new hobby. Only God knows. So anyway, I'm hoping I'll still find my notebook once I get around to cleaning my room. Maybe then I can even publish those thoughts in there!

At that time the A.W.A. had groups and members in England and Scotland, and a sympathiser or two in Ireland, and published the monthly newspaper ‘Anarchist Worker’. The text below was adopted as a ‘provisional’ rather than as a definitive text by the tendency whose members went on to publish ‘Libertarian Communist’, and renamed t…",
