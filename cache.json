          "description": "The UAW is on a roll. After winning stupendous contracts at the Big Three automakers this past year, the union then organized Volkswagen in Tennessee April 20. What’s eye-popping about this is that the UAW succeeded not only in the South, but also with a foreign car manufacturer – a twofer. Now as the union zooms in on a May vote by 5000 workers at Mercedes in Alabama, the larger implications of Shawn Fain’s still relatively new union presidency have become clear, namely, a change in workers’ culture in the anti-union, right-to-work South; because if the UAW racks up more wins in the region, that will alter the local political ecosystem. Politicos will find themselves in an environment that includes a growing union presence, something they have sought to extirpate for generations.

          "description": "This morning, the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit for the first quarter of 2024. Household debt balances grew by $184 billion over the previous quarter, slightly less than the moderate growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. Housing debt balances grew by $206 billion. Auto loans saw a $9 billion increase, continuing their steady growth since the second quarter of 2020, while balances on other non-housing debts fell. Credit card balances fell by $14 billion, which is typical for the first quarter. However, an increasing number of borrowers are behind on credit card payments. In this post, we explore the relationship between credit card delinquency and changes in credit card “utilization rates.”",

This surge, often referred to as the Great Resignation, or the Great Reshuffle, was uncommonly large for an economic expansion. In this post, we call attention to a related labor market change that has not been previously highlighted—a persistent change in retirement expectations, with workers reporting much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67. This decline is particularly notable for female workers and lower-income workers.",

          "description": "The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?",

I decided several years ago that I’m not buying another iPad until this is sorted out by iPadOS.\nI think of iPhones as personal devices, where each person may have their own. But iPads are more likely to be shared for personal use in families. The fact that each person using it cannot have their own user profiles, app data, etc., is a huge drawback. Apple has supported this for a long time (though probably not in the best way) for education, but it’s not available to others. Even tvOS supports switching between user profiles quickly.\nApple enforcing the idea that iPad (with iPadOS) should also be a personal device — one device per person — makes the user experience quite poor.",

For every college-educated young person smugly pointing out that they aren't fooled by an image with six-fingered hands, there are far more people who had marginal media literacy to begin with and are now almost defenceless against a tidal wave of hyper-scaleable deception.\nWe're already at a point where we're counselling elders to ignore late-night messages from people claiming to be a relative in need of an urgent wire transfer. What defences do we have when an LLM will be able to have a completely fluent, natural-sounding conversation in someone else's voice? I'm not confident that I'd be able to distinguish GPT-4o from a human speaker in the best of circumstances and I'm almost certain that I could be fooled if I'm hurried, distracted, sleep deprived or otherwise impaired.\nRegardless of any future impacts on the labour market or any hypothesised X-risks, I think we should be very worried about the immediate risks to trust and social cohesion. An awful lot of people are turning into paranoid weirdos at the moment and I don't particularly blame them, but I can see things getting seriously ugly if we can't abate that trend.",

OpenAI are masters of hype. They have been generating hype for years now, yet the real-world impacts remain modest so far.\nDo you remember when they teased GPT-2 as \"too dangerous\" for public access? I do. Yet we now have Llama 3 in the wild, which even at the smaller 8B size is about as powerful as the [edit: 6/13/23] GPT-4 release.\nAs someone pointed out elsewhere in the comments, a logistic curve looks exponential in the beginning, before it approaches saturation. Yet, logistic curves are more common, especially in ML. I think it's interesting that GPT-4o doesn't show much of an improvement in \"reasoning\" strength.",

          "description": "This is a very cool demo - if you dig deeper there’s a clip of them having a “blind” AI talk to another AI with live camera input to ask it to explain what it’s seeing. Then they, together, sing a song about what they’re looking at, alternating each line, and rhyming with one another. Given all of the isolated capabilities of AI, this isn’t particularly surprising, but seeing it all work together in real time is pretty incredible.\nBut it’s not scary. It’s… marvelous, cringey, uncomfortable, awe-inspiring. What’s scary is not what AI can currently do, but what we expect from it. Can it do math yet? Can it play chess? Can it write entire apps from scratch? Can it just do my entire job for me?\nWe’re moving toward a world where every job will be modeled, and you’ll either be an AI owner, a model architect, an agent/hardware engineer, a technician, or just.. training data.",

It feels more like texting than talking.\nThese demos show people talking to artificial intelligence. This is new. Humans are more partial to talking than writing. When people talk to each other (in person or over low-latency audio) there's a rich metadata channel of tone and timing, subtext, inexplicit knowledge. These videos seem to show the AI using this kind of metadata, in both input and output, and the conversation even flows reasonably well at times. I think this changes things a lot.",

Promises made, promises believed, we all used it. I was especially glad of Lazy Loading, where I didn't have to load data from the database into my memory structures; the system would do that automatically. I could write my code as if all my memory structures were populated and not worry about it. Except, it didn't work consistently. Every now and again a memory structure would not be populated, for no apparent reason. Digging deep into technet, I found a small note saying \"if this happens, then you can check whether the data has been loaded by checking the value of this flag and manually loading it if necessary\" [0]. So, in other words, I have to manually load all my data because I can't trust EF to do it for me. [1]\nLong analogy short, this is where I think AI for coding is now. It gets things wrong enough that I have to manually check everything it does and correct it, to the point where I might as well just do it myself in the first place. This might not always be the case, but that's where I feel it is right now.\n[0] Entity Framework has moved on a lot since then, and apparently now can be trusted to lazily load data.

          "description": "One thing that I think doesn't get enough attention in these types of discussions -- not just this article about ROI, but also earnings disparities between (e.g.) genders and other groups -- is that income isn't the only measure of happiness.\nMany people would take less money to do a job they enjoyed more.  My older sister \"gave up\" a sales \"career\" to become a fiction writer.  It's enough to pay the bills, but pays less than she could have had at a corporate job.  She got an English degree and couldn't be happier with her choice.\nMy younger sister got a Theater degree and is a \"struggling actress\".  Same deal: she's happy with her choice.\nROI is important for some aspects of the discussion.  But it is not the whole story.",

If they want to go this direction they should publish as a fork under a different name so upstream doesn't get constantly barraged by complaints of users having issues.\nThis reminds me of the time years ago when the Debian maintainer of Chromium decided to unilaterally disable the ability to install extensions.  Thankfully, more pragmatic minded people prevailed and the patch was reverted.\nThis also reminds me of a time many many many years ago when Debian removed the kernel interface that provided the ability to load binary firmware into network cards and broke networking for me.",

The only first-class flights I've taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)\nBesides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that's just the stuff that I've benefited from personally. I know there's more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I've never heard of. He was very good to us all.\nWe've always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.

          "description": "There's 2 genders, right? We all know that.\nOf course there is. You're either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you're a woman without said dangly bits.\nBut maybe there's more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn't feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it's the opposite? Or something in between?\nHonestly, I don't give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I'll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.\nLook, it's a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We've been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there's been 2 genders. Male and female.\nBut in the last few decades there's been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as \"him\" don't get up on your high horse and start screaming \"YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!\"\nI assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that's fine. Tell me politely and I'll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.\nIrony is, if you're not a dick about the whole thing, you're far more likely to get people on-side. You're always gonna get bigoted wankers, that's par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn't make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.\nIt just makes them human.\nPeace ✌🏻\nReply by email",

It's an eighteen-page oneshot and my very first contribution to an anthology, which is honestly very exciting. Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.\nWorking on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don't like inking, I half-ass shapes I don't understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don't really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing.

          "description": "I never really thought about it while growing up because I was raised in a religious family anyway and it's just how I was used to people talking, but at this point I've been living in Japan for several years and I often notice that very normal phrases take on a religious persona when translated to English. For example we have this word yokatta which literally translates as \"it was good\", but if you were to translate it normally to English as it's used than it would come out as \"thank God\". Or we have this other word kotoka which would be translated as \"God knows\" like \"God only knows how bored I am\" (なんて暇なことか). Also a lot of words in English are shortened versions of old phrases with religious significance like \"Goodbye\" coming from \"God be with ye\", and a lot of set phrases or common expressions in English that people use all the time come straight from the Bible like \"a drop in the bucket\", \"go the extra mile\", \"by the skin of your teeth\", \"the root of the matter\", \"a labor of love\", \"scapegoat\", \"broken heart\", \"eye for an eye\", \"rise and shine\", \"fall by the wayside\", or \"a wolf in sheep's clothing\"\nI'm not suggesting that it's a bad thing (and I don't think it is), and Japanese has a lot of similar words or phrases which come from a religious origin too. It's just kinda weird to notice in retrospect how in English-speaking countries everything is experienced through a Judeo-Christian lens, even if you're an atheist.\nMaybe that's why Western society and Japanese society are so different.

Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.\nI'm happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We've noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It's no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we're nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.\nWe're trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well.

Why did these novels click with me?\nI pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:\nNo slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!\nCharacters are way more interesting to me than settings. I'd rather delve into a character's life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.\nI hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that's what I prefer.\nBook length doesn't bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.\nPlus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.\nSo, these are my current reading preferences, though I'm sure they'll evolve as I read more.\nFor now, I'm sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone soon.\nRight now, I'm reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It's packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long.

Here's the truth about living as a paradox:\nI'm drawn to happiness, sure, but I can't shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It's like there's a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I'm stuck in the middle.\nI'm not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there's a begrudging respect for the person I've become, scars and all.\nWhen I say \"I don't care,\" it's not because I'm indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It's just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.\nAttention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It's like I'm afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I'm just not used to being seen.\nI've been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I've tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.\nListening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn't. I'm great at keeping other people's secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I'd rather keep them locked away.\nSo yeah, I'm a walking contradiction.
