Already aware of the Nazi’s rabid anti-Semitism, the residents of nearby Tel Aviv, one of the relatively few Jewish settlements in Palestine at the time, prepared to tear down and burn the swastikas. But before they could storm the consulates, the erstwhile anti-fascists were halted by a combination of forces: the colonial authorities of the British, who were still in the mode of appeasing Hitler, and more surprisingly, the leadership of the Zionist movement, which sought a Jewish state in Palestine. While the British were fearful of igniting what would inevitably become World War II, the Zionists looked to preserve their own organizing and fundraising activities in Germany, then home to more than half a million Jews.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post The Transfer Agreement: Nazi Support for a Jewish State in Palestine appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

They discuss the process of pulling their works out of the exhibition; the importance of the academic and cultural boycott of Israel (PACBI); and what it means to be Jewish artists publicly confronting Jewish arts institutions that receive Zionist funding and are struggling to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.\nSteph Kudisch is a trans genderfluid artist whose work uses mutated intertidal aesthetics and personal storytelling to dwell in in-betweens. They work as a teaching artist on Lisjan Ohlone land, also known as the San Francisco Bay Area. Kudisch and their collaborator Kate Laster form Clear as Schmutz Press as well as the collective Hevra Kadisha in which they create site-specific works across the mediums of printmaking, sculpture, performance, and sound.\nSophia Sobko (she/they) is an artist, educator & researcher born in Moscow, USSR & based on Lisjan Ohlone Land in Oakland, CA.

          "description": "Since October 7, 2023, blatantly racist statements by Israeli leaders have been widely reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likened Palestinians to Amalekites, an ancient tribe in Old Testament lore whom Yahweh told the Israelites to destroy—men, women, children, infants, and cattle. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant referred to Israel’s assault on Gaza as a fight against “human animals.” Other Israeli officials called for erasing Gaza from the face of the earth, claiming that no Palestinian civilians are innocent.

          "description": "The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates. To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.",

          "description": "Shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023, a consortium of eleven large U.S. financial institutions deposited $30 billion into First Republic Bank to bolster its liquidity and assuage panic among uninsured depositors. In the end, however, First Republic Bank did not survive, raising the question of whether a reallocation of liquidity among financial institutions can ever reduce the need for central bank balance sheet expansion in the fight against bank runs. We explore this question in this post, based on a recent working paper.",

          "description": "Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status\nfield, in Kubernetes v1.31!\nThe Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the \"PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime\" feature, introduced\nas an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement\nhelps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between\ndifferent phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.\nFor a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a\n.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of\nwhen the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume\nis updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.\nWhat changed?\nThe API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the\ncurrent timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will\nbe overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.\nFor more details, read about\nPhase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",
