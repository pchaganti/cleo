Bases also facilitate the proliferation of nuclear weapons, with the United States keeping nuclear bombs in five NATO member countries, and nuclear-capable planes, ships, and missile launchers in many others. Because the U.S. is continually creating plans for military actions around the world, and because the U.S. military always has some troops “on the ready,” the initiation of combat operations is simpler.

These so-called safe havens spread across the northeastern part of the United States, from Minnesota to New York, and as far south as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the Virginias.  Like the “rust belt,” “bible belt,” or “cornbelt,” these post-industrial cities are being redefined by their legacy infrastructure access to freshwater and moderate weather. \nThe designation of climate safe havens offers a little bit of hope alongside the litany of dire studies highlighting the irreversible effects of climate change. Studies like this one from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)tell us that this past May was the hottest May recorded on Earth, marking it the 12th consecutive month of record-breaking heat. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reports that last year brought 28 weather and climate disaster that cost over a billion dollars in damages—yet another record broken. \nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Inside Big Tech’s Race to “Climate Safe-Havens” appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it's a major source of content for the Wayback machine.\nIn fact, that's the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone's site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).\nThere are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don't, and that applied whether they are bots or people.",

But all the API requests are right there in plain sight...\nThere are pretty common ethical standards about disclosing vulnerabilities privately before disclosing them publicly. I don't see how the obviousness of the vulnerability changes the situation. By warning the company, you give them the opportunity to remedy the problem before announcing to the world that anyone with a laptop can exploit it. Probably they were just hoping that nobody would notice, which is stupid of course, but now they don't have the chance to build up a better wall before the flood of fake orders that could cause real harm to the small businesses whose financial information you disclosed online.\nPerhaps I'm being too optimistic about how the company would respond, but I still think it's hard to justify not doing a private disclosure.",

This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time.

Even though no users were affected and we patched it right away, the hypothetical depth of this vulnerability is unacceptable. We’ve written up some technical details and how we’ll improve in the future (including moving off Firebase and setting up a proper bug bounty program) here: https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response.\nI'm really sorry about this, both the vuln itself and the delayed comms around it, and really appreciate all the feedback here – everything from disappointment to outrage to encouragement. It holds us accountable to do better, and makes sure we prioritize this moving forward. Thank you so much.",

It's not that I don't enjoy an occasional adventure—I do. It's just that I am very happy to have a nice time in my own home, surrounded by the things I've already accumulated that bring me pleasure. It was only as a teenager that I felt that restless call to get out and get away from home to experience something besides the same old, same old.\nGranted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don't have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I've been to a few really enjoy…",

          "description": "There’s nothing wrong with listening to podcasts and audiobooks. There’s a ton of great content out there. The problem is the amount I consume.\nMost of what I listen to falls under the productivity/self-improvement category, things you'd classify as \"good content.\" And in moderation, it can be helpful. Who doesn’t want to improve their life?\nBut I suck at moderation. I listen to back-to-back episodes, not giving myself time to process what I've heard. Hours of opinions and advice that rarely result in meaningful life change.\nThe constant audio stream prevents me from letting my mind wander. My thoughts are crowded out, and my attention is divided, making it difficult to fully engage with the present moment.\nThis weekend, I put my headphones away. I wanted to see how I felt without the distraction.\nAt first, it was uncomfortable because I have a habit of always listening to something. But after a few days, I appreciated times of silence. I felt more relaxed.\nFrom now on, I want to be more intentional about how much content I consume. I could limit myself to one episode of a podcast or one chapter of an audiobook.\nMore doesn't necessarily mean better. You can only absorb so much in one day, and at a certain point, there are diminishing returns. Often, a slow and steady approach works best.\nmail Email\n print Print\n share Share",

How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” \n I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things.
