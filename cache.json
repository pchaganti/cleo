This means that the destructive power of the explosives dropped on Gaza in just over two months exceeded that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[4] According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the use of such highly destructive bombs in residential areas constitutes a war crime.

On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:\ncgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet\nand CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use\nthe same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a\nsource of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!\nAutomated cgroup driver detection\nIn v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate\nKubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI\nimplementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes\nhappened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations\n(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!\nIn addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their\nCRI implementation is new enough:\ncontainerd: Support was added in v2.0.0\nCRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0\nThen, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the\ncgroup_driver they would like to use.\nFuture work\nEventually, support for the kubelet's cgroupDriver configuration field will be\ndropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn't new\nenough to have support for this feature.",

A manager _can_ contact an employee on a Sunday, but then the employee is immediately on weekend-rate overtime even if they just got an email with \"deal with this next week\". So, many companies have systems that hold back e-mail sent outside of working hours until the next working day unless specially authorised and costed.\nNever underestimate an economics-based solution to a legal problem, a.k.a. \"if you really want to ban it, tax it\".",

There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.\nOf course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That's not something you will figure out from a short-term A/B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.\nI see this dynamic frequently with A/B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A/B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through. The question of which is actually better seemed to have been totally forgotten.",

I'll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, \"The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they'll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else.\" This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.\nAfter I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I'd need to be \"one of them.\" I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.\nI know not every manager is like that. I'd like to think I wasn't. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.",

          "description": "In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.\nThe Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.\nThe report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.\nIndeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he'd done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.",

          "description": "Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.\nAs someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.\nEven after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.\nAnd if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.\nAdmittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.",

The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn't belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn't enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn't have my glasses, phone, or wallet.\nI really don't know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car. I had to beg for money and walk the last several miles once I recognized finally where I was. It really sucked, and ever since then I've had a great deal of sympathy for people that are churned through this terrible system and spit right back out with no dignity whatsoever, let alone empathy. This incident disrupted my life irreversibly (ended up missing tests and having to do a medical withdrawal from school, lost scholarships, etc) and derailed a lot of things I had wanted to do for many, many years. The hospital/medical care industrial complex doesn't optimize for empathy. They're just trying to get the bodies through as quickly as possible.",

His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.\nLate that night, he was discharged. Not even \"he checked himself out\". The hospital discharged him (and that's over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).\nHe had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn't remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn't get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.\nThe hospital had his mother's contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.\nWe still don't know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.\nForcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I'm furious about it.  Apparently it's common and not even something there's any recourse for.",

          "description": "> Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design.\nThis is a super underappreciated fact!  It's often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.\nSteel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.\nDo you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.\nThink of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.\nFor any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.  Blacksmiths had a legitimately intellectual job back in the day!",

I'm looking forward to being able to focus on the sort of platform-y work that I want to do. It's going to be so much fun!\nOf course, before I can get to the new gig I'll spend the next three weeks wrapping up and/or handing off everything that I'd been working on for my current employer. It's a good thing that past-John typically did a good job of documenting things as he went. Still, it's going to be a busy few weeks!\nOh, and that other position that I interviewed for? I got rejected, and the company went on to break the entire world the following week. So I guess that one actually worked out pretty well for me, too.",

It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.\nI had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!\nBut over time, something started to feel off. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.\nThen one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.\n– Yes, I can't imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.\nIn that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!\nWhen I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.\nFast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.\nAnd when it comes to IT, I'm more passionate about it now that it's a hobby instead of a career. It's fun again!\nAre you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.\nChok Dee, as they say in Thailand.",

At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.\nI just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.\nI’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.\nI haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things.

          "description": "The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.\nThis time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”\nMy heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”\nSurely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.\nSometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”\nIn all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.\nI just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”\n~ dreams by fleetwood mac,\n<3 K\n🍄\nhttps://marblethoughts.bearblog.dev/",
