On the other hand, the U.S. wealth inequality virus continues to become more virulent as reflected in widespread poverty, food insecurity, homelessness, and other social ills. Over time, the wealth inequality virus, like Covid-19, has had its ups and downs in the damage it causes. Figures on the distribution of family wealth provided by the Federal Reserve Board show that when the wealth inequality virus recovers after a downturn, it generally produces new levels of inequality.

He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him.

          "description": "Trying to understand consumer privacy behaviors outside the prevalent social contract that the vast majority of people operate under is bound to missinterpret what is happening and why.\nWe live in a regulated \"supermarket\" economy. What surfaces on a screen is entirely analogous to what surfaces on a shelf: People check the price and make their choices based on taste, budget etc. They are not idiots, they operate under a simplifying assumption that makes life in a complex world possible.\nThe implicit assumption central to this way of organising the economy is that anything legally on sale is \"safe\". That it has been checked and approved by experts that know what they are doing and have the consumer interest as top priority.\nPeople will not rush back home to their chemistry labs to check what is in their purchased food, whether it corresponds to the label (assuming that such a label even exists) and what might be the short or long term health effects. They dont have the knowledge, resources and time to do that for all the stuff they get exposed to.\nWhat has drifted in the digital economy is not consumer standards, it is regulatory standards. Surfacing digital products with questionable short and long term implications for individuals and society has become a lucrative business, has captured its regulatory environment and will keep exploiting opportunities and blind spots until there is pushback.\nUltimately regulators only derive legitimacy from serving their constituencies, but that feedback loop can be very slow and it gets tangled with myriad other unrelated political issues.",

I spent years with an AMD card growing progressively more annoyed at their self-inflicted apparent inability to multiply matrices on demand. Nvidia had nothing to do with their failure, unless they had some sort of high-level mole in AMD's driver teams.\nHitting the only successful company in a difficult field with legal assaults is not the obvious path to success. Nvidia has nothing close to a monopoly; there is no moat and they operate in a commodity space that will behave like a normal competitive market. It just happens that their competitors were wall-to-wall complacent about how quickly the hardware world can change and they stupidly thought graphics cards were for displaying graphics. It turns out graphics cards are for building AI and crypto markets.",

It's not economically viable at over $1 billion per launch.\nAs for Blue Origin and New Glenn, this is an object lesson that simply throwing money at the problem doesn't necessarily solve it. Did you know Blue Origin was founded ~18 months before SpaceX?\nFor the longest time (up until ~9 months ago), Bezos had the former Honeywell CEO in charge of Blue Origin, which to me was such an odd choice. You see, this guy seems to embody everything wrong with corporate America: he was completely focused on not failing rather than succeeding. So there were constant delays with New Glenn and the BE-4 engine, which is years behind schedule. You can't fail if you don't launch.\nAnd the new CEO (David Limp) used to be in charge of Kindles.",

If I’m going natural PK, I make email the primary key.\nBut … then we add the ability for users to update their email. But it should still be the same user! This is trivial if we have a surrogate primary key, a nightmare if we made email the natural primary key.\nOr building on that example, maybe at first we always require an email from our users. But later we also allow phone auth, and you just need an email OR a phone number. And later we add user name auth, SSO, etc. Again, all good with surrogate primary keys, a nightmare with natural primary keys.\nThere are countless examples like this. You brought up cars, same thing with licence plates, for example. Or even Social Security Numbers/Social Insurance Numbers - in Canada SINs are generally permanent, but temporary residents can have their SIN change if they later become permanent residents, but they’re still the same person.\nYou want your entities to have stable identity, even if things you at one time thought gave them identity change. Surrogate primary keys do that, natural primary keys do not. Don’t use natural primary keys, use surrogate primary keys with unique constraints/indexes.\nI challenge you to come up with a single plausible example where you’re screwing yourself by choosing surrogate PK + unique constraints/indexes. Meanwhile there are endless examples where you’re screwing yourself by choosing natural PK.",

          "description": "Because this opinion has surfaced a number of times here: Yes, Tolkien did care deeply about the realism of his world. And because he spent his whole life studying pre-modern societies, the societies he creates in Middle Earth do function very realistically. I think there are two reason why many readers miss this:\n(1) Much of Tolkien's world-building is implicit rather than explicit. He doesn't talk about Aragorn's tax policy because he doesn't need to; Aragorn is recognisably a feudal king and there is a standard way taxes are done a feudal system (i.e. the vassals take care of gathering them). Tolkien has a deep understanding of how such societies function, but much of this comes out indirectly in the story, through the way the characters behave and what they can and cannot do.\n(2) Pre-modern societies are so deeply different from modern ones (economically, culturally, and socially) that I think many readers stumble across things they find unexpected and dismiss it as \"unrealistic fantasy\", without understanding that in such a context, this is exactly how one would expect the world to work. For example, the deep devotion and self-sacrificial service Sam shows to Frodo is often discussed in terms of friendship (and it is a great friendship), but one cannot fully understand it unless one also understands it as a (very positive) master-servant relationship.\nIf you want a better understanding of the deeper realism of LotR, I cannot recommend Bret Devereaux' blog highly enough. He is an ancient military historian and has written extensive (but entertaining!) analyses of both LotR and GoT. See here for two samples: https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helm..., https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-wa...",

They're not great at that purpose, but they're good enough and they generally produce false negatives (smart people fail) rather than false positives (you hire an idiot). And this makes sense, because a false negative is low cost (maybe you spend 50% longer interviewing candidates) but a false positive is high cost (you hire an idiot and have to spend months establishing that, firing them and starting the hiring process again).\nThe side effect of this though, is that it's an extremely painful process for the applicant. Even if you're a great software engineer, you're going to freeze up, miss something, have a bad day, and fail a few interviews. Now for most software engineers failure is an unusual and harrowing experience, so they react really badly to it. Especially ina \n scenario where it's difficult to blame anyone but yourself. But just don't! It's fine! just move on, there's plenty of jobs and the interview process is a blunt tool, not a final evaluation of your worth in life.",

Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.\n2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear/similar objective.\nMeet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…\nOr is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.\nTo the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.\nI’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree/number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.\nSomeone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree/number theory/inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.",

          "description": "Totally fair question! My reasons were:\n1. To maximize Photon's battery life I tried to make the hardware do the absolute minimum to record imagery. To that end, Photon stores images on an unformatted SD card (ie one huge linear array of bytes) which is easy and fast to index into.\n2. A 16-bit MSP430 handles writing the image data, and the MSP430's codespace is 99% exhausted without dealing with the complexities of a filesystem like FAT32, so adding support for a filesystem wouldn't currently fit. (This line of MSP430, MSP430FR2433, has a maximum of 16 KB of FRAM, but perhaps I could use a different line.)\n3. Photon stores images as RAW image data that require post-processing to view the images. Since I wanted to provide a polished app to view the imagery anyway, I figured I'd just make it a requirement.\nI'm not saying those are all particularly good reasons, but that was my reasoning anyhow.",

          "description": "My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.\nWell, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.\nMy old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.\nAnyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.",

It's just an idea, an idea of how things work.\nYou have something to write.\nYou write it.\nIt doesn't have to be like that. It's perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.\nThere are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...\nIt should be sunny on Midsummer day (it's a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).\nWhen life doesn't go the way it's “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.\nWhat if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things \"should be”? What if we face the day with a little \"let's see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings\"?\nIt's worth trying.\nall posts · rss feed",

Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.\nSometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way.

When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn't know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn't that easy.\nAfter he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time.
