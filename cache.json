In addition, while overall deposit funding has remained stable, we find that the banks most affected by the March 2023 events are offering higher deposit rates and are growing their deposit funding relative to the broader banking industry.",

          "description": "While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins? We conclude with some high-level discussion points on potential regulations of stablecoins.",

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.",

Inflation has been gradually declining since 2022 without a notable slowdown in the labor market. Nonetheless, inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target and the path of the so-called final mile remains uncertain, as emphasized by Chair Powell during his press conference in January. In this post, we examine the unemployment-inflation trade-off over the past few years through the lens of a New Keynesian Phillips curve, based on our recent paper. We also provide model-based forecasts for 2024 and 2025 under various labor market scenarios.",

After reaching a peak of 11 percent in the second quarter of 2021, world trade prices dropped by more than five percentage points by the middle of 2023. U.S. import prices followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak and a deeper trough. In a new study, we investigate what drove these price movements by using information on the prices charged for products shipped from fifty-two exporters to fifty-two importers, comprising more than twenty-five million trade flows. We uncover several patterns in the data: (i) From 2021:Q1 to 2022:Q2, almost all of the growth in U.S. import prices can be attributed to global factors, that is, trends present in most countries; (ii) at the end of 2022, U.S. import price inflation started to be driven by U.S. demand factors; (iii) in 2023, foreign suppliers to the U.S. market caught up with demand and account for the decline in import price inflation, with a significant role played by China.",

Going forward, BEVs will likely claim a growing share of global motor vehicle sales, helped along by subsides and mandates implemented in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. Nevertheless, China’s success in selling BEVs may not contribute much to its GDP growth, owing both to the maturity of its motor vehicle sector and the strong tendency for countries to protect this high-profile industry.",

Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run.

We’re building an app that automatically figures out what lawyers are doing and generates timesheets for them. Here’s a quick demo: https://youtu.be/yrL3e1hgaNc, and here’s an even quicker one: https://youtu.be/giIaAxZp2M0.\nIf you’ve ever hired a lawyer, you know most of them bill by the hour—or more specifically, by the 0.1 of an hour (hence our name!). What most clients don’t realize is how painful it is for lawyers to track all their work in 6-minute increments. Lawyers hate time tracking, and many say it’s the worst part of their jobs.\nAdrian started out his career as a corporate lawyer at Fenwick & West. The first thing he was taught was how to track and bill his time. Between the 70-hour work weeks and billin…",

I'm in my forties and still have two living grandparents, and am very grateful for them. I remember a lot of days where my grandmother watched me and my sister, and she was able to do that because she was only in her late 40's herself and plenty mobile. I knew two of my great grandmothers, one of them only dying in my teens.\nNot everyone can rely on parents to help with childcare, but it is worth keeping in mind that if you wait until your mid 30's they might not be able to catch a running toddler like they could a decade earlier.\nMy mom also managed to have a really good career, though she went to night school when I was around 6 and worked her ass off in general. But, she had a high earning partner to support her.\nI don't really have a single point here, except that I worry we've ignored the less-obvious downsides to people delaying childbearing until their mid 30's.",

          "description": "I've started to bring up Admiral Rickover's speech Doing a Job in all of the Boeing threads because he is just so relevant. Admiral Rickover was the man responsible for America having nuclear submarines. https://govleaders.org/rickover.htm\nThe speech is well worth a read in its entirety and it feels prescient in regards to Boeing. I think this paragraph more than any other hits at the core problem at Boeing:\n> Unless the individual truly responsible can be identified when something goes wrong, no one has really been responsible. With the advent of modern management theories it is becoming common for organizations to deal with problems in a collective manner, by dividing programs into subprograms, with no one left responsible for the entire effort. There is also the tendency to establish more and more levels of management, on the theory that this gives better control. These are but different forms of shared responsibility, which easily lead to no one being responsible—a problems that often inheres in large corporations as well as in the Defense Department.\nTo contrast here is a statement from Calhoun: “We caused the problem. And we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders, and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence,” Calhoun said.\nThat we is him failing to take personal responsibility and choosing instead to spread responsibility to all employees, making no one responsible for the state of Boeing.\nBoeing needs a leader who will take personal responsibility.",

          "description": "I'm an ER doc. I work 3 nights a week and see probably 5--10 patients a week who have waited over 3 hours.\nThe basic answer: most people don't go to the ER for emergencies. That is, they go for something like a rash, cough, or fatigue that they know is not an emergency. Many of them just want work notes, although some are convinced they have a legit emergency.\nWe scoop up the real emergencies from the waiting room ASAP. Eg, no one in the waiting room is wearing a tourniquet; if they are, it's my job to either fix the bleed or get them to a vascular surgeon ASAP if I can't.\nThe majority of people who spend hours in the ER waiting room have vastly higher time preference than your or I, and often lower socioeconomic status and higher anxiety as well. Often they can't afford phone service or even a car, so it's hard for them to get places quickly. Others are homeless and want a place to sleep or very anxious and just want to be somewhere with other people in the middle of the night.",

          "description": "Current personal suspicion after watching your linked video (excellent discussion by the wgowshipping author) is:\nCatastrophic engine failure (1:24) causing wide scale power loss.\nNo rudder control, rudder drift, and ship alignment drift (1:24-1:25:30)\nPower restored and ship reengages prop with bad ship/ruddder alignment (1:25).  However, ship is now pushing itself into a further bad turn. Pilot likely stomps the brakes realizing misalignment.  Obviously 2-3 minutes is not enough to stop 100,000 tons at 8.5 kts, since it only got to 7.5 kts before crashing.  Power loss may have caused total rudder loss.\nSimilar to a car that hits ice, wheels have arbitrary alignment when they reengage road, when power starts being delivered again, car swerves towards concrete barrier even with brakes.  Driver with limited crash experience is mostly just panicking and stomping.\nHow many pilots, trained or not, really have any experience with a 100,000 ton ship in a crash situation with responses where seconds matter?\nEdit: Also, economic disaster for Baltimore.\n> (Wiki) The Port of Baltimore generates $3 billion in annual wages and salary, as well as supporting 14,630 direct jobs and 108,000 jobs connected to port work. In 2014, the port generated more than $300 million in taxes.  1st in automobiles, light trucks, farm and construction machinery, imported forest products, aluminum, and sugar. 2nd in coal exports.\nEdit2: Bloomberg has an economic look including info on autos.  ~$500 million in March 2024 so far.  Honda, Mercedes, Subaru likely worst hit.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJmvXiCWkAAgDcE?format=png&name=...\n3,600 commercial trucks / day.  Hazardous material transport has a 30 mile detour.  Baltimore had $350 million of insurance.

          "description": "At least in the links with the video now you can see that the container ship directly hits one of the two main (and in the central area only) pillars completely collapsing it.\nNo matter(1) the engineering there is no pretty much way to not lose the whole large middle area and left area leading to the destroyed pillar in that situation.\nSuch a collapse crates so much force (tension vibrations etc.) so that the collapse of the section right of the right pillar is not unreasonable.\nThe only question is if the impact should have made the pillar collapse.\nBut a loaded container ship is ... absurdly massive I mean they are like multiple  high raise building (but not sky scrapers) standing squished together side by side. So the force it can apply is huge and if cargo moving in it there will be force applied to whatever it crashes into even after the initial impact.\nAnd looking at the waves caused by impact with the base it was at least 8m high I think (depending on the container ship). So that wasn't a \"slow moving\" impact. And even slow moving impacts with container ships can tear apart a solid jetty.\nSo while the US has issues with infrastructure maintenance idk. if anything but building a many pillar bridge would have made any difference. And building a many pillar bridge might not be very viable depending on the under water landscape and water use under the main area.\nEDIT: Looking at pictures with daylight where you can try to estimate the high of the ship using containers I would say the waves where handwavingly 4 containers high so ~9.5m and it also looks like the ship might have embedded half of the pillars fundament into/under itself (but it's a bit hard to tell to the angle of the picture). I think if that's the case probably the huge majority of bridge pillars of past and presence would have collapsed.",

          "description": "Somehow I find it surprising how completely the bridge collapsed after the damage. I understand that a container ship collision is serious, but you could imagine a scenarios where the bridge slumps or buckles but doesn’t just disintegrate like that. It’s surprising that ships capable of doing this damage were probably regularly driving past it, and its safety as a thoroughfare depended entirely on those collisions not happening.\nDoes anyone know if modern construction standards would require more stability after a ship collision, or is this still how we build bridges?",

          "description": "I'll share a lengthy anecdote (from CO, not OH), of how absurd these suspensions can get in strange edge-cases. Also, i think this shows how most processes have \"bugs\", but people don't think of them that way when it isn't in software.\nOne day, while helping someone get their car out of an impound, i was informed by the officer on duty that my license was not showing as valid. They couldn't tell why though, said the status/notes listed made no sense to her, and i should contact the Denver office to find out what is going on. I was rather confused, as it had been many years since i had last been pulled over, for a minor speeding ticket.\nDenver was similarly confused by the details. After some research, they tell me what appears to have happened was i paid my ticket years ago by check, in person. They recorded they received the check on time, but either due to a clerical error or something (they aren't sure), a late fee was assessed on my ticket prior to the payment being processed. The fee was, i think, $5.\nAround this same time, i moved, and while i changed my address with the USPS, i didn't with the DMV. The DMV was thus sending my \"you owe us $5\" letters with \"Do Not Forward\" instructions via the USPS, who were knowingly delivering the mail to the wrong address (my old place).\nWhen i discovered all of this, years later, my license had been suspended for 54 weeks due to delinquency. In CO, if your license has been suspended for over 1 year, you may not just satisfy the debt, you must also retake your driving test. But since i didn't take my original test in CO, i would also need to re-apply for a permit and pass a written permit exam before being allowed to schedule my drivers test.\nThe poor lady i spoke with in the Denver office recognized the sheer absurdity of everything she was telling me, but could do nothing to fix it. She also let me know the outstanding debt was now $15.",
