When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.",

My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.\nPseudoephedrine is very effective.

Eclipse had QNX as a target. GCC and most of the Gnu command line tools could be built for QNX.\nThere was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.\nAll of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.\nThen, in 2007, QNX went open source.

I'm currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather's got a mood, and it's contagious.\nI love the sound of rain. I think it's soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it's Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.\nMaybe it's just one of those days. I've done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.\nAnd so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don't quite know what to do with just yet.\nThat's all.\n83/100\nComments\n\nIt's snowing in Eastern Canada! ü§©‚ùÑÔ∏è\n-Denis\nIt‚Äôs a wet day here too.

          "description": "My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple's ads for \"Apple Intelligence\" comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly \"save the day\" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.\nThese ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nObviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect \"perfection\" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.",

The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we‚Äôd experience.\nEven as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren‚Äôt allowed to drive.\nAmerica was the place to be. We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It‚Äôs no longer the country people dream of coming to.\nToday, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded‚Äîa country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.\nI am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).\nI went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope.
