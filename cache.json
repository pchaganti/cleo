Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.",

The article itself explains that there is significant legal risk here:\n> Mitch Glazier, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, said that Johansson may have a strong case against OpenAI if she brings forth a lawsuit.\n> He compared Johansson’s case to one brought by the singer Bette Midler against the Ford Motor Co. in the 1980s. Ford asked Midler to use her voice in ads. After she declined, Ford hired an impersonator. A U.S. appellate court ruled in Midler’s favor, indicating her voice was protected against unauthorized use.\n> But Mark Humphrey, a partner and intellectual property lawyer at Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, said any potential jury probably would have to assess whether Sky’s voice is identifiable as Johansson.\n> Several factors go against OpenAI, he said, namely Altman’s tweet and his outreach to Johansson in September and May. “It just begs the question: It’s like, if you use a different person, there was no intent for it to sound like Scarlett Johansson. Why are you reaching out to her two days before?” he said. “That would have to be explained.”\n* A.K.A. \"Personality rights\": https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights",

I hate those like everyone, they are just intended to chill complaints in my opinion with enough question to scare average people without legal expertise (like me, like most devs), just like non-competes used to seemingly primarily be used to discourage looking at other jobs, separate from whether it was enforceable - note the recent FTC decision to end non-competes.\nAbout 5 months ago I had a chance to join a company, their company had what looked like an extreme non-compete to me, you couldn't work for any company for the next two years after leaving if they had been a customer of that company.\nI pointed out to them that I wouldn't have been able to join their company if my previous job had that non-compete clause, it seemed excessive. Eventually I was in meetings with a lawyer at the company who told me it's probably not enforceable, don't worry about it, and the FTC is about to end non-competes. I said great, strike it from the contract and I'll sign it right now. He said I can't do that, no one off contracts. So then I said I'm not working there.",

Sometimes it's best not to meet your heroes but Gordon lived up to the hype and then some.\nSuper gentle, generous with his time, the consummate gentleman.\nOne of my fondest memories from my startup years was enjoying dinner with Gordon and his wife in Sydney, she made the most amazing cookies. To this day I don't think I have had a better cookie haha.\nVisited the computer history museum with him once for a bit of a VIP tour I guess. So many stories about PDPs and all the friends he made along the way.\nThanks for all the stories and memories old man, you have earned your rest.\nRIP.",

          "description": "In the fall, I'll be moving to a new city to pursue graduate studies. I thought it'd be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.\nNext week I'm flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it'll be just me, in a new city. I'm excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I'm really on my own.\nI moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it's time for me to leave; I've been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I'm in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).\nIt's a big step, despite something I'm excited for. Yet very scary. But if I'm scared to do it, it's exactly because I'm scared that I should do it.\nI think I'm ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.\nThe (paper) journal I've kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It's as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.\nI'll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?",

          "description": "You really shouldn't have to write your own Anki cards today.\nThere's a really common sentiment that using pre-made or llm generated decks can't replace creating your own.\nThis is probably true. Writing your own flashcards forces you into a state where you have to actually think and organize the concepts together in your head into things that are digestible.\nOften the flashcards that people create are not conducive to review. It's hard to create cards that aren't easy to remember the \"shape\" of later on instead of actually remembering the content. And drilling one small piece of the puzzle doesn't fill in the rest of the pie.\nLLMs are sophisticated enough now to generate variations on flashcards on-demand. But nobody has wired up LLMs natively with spaced repetition for learning. It seems like everyone has stopped at \"generate 100 flashcards for me based on this pdf,\" which does result in flashcards that aren't going to help you remember things.",

          "description": "The fundamental selling point of all productivity advice is getting more done in less time. It's a good hook. I have over the years consumed a lot of content around productivity. It took me a long time to realise I was making a fundamental mistake.\nI assumed I would stumble upon some specific protocol that I can follow perfectly and my life is set. So I have tried it all. All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.\nThe fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.\nThis realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.\nHow to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming. I have given a framework I follow for this in my 'Hacking Hardwork' post.\nThere is no golden technique that will save you. Only you can save yourself.",

Thanks to the YouTube algorithm, I discovered a gem of a series called Ranking of Kings. I was drawn in by the beautiful animation style and the intriguing premise of a deaf-mute boy named Bojji aiming to become king. On a whim, I started the first episode. Right from the opening scenes, I got engrossed in this fantastical yet grounded world. Bojji's kind spirit shone through despite his adversity. By the end of the episode, I was already invested in his journey. I'm now 11 episodes into the first season and loving every minute. His bond with Kage also struck a chord. All the other characters are so compelling, too, even the ones I initially disliked. The animation by studio WIT is also a visual treat.",

Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.\nAs of late, I've been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I've been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn't really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.\nThis built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.\nSo once again, here we go!\n1. As a note, the \"Fucktopia\" is a reference to Souillon's comic book \"Hello Fucktopia\". Couldn't find a listing in English, sorry! It's available in French & Spanish, at least..\nMy small rules of writing\nTry to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.\nFocus! I'm super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.\nNo stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let's keep this place as my comfy Internet place.\nLet's hope it goes well. And I hope you'll enjoy this blog and its topics.\nFan-art of Cyberpunk Bartender Action: VA-11 HALL-A, by rnna_7",

Something you would pay good money to see. A smart generalist is kinda like that.\nA smart generalist is a person who is 80/20 across multiple fields. This means they have reached 80 Percent understanding/capability across multiple fields leveraging around 20 percent of the effort that would typically be needed to fully master it. It makes them unique.\nThe primary skill of a smart generalist is the ability to get from 0 to 80 in a new field quickly. They can quickly identify high ROI leverage points of a subject. It is a learned skill. They also have strong convictions that anything can be learned and learned fast. Even things considered 'tough' by society.\nOn the other hand, we have the cracked specialists. People really good at one thing. Getting to the frontiers and advancing human knowledge. Creating absolutely beautiful works in that 'one thing'.\nIt is a sliding scale. We all lie somewhere between a specialist and a generalist. But we could all do some good to realise we are not limited. We can do multiple things if we want to. It is easy to be hemmed in. To define your identity as 'Software Engineer' or 'Writer' or 'XYZ'. That is what school teaches -'Specialisation'. But humans are versatile. We are the OG general intelligence. Capable of adapting and doing multiple things.\nDon't forget the 'General' in General Intelligence.",

          "description": "(This open letter is inspired by a post I read yesterday by Gabby of woolgathering fame.)\nDear Gabby,\nIt’s not just you: getting over the fear of expectations is hard. I still struggle with it, after 300 something posts. I have a feeling I’ll never get completely over it, but here’s what’s helped me so far.\nPosting a lot helps. I’ve posted so much nonsense on this blog that these days there’s not much I can do that will be worse than something I’ve written before. Somehow, I still have regular readers. Realizing that there are people out there still interested in what I have to say after all the good and not so good is a great comfort. From what you write, you seem to have discovered as much.\nAnother perk of having a large body of work is that each new piece you create becomes a smaller and smaller part of your entire oeuvre. When you’re first starting out, it feels like each creation you put out defines you. After all, if you only have one post, it’s the only thing people can judge you on. If you have a hundred, a wayward post is a drop in the bucket.\nThat said, wouldn’t you still want to see the creations your friends or favorite creators aren’t proud of? Or see their art even if it doesn’t quite fit the niche they’ve carved out for themselves? Everybody half-asses things in their own unique way. There’s a beauty in doing things imperfectly, too.\nAll that is to say, keep up what you’re doing. Creative inertia is a very real thing. You’re doing the right thing by posting, even if you feel like you’re just posting to break the streak of inactivity. Writing in any form begets more writing.\nAnyway, welcome back to Bear! It’s good to have you back.\nYours,\nmisu",

By 1804, they abolished slavery, expelled the French colonizers, and established the independent republic of Haiti. Haiti was the name given to the Caribbean island by the Tainos before colonizers arrived, slaughtered the entire indigenous population, and imported African slaves. \n While the 1776 and 1789 revolutions of the USA and France were grounded in exclusionary “citizens’ rights,” the Haitian Revolution stood out for a com…",

Very few now find a vista of work and production at all liberatory. \n As the smell of this false and rotting order rises to the heavens, registering an unprecedented toll on all living beings, faith in the whole modern world evaporates.
