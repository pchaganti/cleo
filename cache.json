We do not recognize Putin’s view of NATO as a beast with encircling claws. At the same time, Russians can be forgiven for thinking that the Western narrative is not quite as defensive as it seems. “The spread of our values makes us safer” declared Tony Blair in Chicago in 1999, justifying NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia. This sets out the ground for forcible regime change when the opportunity offers. The underlying message is that democracy is the peaceful, dictatorship the warlike form of the state, so a war for democracy is necessarily a war for peace. Many Western analysts view the war in Ukraine as a war for regime change in Russia, which is why they cannot contemplate anything less than a Ukrainian victory.

And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done \"ahead of time\" and look good.\nNow, I've had good managers who totally didn't need this strategy, and I loved 'em to death.

You have to get an extension to get the full experience.\nThis isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.\n- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable.

They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.\n2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.\nSo that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”",

Quit it. Put it away and move on. There are too many incredible books waiting to be read to waste time on ones you don’t enjoy. If there’s one thing that can destroy your joy of reading, it’s forcing yourself to read through books you don't like. Think back to the books you were forced to read in school.

I've tried to start this book many times before, but I always stopped in the first chapter or so because I felt that the author was being unnecessarily airy and, more importantly, he directly claimed that he ended up in this semi enlightened state but doesn't rightly know how he got there. This point was the point where I always stopped, but this time I decided to power through it, and in doing so I discovered I've been missing an important part: after not knowing what had happened, and just living in a state of present bliss, Eckhart discovered that what had happened to him is what many religions aim as their ultimate goal, so he went on to discover more about that and how a normal person might get to his state, but told from hi…",

Sure, I probably spent more time than I should have on the internet, but at least I wasn't carrying it around with me. I wasn't surfing the web on my bathroom breaks or while standing in line at the grocery store. The internet was a tool, not a conqueror of my attention.\nFor years, I've talked about wanting to set up a desktop or a designated computer space. Some place where I have go and sit down in order to log on. A place where I'll keep my computer off and give myself a few seconds to decide whether looking up an actress in some random sitcom episode is truly worth the effort. I want to add a little friction to my computing and just see how my mental health responds. Will I feel better? Will my attention improve? These are the questions I'm curious about.\nBeing that I have a little free time on my hands, I thought now is as good of a time as ever to give this a shot. So, starting tonight at midnight, I'm disconnecting. For the next week, my MacBook will live on my dining room table. I'm uninstalling most of the apps that I use on my phone to make it as bare-bones as possible. My iPad will remain on, but with the Wi-Fi turned off. I have a lot of magazines downloaded courtesy of Archive.org and some books I plan to read with my free time.\nI wonder how my browsing habits will change if I don't have a piece of technology at my fingertips. Will I feel compelled to keep up with as much, or will I just find other mindless activities to fill my time? Heck, I even wonder if I'll make it the whole week. But these are the questions I will hopefully have an answer to around this time next week. With that being said, if anyone needs to contact me e-mail is going to be your best bet, because I'm sure I'll check that, but I'm probably going to miss a lot elsewhere.\nReply via email",
