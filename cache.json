Devastated by a huge flood in 1941, the City of Porto Alegre used Dutch technology to construct a huge dike, floodgate and pumping station system in the 1960s to prevent a similar tragedy from every happening again. As the water level in the Guaíba River surpassed the 3-meter mark during the first days of May, the public found out that some of the flood gates were missing rubber seals and bolts, and many had rusted into their tracks.

          "description": "Global capitalism has produced multiple intersecting crises that are intensifying conflict between and within states. These crises are a global economic slump; sharpening interimperial rivalry between the United States, China, and Russia; climate change; unprecedented global migration; and pandemics, of which COVID-19 is only the most recent example. These crises have undermined the political establishment, caused political polarization in most countries of the world, opening the door to the Right and the Left, and triggering waves of explosive yet episodic struggles from below. We have not witnessed such a period of crisis, conflict, wars, political instability, and revolts in decades.

Nevertheless, a narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system. Some market participants have similarly linked the apparent increase in official demand for gold in recent years to a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.",

It's not unusual to chair or \"run\" a non-profit and have a regular job, non-profits are actually set up to make this easy to do. If that non-profit somehow mystically turned into a for-profit enterprise, for a multitude of reasons (some less obvious) I would have clearly had to pick one or the other. If said non-profit had commercialized transformer as a service, I'd have quit DigitalOcean (double so if I was well vested).\nJust to make it fair with the situation: I honestly don't know if I would have proactively quit one or the other. Depending on the workloads, I may very well have tried to moonlight both for a while, I'm unsure.\nI don't think this tweet by Paul is weird at all.",

          "description": "Worked on two GraphQL projects; I was quickly cured from the hype. I recognize a lot of points in this article.\nIn both these projects the GraphQL had started small. I came in during a more mature phase of these projects (2 and 4 years). That's where the requirements are harder, more specific, and overall complexity has grown. Adoption and demand on the API were growing quickly. Hence you logically spend more time debugging, this is true for any codebase.\nBut GraphQL has everything in it to make such problems even harder. And both these projects had clear signs of \"learning-on-the-go\" with loads of bad practices (especially for the N+1 problem). Issue descriptions were much vaguer, harder to find in logs and performance issues popped up in the most random places (code that had been running and untouched for ages).\nFun fact; in both these projects the original devs who set it up were no longer involved. Probably spreading their evangalism further elsewhere.\nRPC and REST are just more straightforward to monitor, log, cache, authorize and debug.",

          "description": "This seems silly. It’s been obvious even to casual observers like myself for years that Waymo/Google was one of the only groups taking the problem seriously and trying to actually solve it, as opposed to pretending you could add self-driving with just cameras in an over-the-air update (Tesla), or trying to move fast and break things (Uber), or pretending you could gradually improve lane-keeping all the way into autonomous driving (car manufacturers). That’s why it’s working for them. (IIUC, Cruise has pretty much also always been legit?)\nDon’t even get me started on the “didn’t take psych 102: Attention and Memory”-level cluelessness required to believe a human can safely pay attention well enough in a vehicle that reliably tricks you into believing it’s autonomous to take over in the split seconds before a disaster…\nI find it hard to believe that the Tesla and Auto Manufacturer positions aren’t knowingly deceptive. I mean, what are they going to say? “It’s too hard so we’re just waiting for Waymo or Cruise to license their tech once it works”?\nI’m gonna stop here before I start mocking geohot… I seriously can’t believe the journalists who wrote those early stories were willing to risk their lives like that…",

          "description": "Reminds of of the replacement of \"threeks\" at the UW-Madison campus in the 1980s. At the time, it was common for satirical parties to win student elections and do odd things like cover the campus with plastic flamingos. One of the satirical parties was upset that the UW-Madison cafeteria didn't have true forks (with four tines) but only \"threeks\" (forks with three tines). So they decided to work with friends at Northwestern university outside Chicago to trade their cafeteria's forks for UW's threeks. They were successful, but obviously both UW's and Northwestern's administration weren't pleased and the trade was reversed.",

Generations of kids survived without their parents needing to know their location at all times.\nAnd yes, I totally admit, some kids (very few actually depending on the locale) didn't survive. But we've traded this false sense of \"safety\" for kids that are so risk averse it is seriously negatively affecting their development. I highly recommend the writings of Jonathan Haidt - he not only has great arguments but also has a lot of data to back up his conclusions.\nKids don't need more tech, they need less of it (and FWIW, most adults, too).",

          "description": "This mindset assumes that the only measure of success is monetary. If he left Google to try and get richer than staying at Google, then sure, he probably lost.\nHowever, he kept trying again before job hunting or returning to big tech. This tells me the monetary factor was smaller than something else.\nYou mention the underrated educational experience in your last sentence, but there's so much more than that. He was probably never worried about his autonomy, being laid off, working with (or for) people he didn't want to work with, corporate politics, or anything else corporate bureaucracy introduces. This likely freed up his brain to be more creative and actually be used to 100% of its capacity.\nI believe the obsession with TC in tech is highly problematic and there are a lot of talented folks optimizing for promotions via internal politics, rather than solving real problems for real people.\nI also wish healthcare wasn't tied to employment, but that's a post for another time.",

The bad news: I could hear so well I was unable to differentiate sound; my hearing hadn’t gotten worse, my brain’s ability to separate sound had.

It's often been said that the board (of any company) has basically one job: to hire (and fire) the CEO. While that may be a slight exaggeration, the wisdom behind that quote is that things turn out badly when the board meddles in decisions of a company's executive leadership - if they don't like the decisions being made, they should replace the CEO, and that's where their power lies.\nYou talk about \"filing formal complaints\" - what does this even mean?? They're the board, who else would they file formal complaints to? \"Hand off Sam's responsibilities to other people\"?? Again, any corporate governance expert would say that's a recipe for disaster, never mind not even feasible the way corporate hierarchies work.\nI've commented many times before that I think the way the board handled the Altman's filing was, at best, woefully naive, and their communication at the time (even after he was fired) abysmal. But neither do I think it was some sort of \"coup\", and your recommendations simply don't make sense.",

It had such high latency and packet loss, that a watchdog timer I'd implemented on the stations was timing out.\nFortunately, the remote access we'd built into our stations (SSH and OpenVPN) still worked, albeit at slow speeds, like a 300 baud dialup, and crazy-high latency.\nHaving occasionally dealt with performance a bit like that as a kid, and knowing my way around Linux, it was like \"I've been training my whole life for this moment.\"\nSo I just flexed the old command-line-and-editor-when-you-feel-every-byte-transmitted skill, and got the stations working, before the factory even knew about the submarine cable, saving our infinite-9s uptime.\nIt was nothing compared to what NASA does, but terminal animation effects would've ended both of our missions.",

I wake up, do what I have to do to keep my scholarship and my body in decent condition, and go to sleep. Repeat. My days have a rhythm I don't necessarily enjoy, because college life is the same stressful day over and over again, with a little respite here and there. And it's like, God, I'm 20 years old. I should be at the club.\nBut life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don't know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it's the fact that I don't have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend.

Who determines what makes someone \"mediocre\" or an \"A+\"? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed \"mediocre\" is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.\nExcellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don't just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of \"A+ folks.\" The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.\nPerhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...\n and I've all fallen for the bait.",

The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.\nDuring these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.\n\"Dump it\" is a self-discovery journey where I try to turn months of introspection and café conversations into concise paragraphs, backed by research.",

Chimpanzee obsession, humans as biological boot-loaders for AI, and looking at people as babies.\nThe last one is a powerful idea. Basically in your day-to-day interaction when someone is being really difficult and mean, the first instinct is to be mean back to them. To put out the fire with fire. It never works out. A great idea is to pause and visualise them as babies. I personally visualise them as little kids throwing a fit.\nHow do you deal with such kids? You are gentle and firm as the situation requires. Maybe discipline them in the right way if needed. Look at their viewpoint and try to align incentives. Maybe you are in the wrong?\nThe point is, if a little kid is mean to you, you don't take it personally. People (generally) are not mean to little kids back out of spite. You don't hold grudges against them.\nIt is an awesome framework that does wonders for your peace of mind. Do give it a shot.",

Yet, I do not really like instagram.\nAlthough I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.\nBut it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.\nLuckily I've found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn't get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.\nIt is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.\nRight now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I'm still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.\nI found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I'm addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :') )\nIf you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it.

It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.\nThis wasn't the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.\nMy writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don't feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.\nAll of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.\nThe last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.",

All have their role to play in repression. [1]\n Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance.
