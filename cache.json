It's like independent music. You're writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.\nIt's pretty punk, actually.

          "description": "I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.\nBut there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can't help but hire you. Can't help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.\nThis is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.\nWhat happened to being that intense 'Steve Job' type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.\nIt goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level.

(Thank Frith...)\nI think we were all pretty happy to see each other. Things haven't always been this way, so I'm grateful our relationships have improved as the years go by. One of the things I don't think gets talked about enough is how important (and difficult!) the task of forgiving your parents is. Of course nothing will undo what we saw, felt, and heard as kids but (most of) our parents were just trying their best. Aren't we all? I know I would want to be forgiven if I had tried my best, even if things didn't come out exactly as I'd hoped.\nPredictably, Mom hates New York. It doesn't help that inexplicably, they chose a hotel a block away from …",

Either way, I’ve come to realize that I never did do a proper introduction on this blog, outside of my About me page. In my defense, I think what I have written on there is enough to kind of get a gist for who I am.\nBut since I’m writing a post anyways, I figured I’d say something else that doesn’t completely repeat everything written on there.\nOnline, I typically go by JC(Probably), but most people in real life call me Jedda.

It is no secret that these platforms can and have caused harm to their user's mental health (me included!), but even knowing this I've sat on my hands for years before actually taking action to remedy this situation.\nHowever, as a lot of you know, it's not easy to just drop social media cold turkey. In my opinion, I think there are a few main reasons why this is the case, and I will attempt to argue against each one in this post.\n1.

So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.\nThis isn't just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write.

I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.\nAnd when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision.

The reason for the belated start seems to be indirectly concerned with national isolationism and the slow development of capitalism in Japan. The Communist Manifesto was published 20 years before the Meiji Restoration and the first volume of Das Kapital was issued a year before the Meiji Restoration. Directly…",
