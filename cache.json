It’s unclear why. I have heard two credible claims. The first is that they were hit by a cyber-attack, but came online faster than the Israelis expected.\nThe second is that the Iranians deliberately played rope-a-dope. The first attack was largely a matter of stand-off munitions, which the Israelis have (had) very limited supplies of. The Iranians tanked that hit, counting on the fact that most military targets were underground and hardened. Then when the second attack happened, which required close in attack, the air defenses were turned on. Because they had not been compromised in the first attack (air defense use makes air defens…",

Multiple nuclear sites were hit, plus civilian targets.\nIran previously threatened that if Israel hit their nuclear program, they would hit Israel’s nuclear sites in retaliation.\nIran’s leadership are incompetent. That statement will enrage some readers and commenters, but they have allowed their allies to be taken out one by one, they have not yet launched significant retaliation, and their current actions, sending a hundred drones to attack Israel, are pathetic. It is no favor to them to pretend their strategy is working: it is clearly failing.\nThey should have had a plan for an immediate, overwhelming counter-attack.

Most of these vulnerabilities also apply to the National Guard.\nNon-violent protest has been the dogma, especially on the center-left, for generations now. It wasn’t always thus: old time unions fought pitched battles with police and in one case coal miners fought the military straight up. Blowing up buildings was not verboten, nor was assassination. The history of America is not what pansy-moderns think it is, and the same is true of Britain and Canada and so on. Our forbears did not think that letting the state beat you, shoot you, torture you, imprison you and kill you without fighting back was either virtuous or, in many cases, smart.\nModern Americans, increasingly impoverished (ave…",

There’s no question that Ukraine is losing, and that the battlefield is getting worse and worse for them.\n\nRussian forced are back within 300 kilometers of Kiev.
