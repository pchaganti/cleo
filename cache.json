But for most of my life most Western governments haven’t been all that constrained, they just acted as if they were.\nThe truth is that Western governments have mostly accomplished their goals over the last 45 years: it’s just that their ur-goal was to make the rich richer.

He chose to use cameras only, and not Lidar, against the advice of his own engineers.\nChina has robotaxis already. They work fine. They have Lidar.\nTesla is doomed. Their cars are worse than those of their competitors and more expensive. Robotaxis aren’t going to work. The only thing saving Tesla right now is 100% tariffs on Chinese autos, but even non Chinese electric cars are better and often cheaper.\nMeanwhile Musk is in a feud with Trump, Trump has threatened to remove subsidies for Musk enterprises and Musk (again, an idiot) has said Trump should go ahead. And yes, he does need those subsidies.\nThe majority of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla, and it’s days are numbered. Meanwhile Starship keeps exploding, the last time during fueling, not even after launch. There are a lot of competitors to SpaceX, and w/o NASA contracts SpaceX doesn’t look so hot either. Right now NASA is stuck with Musk, but that’s not going to last.\nMusk isn’t going to be the world’s richest man much longer.\nIf you’ve read this far, and you read a lot of my articles, you might wish to Subscribe or donate.

Because almost all writing here has been mine, historically, people often assume all posts are from me. Sean-Paul’s more of an old school blogger than I am. Remember that guest posters publish in part to give different takes than I would and I don’t pre-approve their posts, unless they’re very infrequent or new.\n(Those who remember Mandos will get this.

It piled up till it was almost four feet high, and some partial thaws meant that underneath all that snow was ice. Every time I had to walk in that direction I cursed the owners (there was an SUV that came and went, so I knew it wasn’t uninhabited.)
