Open source, and open standards. Everyone outside North America and maybe Europe is going to prefer that and those who set the standards control the tech. On top of that, American AI is frighteningly expensive: no one in the US is making any money. Every query costs more to produce than is earned, even from customers who are paying, let alone all the free accounts.\nDeepseek is much less expensive per query, however. The idea of capitalism is to, y’know, make money? There’s a limit to how much money Softbank can throw at AI if it doesn’t start providing at least some returns.\nFurther, American style AI requires massive amounts of energy. And guess…",

I used to call America “the consumer of last resort.” If you wanted to get rich, if you wanted to industrialize, if you wanted to scale, you needed the American market. Europe sold to America, Japan sold to America, South Korea sold to America and China sold to America. This requirement is why Japan was forced to sign the Plaza Accords, which basically destroyed their future. Oh, life in Japan is fine now, but it’s no longer the roaring Tiger of the 80s.\nBut America has lost its place, which is why China was able to laugh in its face when Trump tried to use tariffs against it.

It will give you a much more balanced view of the man–you’ll not be looking at him through the lens of World War Two or World War One for that matter.\nFinally, I think all of us can agree that Disney Star Wars has been 90% joke. All except for Rogue One and the recently completed season two of Andor. As the Critical Drinker says, season two is “the kind of TV your sitting on the edge of your seat in complete silence knowing this is the kind of TV that comes along once every 5-10 years.”\nI’ve re-evaluated my favorite Star Wars movies–not a single TV show, not even the silly Mandalorian makes the top five, except Andor. Obviously A New Hope is number one. Rogue One is number two, Empire Strikes Back is number three, Andor both seasons are #4 and number five is a toss up between Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.  What say you people?",

(One of them was a Christian fundamentalist, as an aside.)\nThese two diplomats are agents of a genocidal state. Their job is to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Israel so that Israel can kill more Palestinians, wipe out the last remaining hospital, torture Palestinians, rape Palestinians (including, it appears, with dogs), deliberately snipe children in the head, cause a huge famine, and turn every building in Gaza into dust.\nAnd I’ve left a number of sickening crimes out.\nSo, am I sad they are dead? No. Am I going to pretend I give a shit when someone who supports genocide winds up dead? No. Every single pious well wishing for Biden is the equivalent of wishing Petain, the leader of Vichy France, who helped the Holocaust along, a good life.\nAll of these people are knowingly involved in genocide. They have had many opportunities to stop supporting mass murder and they have refused every single one of them.\nThey are all, forgive me for using the word, evil. The bad guys. Torture. Rape. Mass murder. Deliberate killing of children.\nIt is my dream that every single one of them will eventually hang from the neck for their crimes. No exceptions. And I think it would be wise to add the corporate leadership of companies like Palantir and Microsoft, both of which are helping the genocide along.\nThis is a moral stance, but it is also a pragmatic stance. People who have gotten away with genocide once are not the sort of people anyone wise wants in their society, or in a position of power anywhere. Once could easily become twice.\nYou don’t even have to give a damn about Palestinians, you just have to have good judgment and a concern for your own neck and the lives, rectums and limbs of people you care about.\nFrom the neck.
