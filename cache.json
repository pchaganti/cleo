It may not be out of place here to point out that anti‑states are well known in the modern world, above all in what the U.S. Federal Reserve Board classifies as eleven offshore banking centers. Five such enclaves are in the Caribbean: Panama, the Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the British West Indies (Cayman Islands). Three enclaves—Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore—were founded to conduct the China trade. The remaining three are Liberia, Lebanon, and Bahrain at the mouth of the Persian Gulf—the island which Bronze Age Sumerians called Dilmun when they used it to trade with the Indus valley and the Iranian shore.

What’s eye-popping about this is that the UAW succeeded not only in the South, but also with a foreign car manufacturer – a twofer. Now as the union zooms in on a May vote by 5000 workers at Mercedes in Alabama, the larger implications of Shawn Fain’s still relatively new union presidency have become clear, namely, a change in workers’ culture in the anti-union, right-to-work South; because if the UAW racks up more wins in the region, that will alter the local political ecosystem. Politicos will find themselves in an environment that includes a growing union presence, something they have sought to extirpate for generations.

The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?",

          "description": "The U.S. housing market has had a tumultuous few years. After falling to record lows during the pandemic, the average 30-year mortgage rate rapidly increased in 2022 and 2023 and now hovers near a two-decade high of 7.2 percent. For those that locked in a low mortgage rate prior to 2022, this steep increase has significantly increased the cost of moving, as taking out a mortgage at current rates would potentially increase their monthly housing payment by hundreds or thousands of dollars, even if the amount they borrowed remained unchanged. As shown by Ferreira et al. (2011), this lock-in effect has the potential to reduce geographic mobility and turnover in the housing market and has gained the attention of  Federal Reserve leaders. In this post, we utilize special questions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys to estimate the extent to which mortgage rate lock-in is suppressing U.S. household’s moving plans.",

The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.",

Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. \nThe CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research.

          "description": "In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.",

The sectors that are currently involved in this geopolitical race include semiconductors, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Despite their growing adoption, little is known about the effect of export controls on supply chains and the productive sector at large. Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.",

The only first-class flights I've taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)\nBesides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that's just the stuff that I've benefited from personally. I know there's more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I've never heard of. He was very good to us all.\nWe've always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.

The slapstick elements (trumpet noise, squishy balls) made it come across as light-hearted, rather than an ominous display of force by a large company crushing artists' tools.\nThis idea of 'squashing all these tools down to a thin slab of glass' made sense given their somewhat unusual focus on the thinness of the device. It was a bit of a throwback to the early 2010s smartphone innovation, where the size of the devices was the yardstick by which manufacturers would outdo each other. I would charitably interpret it as an uninspired marketing team trying to spin some version of Jobs' classic \"the iPhone is simultaneously an iPod, phone and internet device\" - however the party trick is old, and nobody's impressed anymore.\nPerhaps the blowback is a sign of a wider weariness that people have accumulated towards big tech companies over the past few years, mixed with a nebulous malaise about 'AI' and what it means for the status quo and people's livelihoods.",

That happens, and might or might not be a good idea, depending.\nBut the way this story is told, it sounds like the manager/lead outright lied repeatedly up the chain of command, which is generally considered very-bad, in both healthy and unhealthy companies.\nI'll add that these things are vastly easier to armchair-quarterback.  Certainly we're all going to make mistakes, especially when put in difficult positions, and/or when overextended/fatigued.  But it helps to look at scenarios, to try to learn from them, and to think from a distance how they might've been handled better, so you're armed with that \"experience\", the next time you're tossed into a rough situation that has some similarities.",

In that city 75% of the metro lives in suburbs, drives in to downtown for work and promptly leaves. Until about 2012 or so. Urban redevelopment kicked in, adding (free!) transit, boosting retail, arts district events, a new stadium, and crucially - *massive office to housing conversion projects*.\nThere are tons of success stories like the historic Fidelity Tower at 909 Walnut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909_Walnut), a huge 35-story tower that sat vacant (creepy) for the better part of a decade and is now home to 159 units. Ditto with the Power & Light Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Power_and_Light_Bu...) (36 stories) - largely vacant for the better part of 20 years and now home to nearly 300 units. I could go on, every block has similar projects of 100+ year old buildings of nontrivial sizes that are now super unique apartments. I myself lived in the 30-story Commerce Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Tower) for a while and it was incredibly cheap to do so (~$1100/month for 750sqft 1 bed on the 14th floor), I had a 10 minute commute by foot to my office, it was awesome. Even the more squat, broad midsize banking buildings have had major success with residential conversions.\nThese kinds of conversions have been proven out when there is willpower to do so at the city level - people will move in and prices typically get competitive fast if done at scale. I've lived in SF for 4 years now and I'm convinced its a policy problem not an economic problem.",

Huge floorplate.  They had built the condo units around the edges, created a hallway, and then the inside was divided up into \"storage\" spaces.  Each condo owned the space directly across the hallway.  They were very large, and people had transformed them into offices, arcades, workshops, playrooms, theaters, etc.  You could do just about anything you wanted with the space, and because it wasn't \"living space\" you didn't have to worry so much about noise and the property taxes were lower than they otherwise would have been.\nYou can't sell it for a price that includes that space as \"living space\" either.

I was laughed at in one hipster joint for asking for a steamed or warmed cold-brew, and another one initially refused my request to warm it up saying that would make the coffee extremely sour. (It didn’t) Oh, and at least one other, maybe two, said they couldn’t warm cold brew (in view of both a steamer and microwave) or would have to charge extra (while someone’s cheaper latte was being steamed).\nReading the paper, it’s not clear whether their cold brew has lower acidity (higher pH) than the same coffee hot brewed. It does say that the sonic-brew has the same pH as the normal long-steep cold brew. I’m also curious if this cavitation/sonication brewing process is basically agitating the coffee, or doing something different, and how different it is from manually agitating a cold brew compared to letting it sit still for hours.",

Think of making a cool $30 million+ a quarter, per partner -- thanks real estate (and apparently, emergency medical services) \"investments\"!  This is a direct funnel to syphon money from the workers to the ruling class.  That's even more cash than the top brass at FAAGs make.\nHow can this phenomenon be reigned in and sorted in the medium to long-term?\nIt's a loss for everyone (99.9999%) except the miniscule quantity of winners (0.0001%, yes, that's 1 in 1,000,000 - there aren't that many large-scale P/E firms).  Housing owned by P/E couldn't be more soul sucking.  Scratch that, this applies to every case I'm aware of where P/E firms own a thing.\nAnecdote: Last month my dear old dog was suddenly very ill and I spent $12k on emergency surgery to save his sweet life.  No regrets, I'm grateful he was fixable.  But in the waiting room I did the conservative math for what the SAGE Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Redwood City, CA makes in a year (before the comparatively small overhead, tax-deductible expenses) and they are pulling in at least $30 million in this single location.  That's.. a lot, for many 20 total staff.  Also they charged me $500 for each follow-up visit, which is way more than my real life surgeon charged me earlier this year! (Even including insurance, he didn't charge much for the follow-ups to make sure I survived.)  Damn.\nFor the dog lovers out there: Doggo is alive and well, can maybe last another year or two we hope.\nBtw, who owns SAGE?  NVA, a P/E firm.\nhttps://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/sage-veterinary-centers...\nhttps://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-veterinary-...",

Israel started Internet censorship in 2017.[1] Initially it was limited to \"terror group websites, online illegal gambling, prostitution services, hard drug sales\". At the time, \"due to warnings from rights groups that the law poses a slippery slope toward additional censorship, the final version of the legislation dictates that rights groups may appeal the decisions.\"\nThen, in 2021, there was the \"Facebook bill\", authorizing very broad censorship.[2] That does not seem to have passed. It was first proposed in 2016, almost passed in 2018 [3], tried in 2021, and tried again in 2022. It doesn't seem to have passed.\nBut something new happened recently. Wikipedia has a note at Censorship in Israel: \"This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: New ban issued by the knesset on foreign media channels. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2024)\"[4]\nThe Knesset gave the government the authority to ban foreign media on April 1, 2024.[5]\nThis isn't just about preventing outside media from reporting from Israel. It keeps Israelis from viewing media the government doesn't like. Haarez has good coverage.[6]\nThe US White House press secretary issued a weak statement condemning Israel's action, but it was on April 1st and the costumed Easter Bunny overshadowed that statement.[7]\n[1] https://www.timesofisrael.com/to-tackle-online-crime-israel-...\n[2] https://www.timesofisrael.com/proposed-censorship-bill-more-...\n[3] https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-israel-nearly-destroyed-fr...\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Israel\n[5] https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israels-knesset-approve...\n[6] https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-05-05/ty-article/is...\n[7] https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/202...",

There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.\nIf I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides. Mom says my uncle was hit by a car in similar circumstances, which makes me jumpy.

Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that's how I keep the curious-me happy!\nHowever, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.\nBut but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!\nThis got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?\nI pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:\nNo slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!\nCharacters are way more interesting to me than settings. I'd rather delve into a character's life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.\nI hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that's what I prefer.\nBook length doesn't bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.\nPlus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.\nSo, these are my current reading preferences, though I'm sure they'll evolve as I read more.\nFor now, I'm sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone soon.\nRight now, I'm reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It's packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I've breezed through about ten chapters and I'm already in love with it! 🫶",

Here's the truth about living as a paradox:\nI'm drawn to happiness, sure, but I can't shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It's like there's a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I'm stuck in the middle.\nI'm not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there's a begrudging respect for the person I've become, scars and all.\nWhen I say \"I don't care,\" it's not because I'm indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It's just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.\nAttention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It's like I'm afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I'm just not used to being seen.\nI've been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I've tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.\nListening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn't. I'm great at keeping other people's secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I'd rather keep them locked away.\nSo yeah, I'm a walking contradiction. It's messy, it's confusing, but it's real. And maybe that's okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life's contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.",

Kind of like window shopping for knowledge. So I decided to check the course out. I knew nothing about it. Had no interest as well. It quickly changed. The Prof teaching it had a passion that was infectious. He would encourage doubts. If someone asked something silly he would say \"ah! it seems trivial on the face of it but reveals deeper complexities\" with a happy glint in his eyes. There were no stupid questions in his class. So I chose the teacher not the course. Going with my gut and my seniors advice against all common sense. Only 11 other people in the entire college took the course.\nI had the most fun in those classes. Learned so much. Fell in love with formal proof writing. Had my mind blown several times. The extra class hours spend absorbing the material, making my way through new proofs felt effortless.\nIt taught me a lesson that I always keep in mind. Environment matters.

I never understood smart work anyways. It assumes people are dumb and don't know how to approach problems from high leverage points.

Well the key insight is you can bore yourself to a point that anything is enjoyable. Also you can gaslight yourself into making any mundane task feel grand. So what looks like mundane paperwork to someone on the outside could feel like the holy act of putting ink on paper and rewriting history to you. You get my point right?\nEveryone has a different brain and how you programme this squishy thing will be personal to you. Just spend time with yourself.

During breakfast, they talked about how important coffee is to a scientific workplace.\nAt our institute, there is a single set of coffee machines on the top floor, set up to encourage interactions among scientists.\nWhen scientists take social breaks, it's often coded as \"coffee break\". One scientist even wrote an opinion piece encouraging more socialization in science through coffee breaks.\nThe problem is that I don't drink coffee. Honestly, I barely take in caffeine. I used to drink black tea in the morning irregularly, then I tried …",

          "description": "{{ post_description }}\nI thought that instead of typing up another rant, I'd do something a bit different. I want to share a little anecdote with you.\nAround 20 years ago, I joined the British Army; right at the height of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.\nYeah, I've never been the sharpest tool in the box.\nAnyway, Iraq was shit. I lost a couple of friends, more were badly hurt, and I myself suffered a minor shrapnel wound.\nIt's fair to say that I saw shit out there that no-one should ever see. I finished my tour of Iraq and less than a year later I found myself in Afghanistan.\nFor me, Afghan was marginally better than Iraq. I won't go into detail as to why as that could reveal who I am, but suffice to say, it wasn't quite as shit as Iraq.\nI got back from Afghan and I was fucked. Not physically though. Mentally. The Army might spin this yarn that they give their troops the help they need, but the fact of the matter is, if you went to the \"Med Centre\" claiming you were having mental health problems, you'd quickly become a laughing stock of the battalion.\nYou'd be labelled a pussy. A fanny. Not tough enough be a soldier.\nNote: This might not be the case anymore. It's been a long time since I served, but that's what it was like then I was serving.\nSo I didn't get help, and it utterly fucked me. I was having nightmares. I was taking it out on my loved ones. I was all over the show.\nThen my (now) wife convinced me to go see a professional to help me process some of this baggage.\nI did, and it really helped. Actually, it was one of the best things I've ever done. Do I still have demons? Yes. Do I let them affect my life? For the most part, no.\nSo, my message to you is - whether you're a soldier, a police officer, a fire fighter, a janitor, an office worker, or anything else - if you have shit going on upstairs, don't let it fester. Go and see someone about it. Someone impartial, who can just listen and help you process that shit.\nYou can thank me later.\nPeace. ✌️\nReply by email",
