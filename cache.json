Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.\nProfitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious.

It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let's get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I'll be switching to Bear's \"Plain HTML\" theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I'm not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!",

(I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!",

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world.

To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.\nI don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.\nI overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase\nI do a lot of recreational coding. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.\nI love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.\nI rely a lot on intuition.\nI’m not a fan of TDD.\nI value data structures over algorithms.\nI don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.\nI prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.\nI'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math\nThat's it for now :)",
