Which is pretty funny. What she in fact said was that she knew “only one person who voted for Nixon,” that the rest of them were “outside my ken,” and that she could feel their presence only sometimes “when I’m in a theater.” Which is no longer funny, just irritating. Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York. Yet, as the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in her new book, the well-publicized contempt of the elites for those they consider “hillbillies” or “rednecks” significantly contributes to our current political malaise.

American-supplied Israeli rifles and bombs have wounded more than 5,000 Palestinians in the last 13 ½ months. Notably, there have been more than 100 airstrikes; airstrikes had not happened in the West Bank in more than 20 years. 18 of the 168 killed by Israeli warplanes and drones have been children. Before October 7th, the Israeli military gunned down and killed, on average, more than one Palestinian a day. In the first ten months of 2023, Israeli soldiers murdered nearly 50 children in the West Bank. Yet, many in the US believe history started on October 7th, 2023.

          "description": "Twenty-five years ago this week, the streets of Seattle erupted into the kind of militant protest rarely seen in the US. Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink's anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom.

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with \"driver impairment\" tech which was called a \"kill switch\". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just \"sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements\" and \"block the driver from operating the vehicle\". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497\nAnyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration.

But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying \"FBO\" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.\nFWIW, after seeing \"how the sausage is made\", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.\nSee https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/11/08/what-th...",

There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed.

What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.\nSometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.",

I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam's post about social media, and it clicked for me.\nI deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.\nWhat I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I've grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I've had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.\nNow that I'm unshackled again, I'm making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I'm tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I'm doing the same for other people.",

          "description": "Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.\nAfter moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple \"hello\" while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.\nAnd wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.\nFor now, I’m enjoying my role as a \"hello-er\" and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a \"hello-er\" could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.",

He came home to report that he'd passed the homes of old friends, the middle school he attended, and various spots where he's committed various teenage sins in his wayward youth.\nA little later, we went to the train station to pick up his daughter, our granddaughter, who was traveling to meet us from Virginia, where she attends school.
