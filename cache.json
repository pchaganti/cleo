(Maybe that little Pakistan kerfuffle wasn’t cost free?)\nThis is all very amusing and instructive on a number of levels. America banned something that China could handle the bans on: semiconductors.

Financiers do things so they can get money. To a financier it doesn’t matter how money is made, so long as they won’t go to prison. All that matters is rate of return.\nA capitalist has something they want to do: Ford wanted to build cars. Edison wanted to invent. The Wright Brothers wanted to fly. They need money so they can do whatever it is that turns their crank.\nCapitalists create great societies. Financiers destroy them.\nAs soon as rate of return becomes the only consideration, a society becomes less interested in doing new things or doing old things well …",
