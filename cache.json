Reading or watching the news is a daily exercise in dread, self-torment, and exhaustion. The return of spring notwithstanding, things are grim these days. The Trumpist menace seems of a piece with a far-right axis on the march in India, Russia, Israel, China, and Hungary. Of course, it’s futile to wring one’s hands and lament Trumpian aspirations to authoritarianism without taking concrete action to prevent them. Yet despite nearly eight years of experience confronting the Trumpian specter, the answer to the traditional, eminently practical leftist question “What is to be done?” remains elusive, and the sense of burnout and political defeat—with the concomitant, complicated welter of emotions —is a specter difficult to vanquish.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post The Great Resignation appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "“Do you think ‘sit-ins’ at lunch counters, ‘Freedom Buses’ and other demonstrations by Negroes will hurt or help the Negro's chances of being integrated in the South?” This question was posed by Gallup, a leading polling organization, back in 1961, during the heyday of the Civil Rights Movement. A majority of Americans at the time, 57%, believed that the sit-ins would “hurt” the movement. They were wrong. Today, we credit the Civil Rights Movement with ending racial segregation in the United States, but we cannot disconnect its success from its tactics. Martin Luther King Jr. was no advocate of passive resistance, but a firm believer in “militant nonviolence”– a consistent torrent of protests in the form of boycotts, mass marches, sit-ins, and strikes. These are similar tactics to those that students across the world are using to spread awareness of the over 30,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and to push their universities to dissociate from the Israeli State.

Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.",

          "description": "In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rose almost simultaneously in most economies around the world. After peaking in mid-2022, inflation then went into decline—a fall that was just as universal as the initial rise. In this post, we explore the interrelation of inflation dynamics across OECD countries by constructing a measure of the persistence of global inflation. We then study the extent to which the persistence of global inflation reflects broad-based swings, as opposed to idiosyncratic country-level movements. Our main finding is that the spike and subsequent moderation in global inflation in the post-pandemic period were driven by persistent movements. When we look at measures of inflation that include food and energy prices, most of the persistence appears to be broad-based, suggesting that international oil and commodity prices played an important role in global inflation dynamics. Excluding food and energy prices in the analysis still shows a broad-based persistence, although with a substantial increase in the role of country-specific factors.",

          "description": "This morning, the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit for the first quarter of 2024. Household debt balances grew by $184 billion over the previous quarter, slightly less than the moderate growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. Housing debt balances grew by $206 billion. Auto loans saw a $9 billion increase, continuing their steady growth since the second quarter of 2020, while balances on other non-housing debts fell. Credit card balances fell by $14 billion, which is typical for the first quarter. However, an increasing number of borrowers are behind on credit card payments. In this post, we explore the relationship between credit card delinquency and changes in credit card “utilization rates.”",

This means they already had everything they needed to ship  the product with Scarlett’s  cloned voice.)\n- Not receiving a response, OpenAI demos the product anyway, with Sam tweeting “her” in reference to Scarlett’s film.\n- When Scarlett’s counsel asked for an explanation of how the “Sky” voice was created, OpenAI yanked the voice from their product line.\nPerhaps Sam’s next tweet should read “red-handed”.",

          "description": "If you like this, it's also worth looking at llama2.c[1], an implementation of the Llama 2 architecture in about 1000 lines of plain, dependency-free C, tokenizer and all. THe fact that this 960-line file and a somewhat modern C compiler is all you really need to run a state-of-the-art language model is really surprising to many.\nOf course, this is not all there is to a modern LLM, it would probably take another thousand lines or two to implement training, and many more than that to make it fast on all the major CPU and GPU architectures. If you want a flexible framework that lets a developer define any model you want and still goes as fast as it can, the complexity spirals.\nMost programmers have an intuition that duplicating a large software project from scratch, like Linux or Chromium for example, would require incredible amounts of expertise, manpower and time. It's not something that a small team can achieve in a few months. You're limited by talent, not hardware.\nLLMs are very different. THe code isn't that complicated, you could probably implement training and inference for a single model architecture, from scratch, on a single kind of GPU, with reasonable performance, as an individual with a background in programming and who still remembers their calculus and linear algebra, with a year or so of self study. What makes LLMs difficult is getting access to all the hardware to train them, getting the data, and being able to preprocess that data.",

Vulkan didn't even exist back then (and DirectX 12 had only just released) but instead of making things better, it digs it's feet even deeper into the assumption that all shaders will be known ahead of time (resulting in long \"shader recompilation\" dialogs on startup on many games).\nI've been tempted to build my own fast shader compiler into Dolphin for many common GPU architectures. Hell, it wouldn't even be a proper compiler, more of a templated emitter as all shaders fit a pattern. Register allocation and scheduling could all be pre-calculated.\nBut that would be even more insane than ubershaders, as it would be one backend per gpu arch. And some drivers (like Nvidia) don't provide a way to inject pre-compiled shader binaries.\nOn the positive side, ubershaders do solve the problem, and modern GPU drivers do a much better job at accepting ubershaders than they did 9 years ago. Though that's primarily because (as far as I'm aware) examples of Dolphin's ubershader have made their way into every single shader compiler test suite.",

Using the same insight of the estimation value of tracking whether we've hit a \"run\" of heads or tails, but flipping the idea on its head (heh), it leads to the simpler algorithm described, which is about discarding memorized values on the basis of runs of heads/tails.\nThis also works especially well (that is, efficiently) in the streaming case, allowing you to keep something resembling a \"counter\" for the distinct elements, albeit with a error rate.\nThe benefit of HyperLogLog is that it behaves similarly to a hash set in some respects -- you can add items, count distinct them, and, importantly, merge two HLLs together (union), all the while keeping memory fixed to mere kilobytes even for billion-item sets. In distributed data stores, this is the trick behind Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cardinality agg, as well as behind Redis/Redict with its PFADD/PFMERGE/PFCOUNT.\nI am not exactly sure how this CVM algorithm compares to HLL, but they got Knuth to review it, and they claim an undergrad can implement it easily, so it must be pretty good!",

At the time deviantArt made money a few ways.\nIn no particular order, because I don't know which were profitable or which represented a larger portion of revenue:\n- Subscriptions (users could pay for a few extra features and to disable ads on the site)\n- DeviantArt branded merch.\n- Prints and products with users' art printed on them\n- Sponsored Contests. These promoted movies or other media properties, or software of interest to artists. Often the prizes included Wacom tablets and Adobe Photoshop licenses.\nDuring my time there a significant problem we were dealing with was due to deviantArt's stance on adult content. Anything was allowed as long as it wasn't outright pornography.  In practice that meant that nudes were allowed but sexual acts were not. This had consequences for deviantArt's revenue. It meant that we could not run ads from the \"reputable\" ad networks and were forced to deal with seedier outfits that often (e.g. constantly) included malware in the display ads, exposing users to all sorts of nasty stuff. One of my projects was to detect and/or prevent the malware ads which proved challenging and at least given the amount of resources devoted to it, it was not very fruitful.\nIt really is sad for me to see what deviantArt has devolved into. Once the original founders sold out a few years ago I really didn't hold out much hope for the site's future.",

          "description": "> And that typed text is way, way cleaner than any typewriter I’ve seen.\nPedantic point: electric typewriters (which have existed since the 1960s) do type in a way that looks exactly like this.\n(In fact, note that the text on the real employee ID card, shown later in the article, doesn't look any less clean! It's just set in a different, narrower font.)\nThe smudginess of mechanical typewriters comes from 1. them striking (and especially, releasing) at the same speed you're depressing the key, and 2. having many of the keys necessarily approach the ribbon from an angle.\nThe keys being swung weakly by your fingers, also has the additional implication that the ink ribbons used in mechanical typewriters have to be soft and squishy (so: made of cloth), and use thin inks. These properties ensure a transfer from even a low-velocity impact. But the trade-off is that cloth ink ribbons transfer only a rough outline of what's struck; and thin inks are high-bleed inks.\nAn electric typewriter, playing out a pre-buffered line with a crisp, predictable report, using linear actuators and a rotating-ball type-head to bang a tape ribbon loaded with high-viscosity ink onto the page, can create text indistinguishable from books/newspapers of the same period, or from modern laser-printer reproductions of the same font faces. They're essentially character-at-a-time letterpresses!\n(Also, ignoring electric typewriters for a sec: inks bleed more on thin, cheap paper. But this is [a forgery of] an employee ID card — where, for durability, a nice heavyweight paper or cardstock would have been used. You're always going to get a better-looking result inking such paper.)",

          "description": "Okay... exhales\nHere we go.\nHi, I'm Meï ! And welcome to this blog. Or this attempt at a blog.\nIt's been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil' kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.\nA friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.\nI used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.\nAs of late, I've been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I've been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn't really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.\nThis built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.\nSo once again, here we go!\n1. As a note, the \"Fucktopia\" is a reference to Souillon's comic book \"Hello Fucktopia\". Couldn't find a listing in English, sorry! It's available in French & Spanish, at least..\nMy small rules of writing\nTry to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.\nFocus! I'm super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.\nNo stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let's keep this place as my comfy Internet place.\nLet's hope it goes well. And I hope you'll enjoy this blog and its topics.\nFan-art of Cyberpunk Bartender Action: VA-11 HALL-A, by rnna_7",

          "description": "(This open letter is inspired by a post I read yesterday by Gabby of woolgathering fame.)\nDear Gabby,\nIt’s not just you: getting over the fear of expectations is hard. I still struggle with it, after 300 something posts. I have a feeling I’ll never get completely over it, but here’s what’s helped me so far.\nPosting a lot helps. I’ve posted so much nonsense on this blog that these days there’s not much I can do that will be worse than something I’ve written before. Somehow, I still have regular readers. Realizing that there are people out there still interested in what I have to say after all the good and not so good is a great comfort. From what you write, you seem to have discovered as much.\nAnother perk of having a large body of work is that each new piece you create becomes a smaller and smaller part of your entire oeuvre. When you’re first starting out, it feels like each creation you put out defines you. After all, if you only have one post, it’s the only thing people can judge you on. If you have a hundred, a wayward post is a drop in the bucket.\nThat said, wouldn’t you still want to see the creations your friends or favorite creators aren’t proud of? Or see their art even if it doesn’t quite fit the niche they’ve carved out for themselves? Everybody half-asses things in their own unique way. There’s a beauty in doing things imperfectly, too.\nAll that is to say, keep up what you’re doing. Creative inertia is a very real thing. You’re doing the right thing by posting, even if you feel like you’re just posting to break the streak of inactivity. Writing in any form begets more writing.\nAnyway, welcome back to Bear! It’s good to have you back.\nYours,\nmisu",

It was mostly due to my c programming skills and research work.\nI am grateful for the role. I get to work on something I like. The people I work with are smart and kind. But it is just a job. Both to me and to the people I work with. One of the major perks that the HR department keeps repeating is a great work-life balance. You get time for yourself. That is very true.\nIsn't that great? You get paid well. Get enough time for a good social life and side projects. You can also fund these side projects with your salary.\nYes, but what about working in a startup? A place where a lot of super passionate people are going ham at what they do. To them, it is not a job but a mission. A sort of crazy cult. Filled with kind passionate nerds. Some place where you own part of the dream. Have equity.\nIt sounds nice. But such places are very rare. The startup scene in India is pretty horrible. I have heard some really bad stories. So many of the startups look cool on the outside. Have great pay even. But are horrible to work for. I have had friends experience this.\nI also feel like I am not good enough for those truly cracked places yet. So I am happy where I am for now and just Skill maxxing. I want to feel like a really capable engineer. I see so many of them at my org.

You're either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you're a woman without said dangly bits.\nBut maybe there's more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn't feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it's the opposite? Or something in between?\nHonestly, I don't give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I'll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.\nLook, it's a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We've been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there's been 2 genders. Male and female.\nBut in the last few decades there's been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as \"him\" don't get up on your high horse and start screaming \"YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!\"\nI assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that's fine. Tell me politely and I'll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.\nIrony is, if you're not a dick about the whole thing, you're far more likely to get people on-side. You're always gonna get bigoted wankers, that's par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn't make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.\nIt just makes them human.\nPeace ✌🏻\nReply by email",

Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.\nWorking on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don't like inking, I half-ass shapes I don't understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on.
