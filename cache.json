          "description": "Image by Marcel Strauß.\nAs always when a representative of the right wing tells you he or she is campaigning to bring “freedom,” be afraid. Very afraid. For “freedom” in these cases means freedom for the richest financiers and industrialists to do whatever they want.\nFor them, “Freedom” is for capital, not for human beings without capital to invest. Today’s exhibit is the offensive against working people that is taking place in Argentina, where the new extreme right president, Javier Milei, is determined to see how far capitalist ideology can be pushed. So far, Argentines have pushed back but Milei, cheered on by domestic and international big business leaders, is nothing if not determined to ram through his austerity packages. And he has shown no inclination to allow mere democracy to stand in his way.\nNonetheless, there is no surprise here. President Milei ran on a program of extreme austerity, brandishing a chainsaw at his election rallies. Unfortunately, enough Argentines bought his siren songs, or were desperate enough to try anything given the country’s punishing inflation, to elect him, ending a one-term period in executive office by the ordinarily dominant Peronists. Alas, doing something new for the sake of doing something new, when it is aimed at you, rarely works. And here there is actually nothing new. President Milei simply promoted standard hard right ideology, albeit promoting it with unusual vigor. Snake oil is snake oil, as Argentine working people are already finding out.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Capitalism Attacks Argentine Workers and You May be Next appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

As the genocide continues to unfold — claiming the lives of 35,562 Palestinians, including 15,000 children, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing — students, faculty and staff have brought overdue scrutiny to the complicity of their universities, whose endowments are altogether valued at more than $839 billion per the National Association of College and University Business Officers and invested extensively in the Israeli economy, including weapons manufacturers profiting directly from Palestinian death. Rather than accept that students oppose their tuition dollars being spent to kill Palestinians, right-wing pundits have instead accused them of being “paid protesters” in the employ of philanthropist George Soros.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Blaming Soros for Campus Protests is Anti-Semitic — Just Ask Israel appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

Perfectly syncing it is harder. Implementing echo cancellation across all of that is quite a bit trickier than regular single-device echo cancellation.\nBut then treating all the laptop microphones as a kind of microphone array, having to deal with sync issues and phase issues and background noise issues... that's hard core.\nKudos to the engineering team on this one.

          "description": "As far as I can tell, the issue with this is:\nOP runs a casino/gambling site.  Gambling is a regulatory mess (I have spent far too long dealing with this as an RNG supplier), and so it's very hard to comply with every jurisdiction, and each one needs you to prove compliance to operate in that jurisdiction.*  Gaming companies spend a lot on compliance and tracking, but since the internet is the internet, it's pretty hard to enforce perfectly, so some countries and ISPs take this into their own hands.\nDue to that, IPs hosting gambling and gaming sites often get regionally blocked by internet providers or otherwise flagged as hosting illegal content.  Those regional blocks consequently affect the reputation score of the IP, and if you are a traffic aggregator like Cloudflare, can cause other customers to have issues.  One of the most aggressive and annoying regulatory environments for gambling companies is the US, so it's very possible Cloudflare has had some trouble due to gambling use of their IPs in states in the USA.\nCloudflare wanted them to use the BYOIP features of the enterprise plan, and did not want them on Cloudflare's IPs. The solution was to aggressively sell the Enterprise plan, and in a stunning failure of corporate communication, not tell the customer what the problem was at all.  The message from Cloudflare should have been \"Enterprise plan + BYOIP or ban, and maybe we'll work with you on price\" but it was instead \"you would really like the Enterprise plan.\"\n*As an aside - we're lucky in that respect being a tech supplier with relatively uniform rules, but our customers (the gaming companies) get the short end of the stick here.",

She struggled a lot until she finally got the attention that she needed from a teacher who was able to instruct her in sign language (which believe you or not is Brazil's second official language). Before that she told us she was not able to have complex thoughts. She didn't know her father had a name, for instance. She thought his \"name\" was daddy.

When you do +1, all the trailing 1's flip AGAIN, becoming zero like they were in x. The next highest 0 (say it was the n'th) also flips, becoming 1... like it was in x.\n5. Crucial observation: The n'th 0 did NOT match the corresponding bit in x prior to the increment, therefore it MUST match after the increment. All higher bits stay as-is.\n6.

But one problem was so glaring that the team wasn't comfortable releasing Froogle: when the query \"running shoes\" was typed in, the top result was a garden gnome sculpture that happened to be wearing sneakers. Every day engineers would try to tweak the algorithm so that it would be able to distinguish between lawn art and footwear, but the gnome kept its top position. One day, seemingly miraculously, the gnome disappeared from the results. At a meeting, no one on the team claimed credit. Then an engineer arrived late, holding an elf with running shoes. He had bought the one-of-a kind product from the vendor, and since it was no longer for sale, it was no longer in the index. \"The algorithm was now returning the right results,\" says a Google engineer. \"We didn't cheat, we didn't change anything, and we launched.\"'\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14009245",

          "description": "I will forever treasure my ICQ memories.\nThe sounds it made. The moving image when it was connecting. Listening in Winamp to one of only a few dozen possible songs that I had carefully downloaded.\nBeing able to randomly connect to people you would filter. Yes, I want to talk to someone more or less my age but in Iceland. Or any other country.\nBut most of all, the feeling of being connected. As a teenager in the autism spectrum, that was one of the best feelings I had at that time.\nMost people don’t get it when I say this, maybe someone here will, but to me it all started going downhill when people all of a sudden switched to a worse alternative, MSN. I see a direct line from there to the annoying easy-to-accept-while-hard-to-reject-but-always-there-anyway cookie pop-ups.\nAnd no, this is isn’t some form of Ostalgie where we long for past days of hardship with tender feelings. ICQ just had a great user experience as far as I am concerned and to this day I prefer it to existing alternatives from WhatsApp to Webex chat (don’t mention Teams please, I’m having a poetic moment). It was rather a feeling that perhaps other Brazilians will share: a longing, saudade, for the simpler (yes) but better and more poetic 90s, when ICQ connected you to a world that watched Brazil win the fourth World Cup, Ayrton Senna was inspiring generations to be healthier and their better selves and Mamonas Assassinas could only make us laugh, not cry…\nSo long, ICQ. You will always be part of why I love the internet.\nPS: I realize the timing of those events doesn’t necessarily align. But sentimentally they do.",

          "description": "Given the level of impact that this incident caused, I am surprised that the remediations did not go deeper. They ensured that the same problem could not happen again in the same way, but that's all. So some equivalent glitch somewhere down the road could lead to a similar result (or worse; not all customers might have the same \"robust and resilient architectural approach to managing risk of outage or failure\").\nExamples of things they could have done to systematically guard against inappropriate service termination / deletion in the future:\n1. When terminating a service, temporarily place it in a state where the service is unavailable but all data is retained and can be restored at the push of a button. Discard the data after a few days. This provides an opportunity for the customer to report the problem.\n2. Audit all deletion workflows for all services (they only mention having reviewed GCVE). Ensure that customers are notified in advance whenever any service is terminated, even if \"the deletion was triggered as a result of a parameter being left blank by Google operators using the internal tool\".\n3. Add manual review for any termination of a service that is in active use, above a certain size.\nAbsent these broader measures, I don't find this postmortem to be in the slightest bit reassuring. Given the are-you-f*ing-kidding-me nature of the incident, I would have expected any sensible provider who takes the slightest pride in their service, or even is merely interested in protecting their reputation, to visibly go over the top in ensuring nothing like this could happen again. Instead, they've done the bare minimum. That says something bad about the culture at Google Cloud.",

It's way faster and more responsive than any e-ink screen and it's way less addicting than the typical laptop, phone or tablet.\nI'm attempting to make this device my main driver over the next few months and while the ecosystem isn't exactly mature yet, most android apps just work out of the box and I've found myself doing a lot more reading, either through an e-reading app (Lithium), PDF reader or Instapaper.

I get that a lot of us have privacy concerns. I get that maybe you don't want it in your terminal emulator.\nBut iTerm is a free (both as in gratis and as in libre) open source project. The developer released a feature that they were probably happy and excited about. It was off by default and didn't siphon data or do anything malicious. And a ton of reactions were as if iTerm had just added the devil incarnate or attacked people personally.\nDisliking the feature is fine. Voicing your concerns and feedback is fine. But it should always be gracious and in good faith. I think this is a good change, if only to pacify the masses, and I applaud the developer for taking these steps, but I don't like how we got here.\nEDIT: gnachman, if you're reading this, thank you for your tireless work on iTerm. It serves me extremely well whenever I'm on macOS and holds a special place in my heart. I bought a MacBook in 2013 and it was the first *nix system that I daily drove as a desktop for a long time.

Long time lurker, so this is pretty cool to finally take part :)\nI made this because I wanted the eye-strain free and minimalist qualities of my kindle/Eink applied to so much more of what I do on a computer.\nLack of speed and ghosting felt like it made traditional Eink impossible to do most computing tasks. So we focused on making the most Paperlike epaper display that has no ghosting and high refresh rate - 60 to 120fps. We started working on this in 2018.\nWe developed our own custom epaper display tech we call LivePaper. We focused on solving the tradeoffs RLCDs traditionally have - around reflectance %, metallic-look / not Paperlike enough, viewing angle, white state, rainbow mura, parallax, resolution, size, lack of quality backlight, etc.\nFirst proof of concept in late 2021, and then it took us 2.5 years to get it into production.\nAnd we built a whole android tablet around it.\nIt’s essentially our attempt at making a remarkable tablet on steroids / kindle on steroids. Definitely some trade offs, but on the whole we think it’s worth it. (& on twitter a bunch of early customers seem to think so too)\nNote: it’s 60fps epaper, not off the shelf Eink. We spent years developing what we think is the best epaper display in the world and it’s exclusively manufactured by our display factory in Japan.\nThere’s still many cases where traditional Eink is going to be better (bistability, viewing angle, white state color, etc), but we feel for more general purpose computers you can code on and do google docs on and do fast multitouch amongst a thousand other things, the speed and lack of ghosting totally makes it worth it.\nThink of it as a Godzilla sized pebble watch with a decade of improvement\nOr think of it as a gameboy advanced, advanced",

They can just show that those records didn't mention it. The key decision-makers could simply have agreed to keep that fact close-to-the-vest -- they may have well understood that knocking off a high-profile actress was legally perilous.\nAlso, I think we can readily assume OpenAI understood that one of their potential voices sounded a lot like SJ. Since they were pursuing her they must have had a pretty good idea of what they were going after, especially considering the likely price tag. So even if an SJ voice wasn't the original goal, it clearly became an important goal to them. They surely listened to demos for many voice actors, auditioned a number of them, and may even have recorded many of them, but somehow they selected one for release who seemed to sound a lot like SJ.",

Actually, I don't know if it's difficult, if I'm afraid, or if I just lack courage, despite many people saying that fear is the absence of courage, so this might be redundant.\nI always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor...

I'm hoping to hear more queer voices, too.\nto my dear friends who actually read my blog, I hope you guys will come on here one day, too. I think you're all so wonderful anyway, and I love to read more from you guys.\nthank you to all the now-strangers that are also reading this blog, I really appreciate you and the grace you've given me to feel more welcomed on this website. if you like it here, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter <3\nlove love love you guys! byeeee~\nReply via email\nsubscribe to the newsletter so you never have to miss a post ᯓ★",

Yet, I do not really like instagram.\nAlthough I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.\nBut it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.\nLuckily I've found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn't get something rights at first.\nIt is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.\nRight now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I'm still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.\nI found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I'm addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :') )\nIf you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.\nFor now, it is what it is.   ¯\\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯\nHere is one of the songs I listened to while writing this post",

If you don't have strong convictions you will find yourself going wherever the next opinionated and charismatic person you meet points you.  But it is important to choose them wisely.\nWhat if your conviction is that penguins can fly, they only need the right motivation? So you spend your life trying to give motivational speeches to penguins. Hoping one of them will fly. You will even meet people with similarly strong convictions. Form a strong community. Make derogatory memes about the 'others' who believe in things like the 'scientific method' and so on.\nAnd your ego attaches itself tightly to your penguin motivator persona. So anyone trying to challenge you is attacking you and your community. So you viciously attack this person back. Congratulations. You are now in a toxic pointless echo chamber.\nThe only solution is selecting convictions using first principles. Employ the scientific method. Be open to being challenged as long as the challenge comes through solid first principles thinking as well. All the while keeping the ego in check.\nSo in essence develop an egoless conviction.

Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress \"wisdom\" into a handful of tweets and blog posts.\nMost Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval's entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it's usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.\nSometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don't need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.",

No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don't need the negativity in your life.\nHere the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context.

I thought it'd be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.\nNext week I'm flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it'll be just me, in a new city. I'm excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I'm really on my own.\nI moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it's time for me to leave; I've been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I'm in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).\nIt's a big step, despite something I'm excited for. Yet very scary. But if I'm scared to do it, it's exactly because I'm scared that I should do it.\nI think I'm ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.\nThe (paper) journal I've kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately.

All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.\nThe fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.\nThis realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.\nHow to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming.

At least smokers are committing, knowing they're gonna kill themselves, have decided to enjoy it while they're here.\nBut you mouth dildo fuckers are the worst. We don't want to smell your stupid fucking vape. So put it away because you look (and smell) like a dick head.\nPeace ✌🏻\nReply by email",

          "description": "Back in the glory days of the internet, when social media was just becoming mainstream, I used to blog regularly. I would write and publish a post anywhere from 1 - 3 times a week.\nI didn't monetize my blog and I had no dreams of my personal site becoming a business. It was simply a place for me to share things that were on my mind and lessons learned from books I was reading.\nFast forward many years and what we have is the current state of the internet.\nEverything is an ad. Everyone is an influencer. And the algorithms determine what we see and dictate what we post. And for some reason they insist on the entire population becoming video producers.\nIt's an endless game that I lost my taste for long ago.\nThat's why I'm attempting to blog again. I need somewhere to get my thoughts and opinions out without distraction and without too much tech.\nIf the internet stresses you out as much as it does me, might I suggest starting your own blog?\nOr heck, maybe just quit the social internet altogether.",

But when I finally got there, it only got worse. \n The people who sheltered me sincerely did not understand why I did not want to defend the country with weapons in my hands. My hope to go to Europe seemed like a betrayal to them. At the same time, I had to hide from them not only my fear, but also my culture and my orientation. \n These same people advised me to voluntarily join the territorial defense. Their acquaintances, who also didn’t want to fight, deliberately signed up there so they wouldn…",
