          "description": "Getting elites attention\n\nWhat the right wants from its followers is for them to be riven by hatred of any difference, thus making them easy to manipulate and willing to sell out their economic values in exchange for seeing brown people beaten, and women and trans people losing control over their own bodies.\nWhat neoliberals want is for their followers to be convinced that each group, even each micro group, is on its own, unable to understand each other and thus that solidarity is impossible and all one can hope for is that some member of the identity group is allowed to join the elite, while most of all groups remain in poverty.\nThey’re very similar, really. In both cases hatred of other groups is inculcated as the core value, as a way of making manipulation easy and avoiding having to actually deal with broad issues of well being.\nBoth of these are variations on “divide and conquer”. It costs a lot less to give a few people something than to give many people something. “Want some women and minorities in power? Sure. Costs us almost nothing.”\n“Want women to be forced to bear rape children and die in pregnancy due to lack of necessary abortions? Sure, costs us nothing. Our women can still get abortions.\n“Want trans people excluded and denied health care? Sure, they’re a tiny part of the population and rich trans people will be fine.”\nOn the other hand giving everyone healthcare would cut a lot of profits. Giving everyone a liveable wage or assistance to those who can’t work or find jobs: that would cost a lot of profits.\n“You can have anything you want, as long as it doesn’t make elites poorer.”\nOn that the right and center are unified.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

          "description": "Stumbled on this chart recently:\n\nKind of tells its own story.\nIt’s worth reading the Communist manifest. People have weird ideas about it, but a lot of it is really unexceptionable. For example, Marx and Engels demanded pensions for old folks.\nCapitalists looked at this and said, “oh, we can do this if the alternative is worse” and introduced them. Someone as hard headed as Bismarck responded this way.\nThe threat of a credible enemy ideology which treats ordinary people better than capitalists do forces capitalists to change. For a long time we haven’t had that, but the single party “Marxist but with capitalism” CCP offers another, and yes, they do, overall treat their workers better, as well as being better at capitalism than capitalists. No one is as obsessed with how markets actually work as Marxist economists.\nLet’s look at another of my favorite charts:\n\nOh hey, having powerful organizations taking the part of workers matters.\nSomething happened right after Reagan took power:\n\nStrikes involving more than 1,000 workers\n\nThen there’s this:\n\n(The numbers have gone down since then, but are still vastly high, and far, far higher than China.\nBreak the unions and lock up the people who won’t obey bullshit (aka. drug) laws.\nClass war is real, and constantly ongoing, and elites have won that war.\nPower and fear is all that capitalists ever respond to.\nAlways remember that.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

Seems forcing people to do what they don’t want to do, in what is usually a socially oppressive environment, is bad for them.\nThere are, of course, those who thrive in school, and love it, usually the socially dominant kids.

Anyway, tariffs are back to 10% on either side and negotiations will continue.\nNote that China got what they wanted, minus 10%—no negotiations until the tariffs are removed.\nThere will still be a two month trade burp. Ships weren’t leaving China for the US at all, literally zero. Lot of freight companies are about to make a mint, though. So expect some shortages, but nothing worse than Covid, and hopefully lasting less time.\nThe fundamental problem remains, however, which is that there’s no certainty around any of this, so business people can’t make long term plans, including plans to build or relocate manufacturing. Trump and the US can’t be trusted to stay steady on policy, so avoiding making big plans involving the US makes sense.\nThe Great Power picture is clearer, however. The US tried to impose its will on China and failed. China wouldn’t negotiate till its pre-conditions were met. The world has two great powers, with the EU bidding to become the third (I think they’ll fail, but that’s what the rearmament is about.)\nAnd, in economic terms, China is by far the pre-eminent great power. It isn’t even close. The era of American hegemony is officially over. The US tried to impose its will on the world and failed.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.
