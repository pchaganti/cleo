Of course, it’s futile to wring one’s hands and lament Trumpian aspirations to authoritarianism without taking concrete action to prevent them.

Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.",

After peaking in mid-2022, inflation then went into decline—a fall that was just as universal as the initial rise. In this post, we explore the interrelation of inflation dynamics across OECD countries by constructing a measure of the persistence of global inflation. We then study the extent to which the persistence of global inflation reflects broad-based swings, as opposed to idiosyncratic country-level movements. Our main finding is that the spike and subsequent moderation in global inflation in the post-pandemic period were driven by persistent movements. When we look at measures of inflation that include food and energy prices, most of the persistence appears to be broad-based, suggesting that international oil and commodity prices played an important role in global inflation dynamics. Excluding food and energy prices in the analysis still shows a broad-based persistence, although with a substantial increase in the role of country-specific factors.",

Given ongoing uncertainty in Ukraine and the Middle East, this seems an opportune moment to revisit the conventional wisdom about the relationship between inflation and wages: if an unexpected increase in energy costs drives up the cost of living, will workers demand higher wages, reversing the recent moderation in wage growth?

If you wrote something on the internet in the last 20 years, they've stolen it. They've stolen it, they're put it into their little magic box and now they want to sell it back to you.

(Two days! This means they already had everything they needed to ship  the product with Scarlett’s  cloned voice.)\n- Not receiving a response, OpenAI demos the product anyway, with Sam tweeting “her” in reference to Scarlett’s film.\n- When Scarlett’s counsel asked for an explanation of how the “Sky” voice was created, OpenAI yanked the voice from their product line.\nPerhaps Sam’s next tweet should read “red-handed”.",

THe fact that this 960-line file and a somewhat modern C compiler is all you really need to run a state-of-the-art language model is really surprising to many.\nOf course, this is not all there is to a modern LLM, it would probably take another thousand lines or two to implement training, and many more than that to make it fast on all the major CPU and GPU architectures. If you want a flexible framework that lets a developer define any model you want and still goes as fast as it can, the complexity spirals.\nMost programmers have an intuition that duplicating a large software project from scratch, like Linux or Chromium for example, would require incredible amounts of expertise, manpower and time. It's not something that a small team can achieve in a few months. You're limited by talent, not hardware.\nLLMs are very different. THe code isn't that complicated, you could probably implement training and inference for a single model architecture, from scratch, on a single kind of GPU, with reasonable performance, as an individual with a background in programming and who still remembers their calculus and linear algebra, with a year or so of self study. What makes LLMs difficult is getting access to all the hardware to train them, getting the data, and being able to preprocess that data.",

Vulkan didn't even exist back then (and DirectX 12 had only just released) but instead of making things better, it digs it's feet even deeper into the assumption that all shaders will be known ahead of time (resulting in long \"shader recompilation\" dialogs on startup on many games).\nI've been tempted to build my own fast shader compiler into Dolphin for many common GPU architectures. Hell, it wouldn't even be a proper compiler, more of a templated emitter as all shaders fit a pattern. Register allocation and scheduling could all be pre-calculated.\nBut that would be even more insane than ubershaders, as it would be one backend per gpu arch. And some drivers (like Nvidia) don't provide a way to inject pre-compiled shader binaries.\nOn the positive side, ubershaders do solve the problem, and modern GPU drivers do a much better job at accepting ubershaders than they did 9 years ago. Though that's primarily because (as far as I'm aware) examples of Dolphin's ubershader have made their way into every single shader compiler test suite.",

At the time deviantArt made money a few ways.\nIn no particular order, because I don't know which were profitable or which represented a larger portion of revenue:\n- Subscriptions (users could pay for a few extra features and to disable ads on the site)\n- DeviantArt branded merch.\n- Prints and products with users' art printed on them\n- Sponsored Contests. These promoted movies or other media properties, or software of interest to artists. Often the prizes included Wacom tablets and Adobe Photoshop licenses.\nDuring my time there a significant problem we were dealing with was due to deviantArt's stance on adult content. Anything was allowed as long as it wasn't outright pornography.  In practice that meant that nudes were allowed but sexual acts were not. This had consequences for deviantArt's revenue. It meant that we could not run ads from the \"reputable\" ad networks and were forced to deal with seedier outfits that often (e.g. constantly) included malware in the display ads, exposing users to all sorts of nasty stuff. One of my projects was to detect and/or prevent the malware ads which proved challenging and at least given the amount of resources devoted to it, it was not very fruitful.\nIt really is sad for me to see what deviantArt has devolved into. Once the original founders sold out a few years ago I really didn't hold out much hope for the site's future.",

          "description": "> And that typed text is way, way cleaner than any typewriter I’ve seen.\nPedantic point: electric typewriters (which have existed since the 1960s) do type in a way that looks exactly like this.\n(In fact, note that the text on the real employee ID card, shown later in the article, doesn't look any less clean! It's just set in a different, narrower font.)\nThe smudginess of mechanical typewriters comes from 1. them striking (and especially, releasing) at the same speed you're depressing the key, and 2. having many of the keys necessarily approach the ribbon from an angle.\nThe keys being swung weakly by your fingers, also has the additional implication that the ink ribbons used in mechanical typewriters have to be soft and squishy (so: made of cloth), and use thin inks. These properties ensure a transfer from even a low-velocity impact. But the trade-off is that cloth ink ribbons transfer only a rough outline of what's struck; and thin inks are high-bleed inks.\nAn electric typewriter, playing out a pre-buffered line with a crisp, predictable report, using linear actuators and a rotating-ball type-head to bang a tape ribbon loaded with high-viscosity ink onto the page, can create text indistinguishable from books/newspapers of the same period, or from modern laser-printer reproductions of the same font faces. They're essentially character-at-a-time letterpresses!\n(Also, ignoring electric typewriters for a sec: inks bleed more on thin, cheap paper. But this is [a forgery of] an employee ID card — where, for durability, a nice heavyweight paper or cardstock would have been used. You're always going to get a better-looking result inking such paper.)",

It's vile and I don't want my pink fluffy lungs affected by that shit.\nBut do you know what I hate more than smoking?\nMouth dildos.\nWhat the fuck is a mouth dildo?\n-- Everyone\nThis is a mouth dildo:\n\nNot only do you look ridiculous putting that stupid fucking contraption in your mouth, but the plumes of flavoured vapour that bellow from these things make you look even more like an utter cunt.\nI don't want to be subjected to the cherry ice cream vapour pouring from your mouth dildos, seemingly by the bucket load. At least smokers are committing, knowing they're gonna kill themselves, have decided to enjoy it while they're here.\nBut you mouth dildo fuckers are the worst. We don't want to smell your stupid fucking vape. So put it away because you look (and smell) like a dick head.\nPeace ✌🏻\nReply by email",

I would write and publish a post anywhere from 1 - 3 times a week.\nI didn't monetize my blog and I had no dreams of my personal site becoming a business. It was simply a place for me to share things that were on my mind and lessons learned from books I was reading.\nFast forward many years and what we have is the current state of the internet.\nEverything is an ad. Everyone is an influencer. And the algorithms determine what we see and dictate what we post. And for some reason they insist on the entire population becoming video producers.\nIt's an endless game that I lost my taste for long ago.\nThat's why I'm attempting to blog again. I need somewhere to get my thoughts and opinions out without distraction and without too much tech.\nIf the internet stresses you out as much as it does me, might I suggest starting your own blog?\nOr heck, maybe just quit the social internet altogether.",

          "description": "Okay... exhales\nHere we go.\nHi, I'm Meï ! And welcome to this blog. Or this attempt at a blog.\nIt's been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil' kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.\nA friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.\nI used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.\nAs of late, I've been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I've been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn't really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.\nThis built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.\nSo once again, here we go!\n1. As a note, the \"Fucktopia\" is a reference to Souillon's comic book \"Hello Fucktopia\". Couldn't find a listing in English, sorry! It's available in French & Spanish, at least..\nMy small rules of writing\nTry to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.\nFocus! I'm super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.\nNo stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let's keep this place as my comfy Internet place.\nLet's hope it goes well. And I hope you'll enjoy this blog and its topics.\nFan-art of Cyberpunk Bartender Action: VA-11 HALL-A, by rnna_7",

Something you would pay good money to see. A smart generalist is kinda like that.\nA smart generalist is a person who is 80/20 across multiple fields. This means they have reached 80 Percent understanding/capability across multiple fields leveraging around 20 percent of the effort that would typically be needed to fully master it. It makes them unique.\nThe primary skill of a smart generalist is the ability to get from 0 to 80 in a new field quickly. They can quickly identify high ROI leverage points of a subject. It is a learned skill. They also have strong convictions that anything can be learned and learned fast. Even things considered 'tough' by society.\nOn the other hand, we have the cracked specialists. People really good at one thing. Getting to the frontiers and advancing human knowledge. Creating absolutely beautiful works in that 'one thing'.\nIt is a sliding scale. We all lie somewhere between a specialist and a generalist. But we could all do some good to realise we are not limited. We can do multiple things if we want to. It is easy to be hemmed in. To define your identity as 'Software Engineer' or 'Writer' or 'XYZ'. That is what school teaches -'Specialisation'. But humans are versatile. We are the OG general intelligence.

          "description": "(This open letter is inspired by a post I read yesterday by Gabby of woolgathering fame.)\nDear Gabby,\nIt’s not just you: getting over the fear of expectations is hard. I still struggle with it, after 300 something posts. I have a feeling I’ll never get completely over it, but here’s what’s helped me so far.\nPosting a lot helps. I’ve posted so much nonsense on this blog that these days there’s not much I can do that will be worse than something I’ve written before. Somehow, I still have regular readers. Realizing that there are people out there still interested in what I have to say after all the good and not so good is a great comfort. From what you write, you seem to have discovered as much.\nAnother perk of having a large body of work is that each new piece you create becomes a smaller and smaller part of your entire oeuvre. When you’re first starting out, it feels like each creation you put out defines you. After all, if you only have one post, it’s the only thing people can judge you on. If you have a hundred, a wayward post is a drop in the bucket.\nThat said, wouldn’t you still want to see the creations your friends or favorite creators aren’t proud of? Or see their art even if it doesn’t quite fit the niche they’ve carved out for themselves? Everybody half-asses things in their own unique way. There’s a beauty in doing things imperfectly, too.\nAll that is to say, keep up what you’re doing. Creative inertia is a very real thing. You’re doing the right thing by posting, even if you feel like you’re just posting to break the streak of inactivity. Writing in any form begets more writing.\nAnyway, welcome back to Bear! It’s good to have you back.\nYours,\nmisu",

The world is ready to believe almost anything of a man except that he is a genuinely good man. If his life is stainless but unconventional, the world suspects some hidden shame or base motive. So far are most people from understanding or desiring what is true and right that the highest truth is often believed to be the lowest lie, and the purest right is looked upon as the blackest wrong. \n Thus Jesus,…",

Pentecost. \n Born September 30, 1848 at New Harmony, Indiana, Pentecost was given his middle name for Robert Owen, whose followers had established the town as a Fourierist colony a generation earlier. His parents, Emma Flower and Hugh Lockett Pentecost, were of English descent, with many Protestant clergy in their family tree. Hugh moved at age two to Albion, Illinois, which was founded by his grandfather, Scarborough Pentecost, Jr. \n Hugh went as a boy to Kentucky during the Civil War, where he …",
