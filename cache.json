Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York.

Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink's anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom.

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

          "description": "I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.\nIntel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.\nWhat this likely means is two-fold:\n1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.\n2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.\nIf 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.",

There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with \"driver impairment\" tech which was called a \"kill switch\". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just \"sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements\" and \"block the driver from operating the vehicle\". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497\nAnyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration.

          "description": "Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.\nBanks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying \"FBO\" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.\nFWIW, after seeing \"how the sausage is made\", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.\nSee https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/11/08/what-th...",

There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed.

          "description": "Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava\nI've been thinking about this for a while but couldn't gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.\nHow do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn't work long-term. You don't smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you're never free from the thought \"I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now.\" That's why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn't help me), or some other activity where you don't think about the old habit because you literally have no time.\nWhy was I on Twitter? I was bored - it's simply a fact I didn't want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that's it. I don't see anything wrong with games if they don't interfere with main tasks and don't cause negative emotions.\nBesides games, I found a new activity - reading other people's blogs. Until recently, I didn't even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people's posts (thanks to Ava\nfor the tip). I'm very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it's much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.",

It should be no surprise if you’re reading this that I like messages that are confessional in nature; besides, no sincere apology ever made the world a worse place. I'm trying to be better about this myself, owning up to my mistakes and apologizing even when it's hard to do so.\nDecember has always felt like the shortest month of the year to me. So much happens between the holidays and everything else that comes at the end of the year; before you know it, you're spending the next six months erasing and rewriting the last digit every time you write last year instead of the current one.

My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.\nHowever, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.\nSometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.",

I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam's post about social media, and it clicked for me.\nI deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.\nWhat I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I've grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I've had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.\nNow that I'm unshackled again, I'm making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I'm tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I'm doing the same for other people.",

Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.\nAfter moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple \"hello\" while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.\nAnd wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.\nFor now, I’m enjoying my role as a \"hello-er\" and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a \"hello-er\" could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.",

I need less friction between me and my devices or specific websites now - both because of the websites being boring/annoying to me now, and an internal shift where I am just not as interested into online stuff nowadays. Maybe I am aging out of it, maybe I am not the target group anymore. And of course friction helps when you want to spend less time on some feed, but it sucks when you just want to edit the grocery list or respond to an e…",

It felt like the most difficult platform to give up in my quest to redefine my relationship to the internet and reduce the time I spent doomscrolling. There was no other social media that had a hold on me quite like Instagram - especially once their infinite scrolling Reels feature became a key part of the app. I made my first account on the app at age 11, meaning I have spent more than half of the days in my life so far logging into the platform.\nEvery other image on Pinterest being a terrible advertisement\nSeeing trolls post hate comments on every image of a woman ever\nYoutube ads.

I really need to be reflective and focus on processing my thoughts through writing. I’m back baby.\nEvery time I experience a break up, I watch “How To Be Single” (2016). It came out when I was near the end of the high school and really didn’t have much dating experience. It’s almost a decade, and I’ve had a lot of romantic misadventures under my belt at this point. I’ve experience everything that movie showed. Also, I just like how charming Dakota Johnson is in this. Every time I watch the film, I relate to all of the characters more and more with every romantic connection I’ve had.\nSo right now, I feel quite sad.
