          "description": "Whoops, they did it again. Only this time it was no “tragic mistake.” There were no apologies. Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Whoops, They Did It Again appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "I recently left a long career in FANG to roll the dice on an early startup.  I was pretty surprised by the uneven terms between founders and early employees.  From what I could tell the early employees takes more risk than the founders because they don't get that magic token dollar turning into their share of the founding equity event and have to pay the fictional valuation of the seed to convert their options. Depending on how hot your startup is that can be a lot of money.\nAnyway that ended in tears, but I got what I was looking for from it. A look under the covers of the hot VC backed startup roller coaster.  I may be getting old and cynical, but it looked considerably more exploitative than what I saw at Google.  Obviously depends on the character of the founders and leaders, but the structure seems to be setup for toxicity.",

          "description": "The best startups have a concept which is summed up thusly:\n“We all go to the pay window at the same time.”\nIt’s ok for founders to take a little bit of money off of the table if they extend that to their employees as well. Asymmetry is where things get weird.\nI’ve seen many founders who got deep into the fundraising cycles without ever realizing they could take a cent out. VCs will constantly tell you to let it all ride, and sometimes that works out, but for most people, having a little bit of financial security while you’re trying to change the world is necessary.\nThe best startups figure out how to manage liquidity through financing in a way that aligns incentives, keeps the goalposts at the mission, while allowing their teams to thrive.\nIt’s about alignment. If everyone is pulling in the same direction you’re going to execute the vision. Whether you win in the startup lottery is up to the threads of fate, but alignment is the straightest path towards a result.",

If you don’t know exactly what you’re after, and use the LLM as a sparring partner to bounce your ideas off, you’re in for a lot of pain.\nDepending on the way you phrase questions, ChatGPT will gleefully suggest you a wrong approach, just because it’s so intent on satisfying your whim instead of saying No when it would be appropriate.\nAnd in addition to that, you don’t learn by figuring out a new concept. If you already have a feeling of the code you would write anyway, and only treat the model as a smart autocomplete, that doesn’t matter. But for an apprentice, or a layperson, that will keep code as scary and unpredictable as before. I don’t think that should be the answer.",

While I appreciate that it's a difficult line to walk, to have productive and relevant political discussion in a forum like this, politics and social acceptance are a part of every aspect of our lives. Brilliant, kind, impactful people are kept from leading the life they want to lead every day because of societal intolerance for who they are. Incredible people like Lynn who have overcome that intolerance to lead a remarkable life should remind everyone of the suffering that others go through. There are uncountable other people who are not allowed to be themselves and who are suffocated in our society, with the lives of transgender people often ending in ostracisation or murder. One of the remarkable things about technology is that it enables trodden people to escape this tyranny to an extent once impossible. It enables marginalized people to be themselves in our world.  Let us continue to enable that.\nSuch \"political\" discussions and the impact technology has on them are an important part of the discourse here. I'm sad she is gone but I'm glad to see that this post is high up the front page. If you're inclined to denigrate transgender people, I encourage you to consider that they are trying to lead an honest life. I encourage you to consider what you're taking away from them and from the world by dehumanizing them. No matter why they are who they are.",

Developers need to step back, think more deeply, and not worry about being pressured into \"shipping code\" that barely works.\nThe dopamine rush of your code being shipped\nThis frequent overstimulation leads to less ability for long-term attention. When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.\nYour team (and manager) sees you're working\nTough problems need time to solve, and you won't see much meanwhile. If needing to put on a show for others is more important than actually working, something is very wrong.\nYour git commit streak looks good\nYes, people say this doesn't matter. But I'm sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn't a great look.\nOptimising for metrics never works for those who can see through the illusion, and that's an increasing number of people over time. If I was a recruiter and saw that sort of activity, I wouldn't think of it as more than someone just putting on a show --- especially if the majority of those commits are effectively \"thrashing\" or \"churning\".\nThe satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done\nI can personally say that the satisfaction is far bigger the longer you've persevered.",

Will I be able to use it on Android? If I no longer have an iPhone will it be a pain to maintain and use?\nA dog cannot serve two masters. A company like Apple doesn't see any of these things as a product. They're a means to an end: to push the iPhone platform (and hardware sales). That priority will always trump the interests of a product like this.\nIt's also why I refuse to buy more into Google products: it's too much of a risk to lose access to everything if Google wakes up one day and decides to suspend your account with no recourse other than making enough of a stink on social media such that an employee will actually look into it.\nPeople don't want everything tied to one identity, one service, one login.",

And it proves that the real power of consumer AI will be in the hands of the platform owners where you have most of your digital life in already (Apple or Google for messaging, mail, photos, apps; Microsoft for work and/or life).\nThe way Siri can now perform actions based on context from emails and messages like setting calendar and reservations or asking about someone’s flight is so useful (can’t tell you how many times my brother didn’t bother to check the flight code I sent him via message when he asks me when I’m landing for pickup!).\nI always saw this level of personal intelligence to come about at some point, but I didn’t expect Apple to hit it out of the park so strongly. Benefit of drawing people into their ecosystem.\nNevermind all the thought put into private cloud, integration with ChatGPT, the image generation playground, and Genmoji.  I can genuinely see all this being useful for “the rest of us,” to quote Craig. As someone who’s taken a pessimistic view of Apple software innovation the last several years, I’m amazed.\nOne caveat: the image generation of real people was super uncanny and made me uncomfortable. I would not be happy to receive one of those cold and impersonal, low-effort images as a birthday wish.",

          "description": "I parent a child with autism. The care needs are intense; the burnout is real. But I can't employ usual burnout mitigation techniques like taking time off or making career / lifestyle changes. The world relentlessly marches forward. However, I've learned human resilience is AMAZING. You'll be surprised at what you are capable of when life asks for it.\nHere are a few big insights that have really helped me:\n- You never have to feel like doing something to start doing it. This insight is so strangely freeing. It really got me out of my head and the loop that I was in berating myself about motivation.\n- The act of doing something is usually what creates motivation to continue. Tell yourself you'll spend 30 minutes on whatever it is. No matter what it is, I always know I can survive 30 minutes of it. However, 90% of the time, the timer goes off, but I don't feel like stopping. I've found my grove and I keep going.\n- Procrastination isn't poor time management; it's poor emotional management. Be gentle with yourself. Know that you can be scared, frustrated, or angry but don't have to let those emotions define you. CBT works really well here. Don't define emotions as \"good\" or \"bad\". Define them as \"useful\". If the emotion you feel isn't useful, acknowledge it, but realize it's fleeting and let it pass on. Some people like to visualize emotions as clouds drifting by.\n\"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.\"\n(My grandmother, who survived the Great Depression on a farm, had the Desiderata posted on her wall. https://www.desiderata.com/desiderata.html)",

I've known a lot of weird nerds, am one myself, and there's lots of different flavors, most of them not autistic.\nSo much of talent is just really caring about something specific. Caring about it above other things. Specifically above external motivation and incentives. Do that and the weirdness grows naturally, neurodivergence isn't even necessary (though it might help)",

What of? People who feel the need to constantly be busy or doing this, and that, and, well, the other. Is it something that happened slowly, over night, I wonder? Is it since the advent of smart phones, or maybe TV even? Or was it always there and I just didn't notice it?\nBecause, I'm of a mind that I really don't feel the need to be constantly doing something, anything, or going somewhere to do something (like sports), whether to participate or watch. I'm not always in front of a screen, or TV. I have a life outside of smart gadgets that involves me walking around a garden, or sitting in a park staring at, well,…",

It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.\nA large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?\nIn Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that \"looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.\" I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I'm not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I'm nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I'm doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.",

          "description": "Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?\nWeekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.\nBy the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.\nIt's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.\nWhere is that petition for the 4-day work week?\nThis weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

          "description": "I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:\nI feel like my life started after I turned 50. It's so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.\nHe says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels \"less serious\".\nI turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.\nI don't worry so much about what people think of me. It's not that I don't care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I've come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.\nYou can't please them all – and that's fine!\nIn many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…\nBut that doesn’t feel very important.\nThe lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It's more fun and interesting to live.\nNo matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.\nWant more “proof”?

This is certainly not USA Today, et ce n’est certainement pas Aujourd’hui en France. Indeed, it is a refreshing antidote to all such discourses of modern state capitalism. During its short but colourful existence, post-anarchism has always been libertarian and socialist in its basic philosophical outlook: that’s the anarchism part. But post-@ has also maintained its independence from modern rationalism and modern concepts of subjectivity: that’s the post- part.

But we find it necessary that some things …",
