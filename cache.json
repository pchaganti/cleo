          "description": "The vast majority of Americans believe that the United States economy is unfairly rigged to benefit the rich. In the past few weeks, the Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris, has proven that this is an accurate assessment. She initially backed her own administration’s initiative to increase top earners’ total tax rate including on capital gains to nearly 45 percent. This was included in President Joe Biden’s 2025 budget proposal. But soon after billionaire donors made it clear they preferred not to part with any fraction of their wealth, she pivoted, announcing in September that she backed a significantly lower capital gains tax rate of 33 percent.

In the foreign policy realm, she or he will face vexing decisions over Ukraine, Israel/Gaza, and China/Taiwan.

She went to see if her house was still standing. She found it partially destroyed, yet still she tried to clear the rubble to live in it once more.

          "description": "The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More\nThe post Murder in Beita: the IDF’s Killing of Ayşenur Eygi appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More\nThe post Nice Health Ya Got There, Mister.

It's cosplay.\nReal wartime footing:\n1. Direction and technical decisions are driven by priorities of board-level members and often arrive in email form late on Friday evening.  The entire organisation is expected to pivot immediately. A new senior leadership team member starts scheduling daily read-outs on project progress, and half the organisation spends the weekend frantically hallucinating project plans into Google Sheets.\n2. Engineering staff react with dull-eyed disbelief on Monday; they knew this was coming, because the same thing happened a month ago, and six weeks before that.\n3. Emails come from HR that there are are new, even-more-labyrinthine approval processes for expenses, and shrinking budgets for anything not directly related to whatever the projet du jour, which will be fed enough to make it look like it's succeeding until the next Friday evening email kills it.\n4. There is wide-spread burn-out across Engineering teams, and people are reduced to reactive, sarcastic automatons.\n5. A creeping understanding seizes the better engineers that things cannot improve; they sign articles of  Armistice, pretend to comply, and start interviewing elsewhere.\n6. An email arrives on Friday night...\n> Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company's still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what's still good can help with morale.\nIf HN supported gifs, there'd be several in this spot.",

The actual critiques are personalized to the content and, to one extent or another, valid, but the social purpose of the critiques is universal which is that I felt uncomfortable that reading this might mean I have to re-evaluate my worldview and I'm going to dive into the comment section and upvote all the people telling me actually, I don't have to do that.\nI actually spent over an hour writing 750+ words of my takeaways reading this document and shared it privately with a few founder friends of mine and I briefly considered also posting to share with the community but I took a look at the comments and took a look at what I wrote and decided I didn't have the energy to face the endless onslaught of nitpicks and misunderstandings that are driven, at the end of the day, not by a genuine intellectual desire to reach an understanding, but by the need to prove emotionally that others are not taking this seriously so I don't have to either.\nAll I can do is be vague and say I think this was an enormously valuable piece of writing that is worth engaging seriously for what it is as it might change your worldview in several important ways.\nBut also my larger meta-point is that there's a now near ubiquitous \"sour grapes\" attitude that's pervaded HN that makes it an extremely unpleasant place to hold a conversation and people reading should be aware of this systematic bias when reading comments here.",

          "description": "Lot of people critiquing this, but you can't deny the success. I think a lot of the advice is applicable to startups.\n1. KPIs, for Beast they are CTR, AVD, AVP, will look different if you are a startup. I am willing to bet he knows his metrics better than >95% of startup founders. Because he is literally hacking/being judged by an algorithm, his KPIs will matter more and can be closely dissected. Startups aren't that easy in that sense, but KPIs still matter.\n2. Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.\n3. Building value > making money\n4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders/equity owners, not employees.\n5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.\nThe management/communication stuff is mostly about working on set/dealing with physical scale. You need a lot more hands dealing with logistics, which requires hardline communication and management. In startups, the team is usually really lean and technical, so management becomes more straightforward.\nI am also getting some bad culture vibes from the PDF and really dislike the writing style. I think it's important not to micromanage to the extent he is--it's necessary, maybe, for his business. Not for startups. Interesting perspective, reminds me of a chef de cuisine in a cutthroat 90s kitchen. The dishes (videos) have to be perfect, they require a lot of prep and a lot of hands, and you have to consistently pump them out.",

Puzzle 66 contained 66 unknown bits and had 6.6 BTC deposited into it by the initial puzzle creator. The private key was 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002832ed74f2b5e35ee or 256 bits with mostly zeroes but 66 random ones.\nThe next Bitcoin puzzle, #67, has 67 unknown bits, and contains 6.7 BTC up for grabs: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BY8GQbnue...\nThe previous puzzle by order of difficulty was #64 (not #65, because see below) and was solved on 9/9/2022, so about 2 years ago. In other words, it took about 2 years of compute time to run the 2^66 bruteforcing task.\nPuzzles that are multiple of 5 (#65 or #70) are special: they have twice more entropy. So that private key #65 doesn't have 65-bit of entropy but 130-bit of entropy. And the creator of the puzzle intentionally published their public key on the blockchain. When you know the public key, brutetforcing the n-bit private key only requires 2^(n/2) work. So puzzle #65 with a 130-bit key actually require bruteforcing up to only 2^65 keys.",

          "description": "Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.\nI work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it's able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many \"problem shapes\". For instance, I can give it a logic problem like \"i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially\" and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.\nYes, you probably wouldn't be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.\nside: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.\nMany of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.",

McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.\n> McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.\n> McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/boeing-planes-proble...",

The magic is that _it knows english_. It knows english at or above a level equal to most fluent speakers, and it also can produce output that is not just a likely output, but is a logical output.

It's an engine that outputs.\nAsking it about nuanced details in the corpus of data it has read won't give you good output unless it read a bunch of it.\nOn the other hand, if you were to paste the entire documentation set to a tool it has never seen and ask it to use the tool in a way to accomplish your goals, THEN this model would be likely to produce useful output, despite the fact that it had never encountered the tool or its documentation before.\nDon't treat it as a database.

In April I used the standard GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to help me reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol used by my kitchen fan to integrate it into Home Assistant.\nIt was helpful in a rubber duck way, but could not determine the pattern used to transmit the remaining runtime of the fan in a certain mode. Initial prompt here [0]\nI pasted the same prompt into o1-preview and o1-mini and both correctly understood and decoded the pattern using a slightly different method than I devised in April. Asking the models to determine if my code is equivalent to what they reverse engineered resulted in a nuanced and thorough examination, and eventual conclusion that it is equivalent. [1]\nTesting the same prompt with gpt4o leads to the same result as April's GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) model.\nAmazing progress.\n[0]: https://pastebin.com/XZixQEM6\n[1]: https://i.postimg.cc/VN1d2vRb/SCR-20240912-sdko.png (sorry about the screenshot – sharing ChatGPT chats is not easy)",

Basically, HR at many companies gives your salary and employment history data to Equifax, who then sells access to the information to certain parties with supposed need to access it, including potential and current employers and creditors.  This report is likely one of the most invasive consumer files out there for many people.\nI cannot comment on the legality of this kind of data sharing, but as I and others have pointed out, it has existed for a while.  I do agree that it is concerning.  You can freeze your Equifax The Work Number report at least, just like other credit reports.\n[1] https://theworknumber.com/",

          "description": "When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.\nAfter I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.\nAnyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.\nMy photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I'm choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.\nAnyways.\nFor those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:\nJEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.\nNotes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.\nSnaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.\n59/100\nReply by email",

Luckily, there's a solution to the problem:\nStart blogging!\nThere's no better way. Or rather, it's the only way.\nWe might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it's only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.\nWe find ourselves by connecting with others.\nMy first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.\nThis blog is my first \"serious\" one in English. It's still relatively new and doesn't have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I'll start a separate blog about writing online. I don't know; time will tell...\nWhat I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.\nAre you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice? Get them out there! That's where they do good – both for others and for yourself.",

          "description": "Gingerbread computer  \n\nWhen I inspect houses as part of my work, I always advise homeowners to check their attics a couple of times a year. I also suggest making it as easy as possible to do so, for example by installing a built-in ladder. If it feels too cumbersome to check your attic, it's easy to put it off.\nFor the same reason, I want as little resistance as possible when it comes to blogging. I keep my blog post ideas easily accessible, no matter where I am. When it's time to write, I do it in the default text editor if I'm at my computer, or in my phone's standard notes app.\nAfter translating (I always write in Swedish) and editing the text, I open the browser shortcut to create a new blog post. I preview it and maybe do some formatting. Then I publish the post.\nThe Blogging Workflow\nWhen I read certain blogging workflows, I'm surprised at how complicated they seem. At the same time, I think that for those particular bloggers, the technical aspect is one of the reasons they enjoy blogging. It's not a barrier; it's an example of the importance of interests.\nMy approach of writing in Swedish and then translating into English can certainly be perceived as complicated. But I find it fun and interesting. It took quite a while before I found a way to write in English in a way that I felt good about.\nRegardless of your approach to blogging, make sure it feels easy and fun. \"Easy\" is of course very individual in this case. That's where the \"fun\" part comes in - easy can be technically complicated in a fun way.\n3 Tips for Easy Blogging\nIt should work on any device.\nIt should work no matter where you are.\nIt should be easy to go from writing to publishing.\nWe live in a time of almost unlimited possibilities. Take this opportunity to play around. Find a setup that suits you, and don't be afraid to try new methods.\nKeep on blogging!",

There's even a dedicated \"What to blog about?\" category on the Blog Inspiration page.\nWhile I understand that many feel this way, the \"problem\" for me is rather the opposite: I have so many ideas that I don't know which one to choose. And on those rare occasions when I'm completely out of ideas, I write even if I have nothing to write about.\nMy biggest source of inspiration is everyday life. Even the most trivial moments carry something interesting. It could be something someone says or does, a certain environment, or something I'm engaged in:\nA podcast.\nA book.\nA song.\nA documentary.\nA movie.\nIt's swarming with blog posts waiting to be written, if we're just paying attention. When such a potential post crosses my path, I usually make a note, a voice memo, or take a photo, depending on what's easiest in the context. Currently, there are two photos and three notes waiting to become blog posts.\nOf course, this setup doesn't suit all types of blogs. But I dare say that it's an approach that works for the majority of bloggers.\nHow has your day been? What have you experienced? What people have you met? What have you seen, read, and heard?

Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.\nOver time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.\nNone of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other.

I also like that it has no trackers or JavaScript.\nI've had some weird feelings about maintaining my own Substack for a while now. I just don't think I'm personally cut out for the platform: I don't have a single subject I can write about consistently (and, to be honest, I don't think I can really write consistently at all); I don't like that it's massively metrics-based as I really don't care about that sort of thing; I don't like the constant push to monetize when I've never had any intention of doing that; and, honestly, I was kind of running out of things to say. The fiction I posted just felt like filler so that people would remember the blog existed at all.

On Bear, I have regularly shared light, easily digestible reads, like slices of life and productivity takes. But I have also shared the brutal reality of living with mental health struggles.\nI created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist's advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.\nI won't lie to you, though, t…",

          "description": "I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.\nThere came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.\nI continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.\nWhile I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.\nI’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.\nReply via email",

Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized.
