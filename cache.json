          "description": "Recent events have heightened awareness of systemic risk stemming from nonbank financial sectors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.",

          "description": "Expectations can play a significant role in driving economic outcomes, with central banks factoring market sentiment into policy decisions and market participants forming their own assumptions about monetary policy. But how well do central banks understand the expectations of market participants—and vice versa? Our model, developed in a recent paper, features a dynamic game between (i) a monetary authority that cannot commit to an inflation target and (ii) a set of market participants that understand the incentives created by that credibility problem. In this post, we describe the game, a type of Keynesian beauty contest: its main novelty is that each side attempts, with varying degrees of accuracy, to forecast the other’s beliefs, resulting in new findings regarding the levels and trajectories of inflation.",

          "description": "Sorry time: years ago I worked on a telemedicine web app before telemedicine was nearly as popular as it is today. Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.\nWell one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.\nWell, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.\nSince then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers.",

          "description": "I do MRI work, and my gut is that none of the claims about dance vs. exercise would replicate. The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors' behavioral data doesn't show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...\nThe brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I'm referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don't reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors' claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p = .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p > .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.\nIn general, my priors on \"we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period\" are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.",

          "description": "Connectome-adjacent neuroscientist here. Definitely not a dead end! But also definitely not the whole picture.\nOne of the main open questions in neuroscience right now is how network structure, dynamics, and function are related in the brain. Connectomes provide tremendous insight into structure, but as mentioned this does not generically solve either the dynamics or function problem. For example, for many of these neurons we don't have a good understanding of their input-output relationship, and the nature of this relationship can strongly affect the dynamics that emerge in a highly connected network. Individual variability across connectomes, and how connectomes change over development are also a significant issue, but at least for the fly it's thought that many of the basic structures are pretty conserved across adult animals, even if many of the details could differ.\nModulo these caveats, knowing the physical network structure of the brain does still impose huge constraints on what kinds of models we should be using for gaining insight into dynamics and function. For example, there are well known areas (the \"mushroom bodies\") with specific feed-forward connectivity patterns that are very different from a random recurrent network. Further, there are at least some areas in the fly brain where we think there are indeed quite clean structure-function relationships, e.g. in the central complex of the fly brain, which contains a physical ring of neurons and is thought to support a \"bump\" of activity that acts as a sort of compass that helps flies navigate via a ring-attractor-like dynamical system. Thus, even though it has many missing pieces, a wiring diagram like this can be tremendously useful for generating hypotheses to guide more targeted experiments and theoretical studies.",

Which would have obviously caught the mistake here.\nFeels like another “Firefox is underinvested in developer relations” story, which is surprising given how much they rely on them.\nEdit: honestly the idea that gorhill doesn’t have a dedicated rep at Mozilla is baffling to me.

You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA.

She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.\nThree Years Later\nWhat seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.\nThree Years Later\nArriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.\nSix Years Later\nHaving waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus.

          "description": "In a world of endless notifications, feature-bloated apps, and constant digital noise, I found myself yearning for simplicity. That's why I created Nihil - a suite of minimalist tools designed to help you focus on what truly matters.\nThe Vision Behind Nihil\nNihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.\nThat's the core of Nihil's philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.\n\nWhat Makes Nihil Different?\nPurposeful Design\nEvery feature in Nihil is there because …",

          "description": "My first time watching Everything, Everywhere, All At Once (EEAAO) was at a friend's house with about ten other Asian immigrants. There's a scene where the male lead, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), was putting googly eyes all over the lanterns and doing a sneaky shush at the camera before running away.\n\"Oh, that's [deadname],\" said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.\nEh? That's me?\nI'll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my \"I have to be a man\" phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It's very easy to read it that way because Waymond's character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead. He is presented as effeminate, weak, and his voice is high-pitched and lacks a full range. As a knee-jerk gut reaction, we foc…",
