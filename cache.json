Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.\nBut what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.\nStarting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.\nLet go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.\nBegin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.\nWhen the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an \"About\" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.\nStep by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.\nSoon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.\nCommunity echoes\nFW: Blog Like a Painter by Yordi\n(I am) the painter with dried up paint cans by Jedda",

          "description": "I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.\nOne guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.\nWriting forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.\nOf course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).\nOne annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.\nOn the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.\nWhile I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)\nP.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?",

Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don't know what to write about. My answer is always the same:\n\"Blog your way to the answer.\"\nWe can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.\nBlog, blog, blog – that's the solution.\nWe might come to realize that we don't need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.\nOr maybe we'll realize that blogging isn't our thing at all. Then at least we've tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn't waste our time ruminating about it.\nThe only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It's still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.\nMany of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I'm really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog's small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.\nWho knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don't have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:\nThrough blogging.

          "description": "Since discovering my favorite types of blog posts are essay-like in anatomy and length, I've dedicated a lot of time to both writing and reading such posts. Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I'll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I'll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I've really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don't always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.\nWhen I post something in the morning, I'll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don't have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it's a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I've also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me. I feel really good after blogging, and I don't ever want that to change.\nʚ ═══･୨ ꕤ ୧･═══ ɞ",

          "description": "I'm sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.\nI've meditated myself in periods. I'm actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.\nFew things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I've tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.\nAm I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the \"technique\" isn't so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.\nIf meditation becomes something that \"should be done\" - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task 'meditation' on the to-do list.\nI leave you with that to meditate on.",

As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way. Most of the time I was glad it was over, because I could finally stop the forced writing.\nI also wrote for a fairly big gaming website for a couple of years, but I always dreaded writing long reviews.

Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.\n \n\nThe second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument.

While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf.
