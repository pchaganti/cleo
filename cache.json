Serious economic and social problems afflicting national working classes have been “managed”—at least temporarily—by scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be “tough on immigrants” showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as “protecting the nation against an immigrant ‘invasion’” widely prevailed.

          "description": "> Performance management, as practiced in many large corporations in 2024, is an outdated technology that is in need of an update\nAuthor made a couple of fundamental mistakes: the first is they assume employees are (or should be) paid according to how much they \"individually\" earned the company. Employers strive to pay employees the minimum they can bear, on employer's terms. Those terms are information asymmetry and a Gaussian distribution. Fairness is the last thing one should expect from employers, but being honest about this is not good for morale, so instead, they rely on keeping employees uninformed, while the employers collude to gather everyone's remuneration history via the Work Number.\nThe second mistake they made is assume that companies would prioritize being lean and trimming the mediocre & bottom 5%. There are other considerations, combined productivity is more important than having individual superstars working on the shiniest features. How much revenue do you think a janitor or café staffer generates? Close to zero. The same goes for engineering. Someone has to do the unglamorous staff, or you end up with a dysfunctional company, with amazing talent (on paper).\nEdit: there's an infamous graph that shows when aggregate worker productivity and average income. The two tracked closely, rising in tandem until the 1970s, where they got decoupled. With income becoming much flatter, and productivity continuing to rise.

          "description": "It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.\nBecause of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.\nDespite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.",

Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.\nRegarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.\nIf you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents. They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.\n[1] https://www.regeringen.dk/media/13261/aftale-om-et-groent-da...\n[2] https://mgtp.dk/media/iinpdy3w/aftale_om_implementering_af_e...",

          "description": "Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.\nI know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.\nSo, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.",

Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.\n- One was in an industry that didn't need \"Webscale\" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.\nAnother outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.\nThe place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.\nI don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.",

If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it's feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don't bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.\nThe reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don't yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.\nThe reason you don't fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.",

So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.\nBut then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later.

          "description": "After a two-month writing hiatus, I'm back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.\nTwo weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I'm gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.\nTransportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I've opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.\nThis isn't my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I'm visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I've been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic \"konnichiwa\"s.\nMy ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.\nMy professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I'll join a new workplace where I've already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I'm aware that I'm really lucky to have found such an environment, and I'm hopeful about building a long-term community here.",

I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine.

Other people were just enjoying today's newspaper.\nI had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious.

Today, it's often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.\nI tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn't feel right—at least not at the moment.\nI don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!\nMaybe it's a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian \"jantelagen\" (Law of Jante). I don't know.\nI don't blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.\nPersonally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it's nice to know that I don't \"have to.\" And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.\nBut hey, if you're ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I'll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️",

How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it'll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).\nThe issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn't an issue for me last time, this time I'm still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don't want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can't help but go to my phone whenever I'm bored, no matter how much I try to help it.\nI've been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I've taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.",
