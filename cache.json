I’ve wanted this to happen since 1970.  When the Senate hearings led by Franck Church revealed the extent of the FBI’s (and the CIA’s) infiltration of political and cultural organizations a couple years later, my hatred of the agency multiplied a hundredfold.  That being said, I don't want the FBI to be replaced by a Donald Trump-run national police agency—a TBI, if you will. For those who don’t know and those who don’t remember, Richard Nixon tried to remake the FBI in his image back in the early 1970s.  He got very close to doing so.  According to what I’ve been able to parse over the years in my reading, conversation and other research, a big reason Nixon failed in turning the FBI into his own private police force was the presence of another powerful reactionary. That was the long time director of the Agency, J. Edgar Hoover, who only ended his directorship by dying. More\nThe post The Trumpist Bureau of Investigation? appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

Which is pretty funny. What she in fact said was that she knew “only one person who voted for Nixon,” that the rest of them were “outside my ken,” and that she could feel their presence only sometimes “when I’m in a theater.” Which is no longer funny, just irritating. Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York. Yet, as the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in her new book, the well-publicized contempt of the elites for those they consider “hillbillies” or “rednecks” significantly contributes to our current political malaise.

Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh in central India, was then inhabited by nearly 900,000 people. The leakage occurred due to exothermic reactions that set off within a partially buried stainless steel tank containing about 42 tonnes of an extremely volatile and highly toxic chemical called methyl isocyanate (MIC), which was stored in liquid form.

          "description": "During 2018-19, the U.S. levied import tariffs of 10 to 50 percent on more than $300 billion of imports from China, and in response China retaliated with high tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. Estimating the aggregate impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy is challenging because tariffs can affect the economy through many different channels. In addition to changing relative prices, tariffs can impact productivity and economic uncertainty. Moreover, these effects can take years to become apparent in the data, and it is difficult to know what the future implications of a tariff are likely to be. In a recent paper, we argue that financial market data can be very useful in this context because market participants have strong incentives to carefully analyze the implications of a tariff announcement on firm profitability through various channels. We show that researchers can use movements in asset prices on days in which tariffs are announced to obtain estimates of market expectations of the present discounted value of firm cash flows, which then can be used to assess the welfare impact of tariffs. These estimates suggest that the trade war between the U.S. and China between 2018 and 2019 had a negative effect on the U.S. economy that is substantially larger than past estimates.",

          "description": "US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from \"ordinary expenses\" as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people's intuition of what \"living paycheck-to-paycheck\" means. That isn't nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.\nThere is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; \"ordinary\" is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as \"ordinary\". By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.\nBy contrast, the median US household has >$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as \"ordinary\" and therefore not saving it. The categories of \"non-ordinary\" expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.\nThe implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.\nAmericans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.",

By the end, my advice for every manager was roughly:\n* Don't add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed.\n* Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.)\n* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week.\n* Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)\n* Never forget your team is full of actual humans.",

They have cards of cards (platforms), which they produce, validate and sell. They have NVLink crossbars and switches which connects these cards on their card of cards with very high speeds and low latency.\nFor inter-server communication they have libraries which coordinate cards, workloads and computations.\nThey bought Mellanox, but that can be used by anyone, so there's no lock-in for now.\nAs a tangent, NVIDIA has a whole set of standards for pumping tremendous amount of data in and out of these mesh of cards. Let it be GPU-Direct storage or specialized daemons which handle data transfers on and off cards.\nIf you think that you can connect n cards on PCIe bus and just send workloads to them and solve problems magically, you'll hurt yourself a lot, both performance and psychology wise.\nYou have to build a stack which can perform these things with maximum possible performance to be able to compute with NVIDIA. It's not just emulating CUDA, now. Esp., on the high end of the AI spectrum (GenAI, MultiCard, MultiSystem, etc.).\nFor other lower end, multi-tenant scenarios, they have card virtualization, MIG, etc. for card sharing.

Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.\nIntel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.\nWhat this likely means is two-fold:\n1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.\n2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.\nIf 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.",

          "description": "I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn't waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.\nNonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, \"I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....,\" which was code for \"I want the night off.\"\nI believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.",

There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with \"driver impairment\" tech which was called a \"kill switch\". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just \"sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements\" and \"block the driver from operating the vehicle\". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497\nAnyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I'll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.",

          "description": "Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.\nBanks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying \"FBO\" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.\nFWIW, after seeing \"how the sausage is made\", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.\nSee https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/11/08/what-th...",

Sometimes I wonder: if you added up all the time I've spent trying to figure out how exactly to word a post so as to not give any potential future employers any doubts about me, how many hours would that be? Or the time spent deciding which tracks to feature on my Bandcamp to have the best chance of someone hearing my music and thinking I might be a good fit for their projects?

Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn't enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.\nMuch self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making.

          "description": "Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava\nI've been thinking about this for a while but couldn't gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.\nHow do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn't work long-term. You don't smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you're never free from the thought \"I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now.\" That's why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn't help me), or some other activity where you don't think about the old habit because you literally have no time.\nWhy was I on Twitter? I was bored - it's simply a fact I didn't want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that's it. I don't see anything wrong with games if they don't interfere with main tasks and don't cause negative emotions.\nBesides games, I found a new activity - reading other people's blogs. Until recently, I didn't even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people's posts (thanks to Ava\nfor the tip). I'm very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it's much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.",

When I do write, I never have much of anything to say.

My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.\nHowever, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.\nSometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.",

I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam's post about social media, and it clicked for me.\nI deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.\nWhat I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I've grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I've had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.\nNow that I'm unshackled again, I'm making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I'm tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I'm doing the same for other people.",

          "description": "Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.\nAfter moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple \"hello\" while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.\nAnd wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.\nFor now, I’m enjoying my role as a \"hello-er\" and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a \"hello-er\" could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.",

We give up our time for what we do not want; 10-20 years for a house, 5-10 for a car, 50-100 hours per month for food, then phone bills, utilities, holiday gifts, shopping shopping shopping. We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt. Our careers become our lives. \n In exchange for lost time we reproduce ourselves as obedient laborers, our consciousness accepts the global economic system as not only necessary but good, our taxes directly fund the imperialist monstrosities of the day, while our contribution to the GDP indirectly funds them. \n We aim…",

I remember past times when anarchists, who shunned rather than sought organizational posts, were seen as the best guarantee of revolutionary success, thanks to their moral solvency and especially their revolutionary intransigence. But apparently things have changed and now it is that very intransigence that is attacked most harshly. \n “We defend the CNT’s independence,” they tell us, but then carry on about the so-called dictato…",

English translation by Churck Morse.\nSource: Durruti in the Spanish Revolution by Abel Paz.\n\n Captain, I’ve seen my comrades fall in slow death throes and then collapse on the ground, blood pouring out of their mouths, while life flees through small holes in their foreheads. These holes of death crush the skulls of their victims and comprehension in those who reflect upon them.
