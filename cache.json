A kid who's behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who's ahead can be nurtured.\nWe had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things \"they shouldn't be\" was just‚Ä¶ insanely frustrating.\nNow in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.",

When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.",

          "description": "This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the \"aliveness\" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label \"life\" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.\nMitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?\nThe implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.",

There still isn't one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.\nI thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don't have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.\nBy assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it's fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that's okay.\nA small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don't want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.\nHappy blogging!",

I'm currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather's got a mood, and it's contagious.\nI love the sound of rain. I think it's soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it's Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.\nMaybe it's just one of those days. I've done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.\nAnd so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don't quite know what to do with just yet.\nThat's all.\n83/100\nComments\n\nIt's snowing in Eastern Canada! ü§©‚ùÑÔ∏è\n-Denis\nIt‚Äôs a wet day here too.

          "description": "Vector embeddings by themselves are pretty neat. Binary quantized vector embeddings are extra impressive. In short, they can retain 95+% retrieval accuracy with 32x compression and ~25x retrieval speedup. Let's get into how this works and why it's so crazy.\nWhat are embeddings?\nEmbeddings let you turn an arbitrary piece of text into a series of numbers that manage to represent the meaning of the content. These embedding vectors can range in dimension from 512 on the shorter end all the way up to 8192 or more. Typically each of the weights in the vector is represented as a 32-bit floating point number.\nLLMs use embeddings to represent input text, but embeddings can also be used on their own.\nEmbeddings enable you to easily search for pieces of content that have similar meanings by finding t‚Ä¶",

These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly \"save the day\" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.\nThese ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nObviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect \"perfection\" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.",

Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves.

We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about.
