Image courtesy of Facebook.\nIn David Pogue’s book, How to Prepare for Climate Change, he suggests readers consider relocating to what he deems “climate safe-havens,” or fifteen cities that offer protection from the worst of climate disaster. These so-called safe havens spread across the northeastern part of the United States, from Minnesota to New York, and as far south as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the Virginias.  Like the “rust belt,” “bible belt,” or “cornbelt,” these post-industrial cities are being redefined by their legacy infrastructure access to freshwater and moderate weather. \nThe designation of climate safe havens offers a little bit of hope alongside the litany of dire studies highlighting the irreversible effects of climate change. Studies like this one from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)tell us that this past May was the hottest May recorded on Earth, marking it the 12th consecutive month of record-breaking heat. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reports that last year brought 28 weather and climate disaster that cost over a billion dollars in damages—yet another record broken. \nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Inside Big Tech’s Race to “Climate Safe-Havens” appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

With AT&T I can go to their website and unlock an old phone in minutes, allowing them to use a no-cost carrier like QLink Wireless.

          "description": "I am blind, it was degenerative so it sounds different than what your kid has.\nI have a few pieces of advice. This is more about my own upbringing, so don't take any of it as an accusation towards you.\n1) Don't hide things about their condition or prospects.\nI grew up in a very loving home. However, my parents found out I was going blind when I was ~8, I didn't find out until I was 13.  My mother wanted to protect me from 'being the blind kid'. But I was. Not knowing made everything so much harder and more confusing.\n2) Don't rely too much on technology. Stick and dog are the best tools blind people have. Everything else, in my opinion, is a flash in the pan and won't have long term support. Not made by blind people and with minimal consulting for them. Like what a sighted person thinks a blind person needs after closing their eyes and walking around their house for a few minutes. (Screen readers are useful, I'm not talking about those.)\nFor a piece of tech I was excited for and is now dystopian: https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete\n3) Foster independence. The world is not made for us. It's also full of high speed metal deathtraps. The easiest thing to do is stay inside where I know where everything is. Even walking to the grocery store is a deeply uncomfortable endeavor. But I need to do it. I need to be able to live with that discomfort and not let it dissuade me from living the most human life I can.\nThe blind cane is very valuable. It took me too long to accept blindness as an identity, get over the shame, and start using it. I lost a lot of time to that.\nBlindness sucks in every conceivable way. It affects every part of ones life. But I had a good childhood and I have a good life. All things considered, I'm extremely lucky for the circumstances of my birth because of the family I was born into. You can't take away the blindness but you can still give them a wonderful life.",

Terrorism, at least least in my view, is an attack that either intentionally targets civilians or is truly indiscriminate, and is aimed at producing political cha age by causing fear.\nBy those definitions, I think this is clearly not terrorism. (Though we might learn more information about who was targeted that could change this assessment.) Admittedly, my definitions only imperfectly track the way the word is used in the west, but I think that's only due to frequent misuse of the term for political ends.\nI would worry about a definition of terrorism that creates an incentive to avoid this type of warfare in favor of dropping bombs.",

          "description": "That's an impressive supply-chain hack. Spend years showing how insecure modern telecom devices are and scare your enemy into going old-school, receive-only. Set up a shell company to sell pagers to your enemy's shell company. Give them devices implanted with a small explosive charge pointed inward, knowing they will be worn around the waist most of the time.\nHack the backend server, send a coordinated page to all the pagers at the same time. You've just injured and identified most of your enemies, incapacitated them, completely broken their communication network and effectively given you weeks of disarray to do whatever you want to further disrupt them.\nYou have to hand it to them -- it's a clever strategy with minimal casualties outside of your enemy. This is a Stuxnet-level hack that we'll probably never fully understand.",

There's also the risk that other major producers could replicate this tactic, potentially leading to further escalation in the region or beyond.\nIn the short term, it's a smart strategy for Israel, but they've likely opened Pandora's box in the process.",

It explores the legal history of surcharges and underscores that there are precedents (i.e., in 1974, 1981, and 1992) for their complete removal. The paper also shows that surcharges are a burden on indebted countries and that the Fund's official arguments for retaining them do not hold. \nEnglish\n\n/ \nExternal debt, \nIMF",

          "description": "Earlier this week, I decided that I was going to take a mental health day today (Friday). This week was a tough one and I really needed this break.\nBut also because I have once again maxed out my accrued vacation days.\nWe start accruing hours almost immediately. The longer the tenure, the more hours we accrue each day. There is also a cap of how much you can accrue (also based on tenure) until it stops. They advertise it as a way to “encourage employees to take a break and take time off.” As long as you’re below that cap, you can keep accruing and you can roll it over to the next year. We also have sick days outside of that vacation accrual. Due to California laws, residents of CA got an increase number of sick days this year. Those don’t roll over though.\nAll this to say, I have a ton of sick days left that I’m trying to use, but I also have to keep track of my vacation days. This means having to take one-off days so that I don’t waste any of my accruals thus today's Mental Health Day.\nI know that I probably should just take a longer vacation to somewhere, but it’s difficult when I’m always on a deadline.\nAnyways.\nOrganizations that give out unlimited vacations will never work for me. I’d end up wasting it, and when I leave the company, there would be nothing for them to pay me out on. Silver lining and all that.\nFriday Photo 📸\n\nA section of my cork board featuring my enamel pin collection\nLC is finally back from her last trip of the month.

While I am no Nietzsche or Kafka, I live in one, like any person in today's world—a world undoubtedly centered around a prominent theme: patriotism.\nWhat even is patriotism? The word often carries different meanings depending on who you ask. Some define it as love and loyalty to one's country, a commitment to uphold a national belief or the core values they personally hold dear. Others, however, may view it with suspicion—closely associated with nationalism, pride, and even exclusion. At its core, patriotism is often seen as an allegiance to a flag, regardless of a country’s flaws. Living within a status quo, steadfast in t…",

          "description": "Doing hard things is important. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. And lets be honest. It feels good to hit the bed at the end of the day when you know you worked hard. That self satisfaction is indescribable.\nBut how to do hard things? The answer is 'deliberate mental training'. When I was young I would get lazy, feel bad about myself and then get the work done. If I generated enough momentum it would last long, otherwise it would just last a few days and the cycle would repeat.\nMy perspective changed over the years. I don't know if it was one podcast or one book that did it or a bunch of things. But I came to look at myself more as an intellectual athlete. And just like an athlete needs physical training to get better, I needed mental training.\nA lot goes into an athlete achieving peak performance. Deliberate pracise, the right mindset, diet, the right tools and lets admit it - some genetics. It is the same for an intellectual athlete. Focus on what you can control and get better. The point is to improve 'your' peak performance and not to compete with some genetic freak training since they were born.\nAs far as frameworks go this is both very practical and very powerful. If you are out of shape and want to run a marathon you don't expect to do it one day one. You work up to it. You don't see some pro marathon runner on social media doing insane times and feel discouraged. You know your body is malleable. You can see the fat on it. The pain in your calves when you run. You know it gets better.\nThe same is true for our brains. Mental training makes your brain stronger. Be able to do hard things. To get started and stay focused. To not get frustrated when you hit blocks. All these are part of mental training. Something you get better at. And you need to keep training to not get out of shape. And if you ever go out of shape or get lazy you know you just need to train yourself back up to your glory days.\nStart training.",

          "description": "When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.\nAfter I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.\nAnyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.\nMy photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I'm choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.\nAnyways.\nFor those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:\nJEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.\nNotes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.\nSnaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.\n59/100\nReply by email",

Luckily, there's a solution to the problem:\nStart blogging!\nThere's no better way. Or rather, it's the only way.\nWe might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it's only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.\nWe find ourselves by connecting with others.\nMy first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.\nThis blog is my first \"serious\" one in English. It's still relatively new and doesn't have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I'll start a separate blog about writing online. I don't know; time will tell...\nWhat I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.\nAre you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice?
