Not the citizens of East Palestine, though they too face a challenging quest for the truth about the environmental health threats they may face. But the citizens in and around Uniontown, Ohio have been trapped in such a quagmire for decades, subjected to a dystopian level of gaslighting from the powers that be in an effort to bury the truth regarding the ultra-hazardous poisons reportedly dumped at the town landfill.\nThe Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL) in Uniontown closed in 1980 and was designated as an EPA Superfund site in 1984, listed as one of the most contaminated sites in the country. Akron area rubber companies were the biggest known polluters at the IEL, dumping millions of gallons of industrial waste and chemicals in the ‘60s and ‘70s. But local citizen eyewitnesses have long testified that the U.S. military was another covert client in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s. This includes the IEL’s former owner Charles Kittinger, who came forward in 2001 to speak of clandestine dumping of three metal eggs of nuclear weapons waste he was eerily warned not to speak of.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post What is the EPA Hiding at the Landfill in Uniontown, Ohio? appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.",

CUDA is not designed to be vendor agnostic and Nvidia can make things arbitrarily difficult both technically and legally. For example I think it would be against the license agreement of cuDNN or cuBLAS to run them on this. So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.\nChasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool's errand. The important users of CUDA are open source. AMD can implement support directly in the upstream projects like pytorch or llama.cpp. And once support is there it can be maintained by the community.",

The schematic capture elements to connect up large blocks of HDL with a ton of I/O going everywhere are one of the few applications of visual programming that I like. Once you get past defining the block behaviors in HDL, instantiation can become tedious and error-prone in text, since the tools all kinda suck with very little hinting or argument checking, and the modules can and regularly do have dozens of I/O arguments. Instead, it's often very easy to map the module inputs to schematic-level wires, particularly in situations where large buses can be combined into single fat lines, I/O types can be visually distinguished, etc. IDE keyboard shortcuts also make these signals easy to follow and trace as they pass through hierarch…",

Verizon was up there as well, but, I don't remember specifics.\nThe carrier that I worked with kept only 3 days content of the actual messages, 28 days for the text message metadata, and 28 days for the call records for their enforcement database, but, they could get calling records and sms envelope information for billing back 7 years, and at the time, we had to implement sharding at the database layer that maintained the warrant database due to the amount of traffic that we were receiving from the calling systems and the amount of queries/data that we were sending out, in near realtime, to law enforcement users who paid $10,000/month for access to that data.\nAT&T wasn't storing this data out of the kindness of their heart, it was a (probably small) revenue stream for them.",

          "description": "The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn't miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.\nPerhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn't a failure, it's essential, especially for problems in systems you've never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn't signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.",

They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.\nThe best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.\nAs a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.\nIf there's one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They've done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.",

          "description": "I was diagnosed with lupus a few years ago. My mom also had it and passed away after 10 years due to complications. My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job.\nI did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn’t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation.\nPreviously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free.\nI also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn’t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I’ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation.\nI hope this helps, though it’s just my personal experience.",

          "description": "A family friend of ours recently fell victim to a phishing attack perpetrated by an attacker who paid for Google Ads for a search term like \"BANKNAME login\". The site was an immaculate knock off, with a replay attack in the background. She entered her 2fa code from the app on her phone but the interface rejected the code and asked her for another one. In the background, this 2nd code was actually to authorise the addition of a new \"pay anyone\" payee, and with that her money was gone[0].\nI have accounts with 2 banks, one uses SMS 2fa and the other uses an app which generates a token. I had thought that the app was by default a better choice because of the inherent lack of security in SMS as a protcol BUT in the above attack the bank that sends the SMS would have been better because they send a different message when you're doing a transfer to a new payee than when you're logging in.\nSo really the ideal is not just having an app that generates a token but one that generates a specific type of token depending on what type of transaction you're performing and won't accept, for example, a login token when adding a new payee. I haven't seen any bank with that level of 2fa yet, has anyone else?\nI guess perhaps passkeys make this obsolete anyway since it establishes a local physical connection to a piece of hardware.\n[0] Ron Howard voice: \"she eventually got it back\"",

          "description": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is key to this discovery, appears to be super relevant to psoriasis, another autoimmune disease.\nAhR has been known for a long time, but it seems it's been somewhat mysterious until a series of recent breakthroughs. In 2022, an AhR inhibitor called tapinarof, sold as VTAMA, was launched, and has shown itself to be one of the most effective treatments for psoriasis to date. It's also unique in that it appears to have the ability to bring lasting remission. In the main clinical trial, patients who used VTAMA for one year and then stopped had a mean remission duration of 4 months until their psoriasis returned. That is unheard of for any topical medication used on psoriasis.\nBlocking AhR has also shown promise in treating MS [1].\nI haven't read the lupus paper, but often with papers like these, the \"cause\" turns out not to be the actual origin, but some cytokine or other protein that is more disease-specific than current drug targets. This lupus discovery appears to identify an imbalance that may be compensated for, but we still don't know what triggers the imbalance in the first place.\nIn some cases diseases turn out to be a genetic fault, but my money is on pathogens acting as the initial triggering event, which then spins the immune system into a vicious cycle of autoimmunity. In psoriasis we see this with strep bacteria, for example, but the exact mechanisms are not well understood. However, the mechanism that makes psoriasis chronic has been identified, a type of T-cell called a tissue-resident memory (TRM) T-cell. This type of cell acts as a kind of biological memory for infections.\n[1] https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2023/02/15/multiple-sclerosis...",

Not to mention what happened when I wanted to show the step-by-step debugging of the software to my colleagues.\nIn summary: our modern computer's sheer power are camouflaging poor software performance.

          "description": "I consider myself a pretty fast reader. I typically get through a book way before it needs to be returned back on Libby1. I get 21 days to finish a book (although my friends have reported 14 days), and that is usually plenty of time. With that said, I’ve never stressed about finishing a book in time.\nUntil now.\nIt’s taking me forever to finish A Court of Silver Flames by Sarah J. Maas. It’s not that it’s a terrible book but I haven’t been finding enough energy to read lately. I even switched to listening on Spotify Premium, and I’m still not done.\nAnyways.\nThe return due date has come and gone, but I’m still not done with the book. For those who are familiar with the ACOTAR series, it’s pretty popular right now so the wait time is pretty long. I was on hold for several months for each book in the series… and I’m registered in three libraries. Doing another hold on this book means I’m going to have to wait months again.\n💡 Enter the Kindle / Libby workaround.\nI read my e-books via my Kindle Oasis and/or Kindle Paperwhite. To avoid the book auto returning on its due date, I just put the Kindle where it’s downloaded on Airplane mode. Voila! The book is there until you connect back to the Internet.\nIf you have a ton of books you want to get through way past your deadline, this is the way to go.\n📙 Bonus hack: did you buy a Kindle with ads? Typically you have to pay $20(?) to get it removed. I just called Customer Service and told them that some of these ads are inappropriate for the minor who also has access to my account. They removed it for free. Now my Kindle screensaver is the cover of the book that I am currently reading.\nYou’re welcome, and happy reading!\nIf you have your own tips and tricks, feel free to reach out to me in however way you feel most comfortable!\n🖊️ And while you’re at it, please say hello in my Guestbook if you haven’t done so already!\n11/100\nReply by email\nA service that allows you to borrow e-books (and other media formats) from your public library.↩",

(but i knew that that would be particularly difficult to do on such a tight schedule).\nhonestly, before my trip, i was 100% convinced i’d hate being on the ocean for such long stretches of time. and this is still partially true now that it's over. i’m prone to motion sickness and i’m afraid of a slow death. i ended up partially bedridden for three days, so i was right to worry about the former. i couldn’t eat anything but apples, and i threw up everytime i moved from my bed. it sucked, but at least i'm not dead.\nwhen i recovered, i discovered that it was ironically grounding to stroll the topmost deck and see nothing but blue and horizon. and that it was especially beautiful at night, even if you couldn't really see the stars at all. instead, i’d watch the water long enough for it to look like a fingerprint. then, even longer to find the unicorns in the sea foam. i found myself returning to the same thought each time: in the grand scheme of all things, i am fortunately very small. i will never run out of earth to explore. nothing is never really just nothing, but nothing feels as good as finally being home too.",

          "description": "It took me a while to get settled into this particular space of mine on the Interwebs. I didn't know what I wanted out of it, but over time (past few months) it just kind of grew into its own thing.\nNotes by JCProbably started out as just a place for scrappy thoughts, and scattered notes. Nothing too serious. It was hosted on a different platform, while what I called my \"primary\" blog (titled: With Love, JCProbably) was hosted in another1. That one included my microposts that I labeled as musings.\nWhen starting this Notes subdomain, I initially said2\nI'm hoping to use this page as a more scattered note, a digital post-it of some sort, when I think of things... and possibly just start linking more coherent thoughts when I write my Week Notes to it.\nAfter the May challenge, I started writing more in this space. By June, I transferred it to Bear (where you're reading this now), and I'm in a much more comfortable space when it comes to writing and blogging.\nAnyways, all of this to say that I am also looking into (re)adding my short-form thoughts and musings here (to consolidate everything). I've come to accept that I don't need to always have a long-winded post about a specific topic on here.\nSometimes I really just want to write a few sentences about how I'm feeling, or ponder on some thoughts, and calling it a day.\nThese posts will be tagged #musings — in case you were curious (but probably not). And no, those will (hopefully) not be as long as this ended up to be. I'm also hoping to include just every day photos that are a little bit more casual3 than what I post on my site specifically for photos.\nOkay, that's it.

          "description": "A non-stressful day at work is hard to come by. I am constantly straddling the fine line between being burnt out, and just flipping a table and walking away. At the end of the day, those two feelings are basically the same side of a coin.\nI work remotely full-time, for the most part. Sometimes I travel for workshops, but that’s mostly just at the beginning of kicking off a new product that I’ve been asked to build. Any other time, I’m mostly working in my home office, which has become my favorite place in the house, yet the place where I stress out the most.\nI spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I’m in meetings probably 5-6 hours a day. With a majority of my current team in Central and Eastern time zones (2-3 hours ahead of me), sometimes I also forget to take a break and eat. It’s easy to lose track of time when I’m focused on solving this problem or that.\nI also forget to breathe.\nThe weather finally cooled down yesterday, and a little bit today before we hit another heat wave. LSC constantly encourages me, and at times pushes me to go for a walk. Take a walk around the block, and just breathe. We practice breathing together, inhaling and exhaling. Inhale the fresh air slowly, keep it in for a few seconds, exhale slowly. Then we go back in the house, and I feel a tiny bit better.\nSometimes we get into what we’re doing so deeply that we forget the essentials. We forget to breathe. We don’t notice it until we’re drowning, and it’s even harder to get back to the surface. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder to stop what you’re doing, take a walk if you can, and breathe.\nSo hey, let this be a reminder.\nGo for a walk. Inhale that fresh air. Hold it in. Exhale.\n7/100\nReply by email",

It contextualises Cypriot anarchism within the broader wave of political ideas making their appearance after the island’s de-facto partition in 1974, tracing the formation of the first anarchist groups and the circulation of early Cypriot anarchist publications.

It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursive signifiers, through which the mediation of a fixed meaning is structured and social reality is experienced. This research…",

Retrieved on 03/07/2024 from lib.anarhija.net.\n\n I am sending the following text to Athens lawyer Dimitrios Katsaris in order for him to deliver it to his client and my co-accused Giorgos Karagiannidis, in order to read it out in the courtroom during the testimony procedure. \n I realize absolutely that what a relative of mine testified during the witnesses’ testimonies was done with the best of intentions.
