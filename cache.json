So at his next rally he shouted only ”Alles für…” and let them add the missing word. Openly racist and viciously anti-immigrant, his party pushed most other parties in a similar direction – to keep their voters.

In a single day, X lost 22 million users, while alternative platform Blue Sky gained 2 million new Brazilian users in just three days. The order to ban the platform initially came from Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, a figure vilified by the Bolsonaros and the international far right, and was ratified by a 5-0 vote in the Supreme Court's 1st working group three days later.

That is understandable, since Gustave Eiffel’s master piece has been the emblem of the city for a long time. However, the tower is also a symbol of the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie, the “capitalist class”, a patriciate whose exclusive ranks also happen to include the ladies and gentlemen of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). A soupcon of history may help us to understand the centrality the tower in the recent Olympic extravaganza in the “city of light”.

          "description": "Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?",

In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.",

This means that if workers’ pay had kept pace with productivity, as it did in the three decades after World War II, it would be roughly 40 percent higher than it is today. […]",

          "description": "This has been playing out for many years. And it's all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive's mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.\nWhen IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:\nThe Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.\nhttps://nwu.org/nwu-denounces-cdl/\nWhen the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.\nHe also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see https://blog.archive.org/2023/12/15/brewster-kahle-appeal-st...). It's not. It's the logical outcome of one man's seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.\nIn addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society. I truly hope the organization can survive.",

          "description": "I had a discussion with someone recently about how tech is enabling enforcement of laws/policies/etc at a scale never before possible and how that is a bad thing. The problem is that people can't conform perfectly and the tighter we force people to conform the more likely they are to 'break' and disconnect from society. Basically, if 'acceptable' is so narrowly defined that you can't achieve it 100% of the time, why try even a little to conform? In companies there is somewhat of an off-ramp, quit (which isn't always a realistic option obviously), but these enforcement abilities are invading areas that we can't avoid and that is a real problem.",

The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.\nThey don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board.\nWithout talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up.",

I jokingly call it \"Sol's fast five\" but the name is actually pretty on point.\nI take a step back, look around me, and pick out the first five things I can reasonably achieve in less then a day prioritizing things where I have all the tools and materials at hand. These 5 things are never entire projects, the goal is to maximally decompose the projects until each action is as close to trivial as possible.\nOnce I have my list of 5 things I stop thinking about anything else and strictly work towards those 5 goals. There is a sense of relief in having reduced the scope and the tasks tend to be finished very quickly. Checking them off the list always feels good.\nOnce I have completed my 5 items I start a new list and pick out the next five items. This can feel like a huge reward.\nI've used this system to great effect in the past few years.",

          "description": "I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.\nI feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.\nI mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.\nThere was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.\nI missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.\nSo here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.\nSide note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?\n53/100\nReply by email",

I was supposed to be on the island at 8:30 AM, but the mistake meant I would arrive at 11:30 AM instead.\nThree hours wasted, and I was supposed to visit six different clients. I could just see myself coming home very late, if I even managed to catch the last ferry back.\nOnce I got there, it turned out that all the houses were close to each other. The houses were also small, so each visit was short. When I was finished with the last customer, she offered to drive me back to the mainland in her boat.\nThe day ended with me finishing ridiculously early.\nSo, why am I telling you this? Because it's so incredibly stupid to paint scenarios in advance when we don't actually have a clue. We imagine how...\n...the workday will be long.\n...the job interview will go badly.\n...the family dinner will be stressful.\n...the date will be awkward.\n...the weather will be a disaster.\nAnd then it turns out in the end that those thoughts weren't accurate at all. The sun came out and during the job interview, it turned out that we had a mutual friend, so it felt very relaxed and good.\nIt's so much unnecessary time and energy that we spend trying to predict what hasn't happened yet. Things we can't possibly know in advance.\nOf course, it's good and even necessary to plan certain things in advance. To do your research and prepare. But it easily gets out of hand or is used when it doesn't serve any sensible purpose.\nWe might tell ourselves that \"you want to be prepared for the worst,\" but is that really a wise strategy? Isn't it better, sometimes, to face the future with an open mind and open arms? That attitude in itself might even increase the chance that it all ends in a surprisingly positive way.\nLet’s embrace the unknown and see where it takes us.",
