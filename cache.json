          "description": "Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.",

          "description": "A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.",

          "description": "As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

Ours is interesting because it's a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: https://sonauto.ai/\nOthers do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion…",

A concussion can impact the inner ear part of that equation, so your brain is overly reliant on sight and touch to compensate. This can cause all kinds of common concussion symptoms: Dizziness, sensitivity to screen time, etc.\nAnyways, after giving us the rundown my partner was prompted to do a few simple exercises to test concussion symptoms. One of them was to stand on one leg and track a moving pen with her eyes. She'd done OK on some of the previous exercises but this one took her out, she lasted maybe 5 seconds and was completely exhausted and dizzy for the rest of the day because of it.\nWe ended up with a physical-therapy-like balance exercise plan that she stuck to regularly for a few months, and it ended up getting her to complete recovery.",

Insanely fast paced looking back.\nI had a habit of hiding my face in little hard to spot places of sites I worked on in very low contrast. Over my five years there I worked on probably hundreds of sites.\nA couple weeks after I'd left for my new gig, I get a message from a coworker that a different coworker had pushed up an untested change that broke the navigation on one of their biggest clients. The HTML had become malformed in such a way as to make the entire page a repeating pattern of my very low contrast face, which had been hiding under the navigation.\nThe client thought it was some sort of hack.

The 'Redditization' of the world means that sharing thoughts is met with hostility. No longer can you just throw something out there, no matter how stupid. These days you have carry an entire encyclopedia with you in order to back up every last thing you say and if you utter anything that isn't deemed 100% perfect by those listening, the social scorn will fall upon you.\n> It's bizarre.\nIs it, though? Once you've felt said social scorn enough you no longer see words as a way to make friends, so turning to beauty is the natural progression. People like to be around beautiful people – or at least so it appears to those looking from the outside in, right? If that doesn't work, then you can easily fall into a cycle of thinking \"maybe this next surgery is the one that will make me beautiful enough!\"",

She doesn't share her actual thoughts and gets angry when asked about it. You might be reading this and thinking that there's more to it, but sadly there isn't. It's her life so I leave her alone, not my place to tell her what to do, and the emotional upheaval from her isn't worth it either.\nBut it's crazy that a person can get this lost in life and become completely devoid of purpose and meaning. It's one thing to have an issue and work through it slowly, but it's something else to isolate yourself and live your life through others - while those \"others\" prosper from your own ignorance.\nI'm sure her past experiences are playing a role in this behavior, but the whole cosmetics things - I know for a fact there are a lot of influencers who peddle this crap, and if you lack self-awareness then I can see how easy it is to get stuck in this cycle.

The products have become so widespread and influential that they change the very culture of our society for the worse. It doesn't matter whether you abstain from using Instagram or not, some of your friends will still be more or less subtly influenced by its existence in your social interactions.\nThere's a nice quote from Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, which IMO hasn't aged at all in 60 years: \"Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the 'content' of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind... The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance.\"",

In the 90s version of this hysteria, Congress passed a law that would have prevented access to education medical information, dirty curse words, and other filth from being published on the internet to protect the children. The federal government fought a case all the way to the Supreme Court to enforce it. If they had won that case, the internet would look very different today. But the Supreme Court got it right when they said it would squelch free speech.\nYou may not like FB, IG, TikTok, etc.. I certainly don't care for any of these products. But these are communications platforms. Restricting the right to free speech does have negative consequences... from the development of critical thinking skills; development of technical skills; and limiting of educational information. Being exposed to shit on the internet teaches you there's bullshit on the internet, and not to believe everything you see.\nAnd just like the Supreme Court wrote 30 years ago, the answer is the same today: if you don't like these products and feel they are negative, then don't use them. Restrict your children's access to these platforms.\nI certainly dont believe anyone should be forced to use these platforms. I don't use any of these products, and havent since they launched.

With so much technology and so many things going remote (I'm not just talking jobs, but I'm talking about the fact that it's very easy, for example, to never need to walk into a store anymore. I recently went to a fast food restaurant and there were no customers inside at lunchtime, normally a busy time, and I ordered on a kiosk and everyone else just ordered at the drivethrough) it's harder and harder to just see random people and our friends without explicit planning.\n2.

          "description": "LiteFS author here. I don't disagree with any points in the article but perhaps a reframing could help. I previously wrote a tool called Litestream that would do disaster recovery for a single-node SQLite server and I still think it's a great default option for people starting new projects. Unless you're doing very database-specific things, most SQL will carry over between SQLite and Postgres and MySQL, especially if you add ORMs in the mix. Pick the one that gets you writing code the fastest and you can switch down the road if you need it.\nRather than a paradigm shift or hype, I see distributed SQLite as an extension of a path that devs can go down. With Litestream, the most common complaint I got was that devs were worried that they couldn't horizontally scale with SQLite and they'd be stuck. While you probably won't hit vertical scaling limits of SQLite on most projects, it still caused concern. So LiteFS became a \"next step\" that a dev could take if they ever got to that point. It doesn't need to be your starting point.\nAs for the \"hacky\" solution of txid, I'm not sure why that's hacky. Your application isn't required to use it or the optional built-in proxy but it's available if it fits your application's needs. It also works for plugging legacy applications into distributed SQLite without retrofitting the code. The proposed solution of caching seems orthogonal to the discussion of distributed application data. I don't think any database provider would suggest to avoid caching when it's appropriate but there's plenty of downsides of caching. Hell, it's one of the two hardest problems in computer science.",

          "description": "Early on in my engineering career, there are a handful of times I was assigned to a project where I was set up to fail. I didn't understand the situation until far too late. There are a few tell-tale symptoms: I didn't quite understand what I was supposed to do; I didn't really know how to do it; and I didn't understand how the assigned work actually solved a higher-level problem. No one else did, either (these situations usually represent a failure of management.)\nAs those projects dragged on and I was unable to make \"progress\", whatever that meant, I felt shame and a mounting dread of returning to the console each day. Eventually, fortunately, I was able to roll off them (not having accomplished much in the preceding month or two) and got back to doing useful things.\nThese days I can usually recognize such projects in advance, but it's still not always possible to avoid them.",

          "description": "The defensiveness has absolutely nothing to do with better computers and the improvements in play that came with it, but with tournaments where risk taking is an economic disaster. As others have said, there aren't massive numbers of ties in the candidates tournament, because the difference in value between being first and second is so massive that if you aren't first, you are last.\nCompare this to regular high level chess in the Grand Chess Tour: It's where most of your money is going to come from if you are a top player. Invitation to the tour as a regular is by rating, and there's enough money at the bottom of the tour than the difference between qualifying or not is massive. Therefore, the most important thing is to stay in the tour train. Lose 20 points of rating, and barring Rex Sinquefield deciding to sponsor your life out of the goodness of his heart, you might as well spend time coaching, because there are so few tournaments where there's a lot of money.\nThis also shows in the big difficulties for youngsters that reach 2650 or so: They are only going to find good enough opponents to move up quickly in a handful of events a year where people with higher rating end up risking their rating against them. See how something like the US championship is a big risk for the top US professionals, because all the young players that show are at least 50 points underrated, if not more.\nThis is what causes draws, not computer prep. Anand was better at just drawing every game in every tournament back when he was still on the tour, and yet computers were far worse than today, especially with opening theory.",

          "description": "Just look to Chess. The top players today are way better than any of the greats before, because they can train against computers and know exactly where they failed. That said, because they've gotten so good, chess at the top levels is pretty boring... it's hard to come up with a unique strategy so players tend to be defensive. Lots of ties.\nOn the other hand, chess is more popular than ever. It's huge in high schools. I see people playing it everywhere. I know that for me, I love being able to play a game and then view the computer analysis afterwards and see exactly what I did wrong (granted, sometimes a move can be good for a computer who will know how to follow through on the next 10 moves, but not necessarily good for me... but most of the time I can see where I made a mistake when the computer points it out).\nSide note: I play on LIChess and it's great. Is there an equivalent app for Go?",
