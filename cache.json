          "description": "(Guest Post by Failed Scholar)\nSome of the shit I read coming from the UK is just…it’s hard to believe it can be true, it’s so retarded. Britain is truly a shining example to the world of exactly how NOT to run a country, a benchmark in deindustrialization and how to drive a society to ruin while turning it into a Gestapo fun house at the same time on behalf of a genocidal foreign country. It takes true talent to make that possible.\nJust before 7.15pm more than 20 uniformed police, some equipped with tasers, forced their way into Westminster Meeting House. They broke open the front door without warning or ringing the bell first, searching the whole building and arresting six women attending the meeting in a hired room.\n\n– Imagine arresting Quakers on behalf of a foreign genocidal state!

Women last longer than men (woman are better at all extreme endurance feats I am aware of.)\nIt’s been about two months since Israel cut off all food and water to Gaza. There were storehouses and some food, and it took about 30-40 days to exhaust the stores, but even before that there wasn’t enough.\nAnd even before this cut-off there wasn’t enough. There was a brief period after Trump took power with supplies moving in in large amounts, but since the start of the crisis, Israel has been choking off food, medicine and everything else, and Israeli citizens have stopped and hijacked aid trucks.\nSo there aren’t any fat people in Gaza, except for some Zionist genociders who cosplay as sol…",

          "description": "Getting elites attention\n\nWhat the right wants from its followers is for them to be riven by hatred of any difference, thus making them easy to manipulate and willing to sell out their economic values in exchange for seeing brown people beaten, and women and trans people losing control over their own bodies.\nWhat neoliberals want is for their followers to be convinced that each group, even each micro group, is on its own, unable to understand each other and thus that solidarity is impossible and all one can hope for is that some member of the identity group is allowed to join the elite, while most of all groups remain in poverty.\nThey’re very similar, really. In both cases hatred of other groups is inculcated as the core value, as a way of making manipulation easy and avoiding having to actually deal with broad issues of well being.\nBoth of these are variations on “divide and conquer”. It costs a lot less to give a few people something than to give many people something. “Want some women and minorities in power? Sure. Costs us almost nothing.”\n“Want women to be forced to bear rape children and die in pregnancy due to lack of necessary abortions? Sure, costs us nothing. Our women can still get abortions.\n“Want trans people excluded and denied health care? Sure, they’re a tiny part of the population and rich trans people will be fine.”\nOn the other hand giving everyone healthcare would cut a lot of profits. Giving everyone a liveable wage or assistance to those who can’t work or find jobs: that would cost a lot of profits.\n“You can have anything you want, as long as it doesn’t make elites poorer.”\nOn that the right and center are unified.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

          "description": "Stumbled on this chart recently:\n\nKind of tells its own story.\nIt’s worth reading the Communist manifest. People have weird ideas about it, but a lot of it is really unexceptionable. For example, Marx and Engels demanded pensions for old folks.\nCapitalists looked at this and said, “oh, we can do this if the alternative is worse” and introduced them. Someone as hard headed as Bismarck responded this way.\nThe threat of a credible enemy ideology which treats ordinary people better than capitalists do forces capitalists to change. For a long time we haven’t had that, but the single party “Marxist but with capitalism” CCP offers another, and yes, they do, overall treat their workers better, as well as being better at capitalism than capitalists. No one is as obsessed with how markets actually work as Marxist economists.\nLet’s look at another of my favorite charts:\n\nOh hey, having powerful organizations taking the part of workers matters.\nSomething happened right after Reagan took power:\n\nStrikes involving more than 1,000 workers\n\nThen there’s this:\n\n(The numbers have gone down since then, but are still vastly high, and far, far higher than China.\nBreak the unions and lock up the people who won’t obey bullshit (aka. drug) laws.\nClass war is real, and constantly ongoing, and elites have won that war.\nPower and fear is all that capitalists ever respond to.\nAlways remember that.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

          "description": "Back during the pandemic two things happened with students. Overall they committed more suicides, BUT when schools were closed, suicide rates went down. (I predicted the latter at the time.)\nThen there’s this lovely chart:\n\nWell, well, well. Seems forcing people to do what they don’t want to do, in what is usually a socially oppressive environment, is bad for them.\nThere are, of course, those who thrive in school, and love it, usually the socially dominant kids. But for a lot of kids, school is Hell.\nThis has a lot to do with alignment of goals, I think. I wrote recently about the epidemic of AI cheating and how to avoid it, but I think the smartest commentary I’ve seen on AI cheating, and cheating in general is this one:\nHas anyone stopped to ask WHY students cheat?
