Capitalists always wind up buying the government, and the only solution is a Great Depression sized catastrophe to reset the wealth of capitalists. But then, over time, they will capture the government again.\nThis isn’t to say much good may not be done at various times. Usually after things get bad enough, a generation winds up in power who is determined to make government work “for the people” because they’ve seen what happens when it doesn’t. War, revolution, poverty, depression and so on. The second generation staggers on. They don’t really understand in their bones that government must be made to work for the people, and they compromise, but they keep it more or less going. Then the third generation says “hey, if we …",

Open source, and open standards. Everyone outside North America and maybe Europe is going to prefer that and those who set the standards control the tech. On top of that, American AI is frighteningly expensive: no one in the US is making any money. Every query costs more to produce than is earned, even from customers who are paying, let alone all the free accounts.\nDeepseek is much less expensive per query, however. The idea of capitalism is to, y’know, make money?

This requirement is why Japan was forced to sign the Plaza Accords, which basically destroyed their future. Oh, life in Japan is fine now, but it’s no longer the roaring Tiger of the 80s.\nBut America has lost its place, which is why China was able to laugh in its face when Trump tried to use tariffs against it.

          "description": "While researching a post I promised on why France collapsed so quickly in World War Two I came across this video on the Russo-German Reinsurance Treaty. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It will give you a much more balanced view of the man–you’ll not be looking at him through the lens of World War Two or World War One for that matter.\nFinally, I think all of us can agree that Disney Star Wars has been 90% joke. All except for Rogue One and the recently completed season two of Andor. As the Critical Drinker says, season two is “the kind of TV your sitting on the edge of your seat in complete silence knowing this is the kind of TV that comes along once every 5-10 years.”\nI’ve re-evaluated my favorite Star Wars movies–not a single TV show, not even the silly Mandalorian makes the top five, except Andor. Obviously A New Hope is number one. Rogue One is number two, Empire Strikes Back is number three, Andor both seasons are #4 and number five is a toss up between Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.  What say you people?",
