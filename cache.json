Alexander Cockburn’s relationship with computers was hostile. Mine was indifferent. I surfed the web, like anyone else, but had no idea how it would be useful for us.

          "description": "In an era marked by unprecedented threats to democracy from rising authoritarian forces, universities—once celebrated citadels of democratic learning and public service—now find themselves caught in a profound political and ideological siege. Rather than championing social justice or fostering spaces for rigorous intellectual exchange, many institutions have shifted their priorities to profit, silencing dissent and embracing market-driven models that serve a predatory capitalism, thus betraying their democratic mission. This crisis has deep roots, but the recent onslaught by far-right politicians and a reactionary billionaire elite is without precedent in its intensity and scale. This trend weakens the humanities and liberal arts, stripping higher education of its capacity to serve as a democratic public sphere and robbing it of the potential to cultivate socially aware students who challenge injustices and hold power to account. Increasingly, higher education runs the risk of becoming either right wing indoctrination centers or dead zones of the imagination.

The point of a strike is to demonstrate the value of your labor by withholding it. Withholding your labor in a slow week would be counterproductive. Strikes (just like any effective form of protest) are supposed to be inconvenient, so in saying what you said, you're really just expressing you don't like strikes. Having this blow up in election week is a risk the Times knowingly took in not meeting their workers' needs sufficiently, and drawing out the negotiations as long as they have.

          "description": "Personally - just let the developer own the machine they use for development.\nIf you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.\nI have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.\nYes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).\nYes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).\nYes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.\n---\nThe only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.\nIf you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)",

If they can't do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.\nAgreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart's law. [0]\nIn the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.\nConsequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won't use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They'll only use those dashboards.\nWhich then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.\nHelping a colleague doesn't show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn't on the sprint board? Fuck that.\nWhich is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.\nAnd then, because this is the work reality you've created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you're left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.\n[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law",

I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.\nHistorically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).\nThe last couple of decades we've seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).\nThis mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.\nThe method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.\nThe whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.",

They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow.\nI've had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done.\nThe dentists there took xrays, etc and didn't find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong.\nWhen I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums.\nThis has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill.

How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?\nThe future promised in Star Trek and even Apple's Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.\nCombining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.\nPath forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.\nI am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.\n[1] https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJsITGzXd0",

Today, 379 days later, Bear has integrated into my routine.\nI publish frequently without any pressure on the quality of my content. I write about whatever random things come to mind.\nI programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.\nI also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.\nOn rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.\nBeyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.\nAfter a year, Bear still feels like a great fit. Herman has created the perfect blogging experience that feels fluid with my digital habits.",

Blogging about it would have been completely unthinkable.\nOn the outside, everything looked peaceful and happy. No problems here! But deep down, I felt terrible.\nWhen I finally realized the seriousness of it and sought help, a whole new world opened up for me. I realized that I was far from alone in feeling this way. Suddenly, it no longer felt wrong or shameful, but human and understandable.\nNowadays, I'm open about both my past and during periods when I'm feeling down. I feel like it helps me, and actually others too. It creates a comforting sense of belonging and a realization that we humans are quite similar after all.\nWe're only human...\nIt's liberating to talk or write about it, it's valuable for our fellow human beings, and we can get strengthening and motivating support. A wonderful example of this is the lovely comments I received in the guestbook and on Mastodon after yesterday's post, Daunting Doubts. Thank you everyone!\nI'm not saying everything is appropriate to share. I'm also not saying that you should force yourself to be open. But sharing that human \"ugly and embarrassing\" stuff we try to hide, I think that's very healthy and valuable.\nSo next time you feel lost, share your shit!",
