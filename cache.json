That relationship is not democratic; it is autocratic. More\nThe post The Undemocratic Reality of Capitalism appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Instrument-rated pilot (and engineer) here.\nFirst - congrats on the launch! I think you're working on an interesting set of components that will prove useful to GA aircraft technology. Bringing fly-by-wire, and lowering the cost of maintenance/manufacturing are both great efforts.\nThat being said, my personal view is that stick-and-rudder control is one of the less critical components to improving GA safety. Everything else - flight planning, comms, automation, navigation, weather, inspections, procedures, regs, and most importantly - working in the federal airspace system - are the \"hard\" parts of flying and where problems tend to occur. It's common belief that single-pilot IFR is the most challenging type of flying, because of how much you have to do all at once.\nIt may sound snobby - but I'm not super excited about the idea of lowering the barrier to entry for GA on a foundational skill basis. Like the light-sport rating, it encourages more people to be in the (already congested) airspace system who haven't really gained all the other skills necessary or experience to be there.\nTo be clear - I think improving technology and lowering costs = good. Lowering early-skill requirements for pilots and pushing more people without all the other skills into federal airspace = very bad. In general, I'd frame this effort more as an effort to raise the bar for system technology, not lower the bar to become a pilot in the first place.",

          "description": "We face a number of challenges simply letting our paying customers change their search engine:\n1. On iOS the list of allowed search engines is simply baked into OS, we have a fiddly extension that hooks outbound calls to /search and redirects them but I wish we didn't need to.\n2. On Chrome, we use an extension to change the default search engine and enable search auto-complete etc, but Google has a policy that such an extension can do one thing and one thing only, and recently removed our extension on account of that [1]. We rebuilt it to meet their needs but had a lot of back-and-forth because we included 'search by image' on a context menu item and the first reviewer felt that was a bridge too far. You'll note that Chrome provides such a context menu item for Google Image search out of the box.\n3. On Chrome for Linux, the default search engine API is not available, so Linux users have to configure it manually through a series of silly steps [2]. This is at least in keeping with most Linux experiences.\nThere are other issues, but I say all this to highlight how surprisingly difficult it is to change this setting in a practical, consumer friendly way. It is most certainly this difficult by design, that's a lot of revenue to protect.\n1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41028924\n2: https://github.com/kagisearch/chrome_extension_basic?tab=rea...",

Plenty of people live rich, productive, fulfilling and engaged lives that don't especially involve a lot of interactions with other people.\nThis author is clearly someone whose habits were impinged by the changes brought on by the pandemic (\"... naturally outgoing people – this writer included – have found it that bit harder to get their friends out of the house.\"), but is that the end of the world?\nIt almost feels like the author is eager to get back to what they are comfortable with, at the expense of (by their numbers) 1/3 of other people's lifestyles. It's almost like they are the ones afraid of this change — like they are the selfish ones.\nBut I don't really go for the whole us-vs-them approach at all. It has been a great (if forced) learning experience. Some people got to discover happiness they didn't know before. Other people felt the loss of something they took for granted. Perhaps we should share these lessons with each other and bring some balance and increased awareness, rather than pointing fingers and taking sides.",

Everything was FTPed around as obscurely named tarballs.  We had gathered something like 27 different forks of gdb floating around the net, for example.  This was back when forking was generally considered a tragedy, something I managed to change five or six years later).\nRich Pixley came and said “all of our code should be in revision control, and I want to use this newfangled thing called CVS.”  Michael was OK with it but John and I were steadfastly opposed.  We agreed to an experiment, grudgingly, subject to a whole whiteboard of absurd conditions (“must be transparently integrated into emacs so we don’t have to know it’s there).\nPixley agreed to all of that and then ignored all of it completely.  It was immediately such a win that everybody adopted it without complaint, including us two obstreperous a-holes.\nA few years later a preventable crisis was how revision control first became client-server.",

The solution was obvious: installing Visual Studio for each customer on site and teaching the users to run the app in debug mode from Visual Studio. I don't know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done.\nWhat happened next was even worse.\nThere was no version control of course, the code being available on a shared disk on the local network of the company with the code copied over in multiple folders each having its own version, with no particular logic to it either, V1, V2, V2.3, V2a, V2_customer_name, V2_customer_name_fix, ...\nAfter that, when there was a problem for a customer, the programmer went there to debug and modified the code on site. If the bug/problem was impacting other customers, we had to dispatch some guys for each customer to go copy/edit the code for all of them. But if the problem was minor, it was just modified there, and probably saved on the shared folder in some new folder.\nWhat happened next was to be expected: there was no consensus on what was the final version, each customer having slightly different versions, with some still having bugs fixed years before for others.",

I'm not sure if he didn't know about them being something that had already been invented, or whether he just didn't know Perl supported them, but either way, he reimplemented them himself on top of scalars (strings), using $foo and $foo_offsets. For example, $foo might be \"romemcintoshgranny smithdelicious\" and $foo_offsets = \"000004012024\", where he assumes the offsets are 3 digits each. And then he loops through slices (how does he know about slices, but not arrays?) of $foo_offsets to get the locations for $foo.\nBy the time I was done refactoring that 12k+ was down to about 200 ... and it still passed all the tests and ran analyses identically.",

          "description": "My worst codebase story:\nIn my first real job, I worked for a company that maintained a large legacy product programmed in a combination of COBOL and Java.\nIn order to work on the Java side of the product, you checked out individual files from source control to work on, which 'locked' the files and prevented other developers from checking out the same files. This functionality was not part of our actual source control system, but was instead accomplished with a series of csh shell scripts you could run after ssh'ing into our development server.\nEach of our customers had a 'master' jar file that represented the actual final compiled product (a jar file is really a zip file archive, which bundles together the resulting compiled java class files).\nOnce you had finished implementing your code changes, you ran another set of scripts which found the master jar file for each customer, unzips it, copies the compiled files from your local machine into it, and zips it back up again. Finally the source control lock is released.\nThis means, effectively, that the codebase was never compiled as a whole at any point in the process, instead, we just manually patched the jar file over time with individually compiled class files.\nOver the years, small errors in the process allowed a huge amount of inconsistencies to creep into the codebase. Race conditions would allow two developers to lock the same file at once, or a developer would change a class that was a dependency of some other code that somebody else was changing. Sometimes code changes would make it into some of the customer jar files, but not others. Nobody knew why.\nIt took a small team two years to migrate the entire codebase to git with proper CI, and a huge chunk of that time was reproducing a version of the codebase that actually compiled properly as a whole. After the project was finished, I resigned.",

Whenever we interacted with them it would be a small chit-chat, exchange small updates (how's your son doing, is he married yet?) and then finally do the actual purchase.\nIt was to an extent that the carpenter would come by and just hand over a big dining table just because he thought our house deserved/needed it. He wouldn't ask for immediate payment either and also in instalments. Some other times he would come by and borrow some money.\nAll of that is now gone. Every single interaction I have now with vendors is 100% transactional. I don't even know their names nor they mine.\nIt means that I'm now connected only with my immediate family, that's it.

          "description": "Visualizing large graphs is a natural desire for people with lots of connected data. But after a fairly small size, there's almost no utility in visualizing graphs. It's much more useful to compute various measures on the graph, and then query the graph using some combination of node/edge values and these computed values. You might subset out the nodes and edges of particular interest if you really want to see them -- or don't visualize at all and just inspect the graph nodes and edges very locally with some kind of tabular data viewer.\nIt used to be thought that visualizing super large graphs would reveal some kind of macro-scale structural insight, but it turns out that the visual structure ends up becoming dominated by the graph layout algorithm and the need to squash often inherently high-dimensional structures into 2 or 3 dimensions. You end up basically seeing patterns in the artifacts of the algorithm instead of any real structure.\nThere's a similar, but unrelated desire to overlay sequenced transaction data (like transportation logs) on a geographical map as a kind of visualization, which also almost never reveals any interesting insights. The better technique is almost always a different abstraction like a sequence diagram with the lanes being aggregated locations.\nThere's a bunch of these kinds of pitfalls in visualization that people who work in the space inevitably end up grinding against for a while before realizing it's pointless or there's a better abstraction.\n(source: I used to run an infoviz startup for a few years that dealt with this exact topic)",

And while there are still things to be desired (sum types, better enum/range types, immutability, and non-nilness in my personal wishlist), Go is still the most enjoyable ecosystem I've ever developed in.",

The actual hazard distance is shorter, but still, kinda crazy.\n(as for why i have a laser welder - i got it cheap and besides the downsides above, it is very easy to weld ~anything without much skill.  A person who has never welded in their life can weld sheet metal and have it come out basically perfect in 5 minutes)",

It's like independent music. You're writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.\nIt's pretty punk, actually.

It's the ideal theme in my opinion.\nRecently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: \"It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It's so incredibly boring!\"\nI'd never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It's true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.\nAnyway, that, combined with Lou's post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It's always exciting and inspiring to try something different.\nI plan to use Bear's official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I'm also considering some larger changes as separate 'add-ons'.\nIf I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it.

          "description": "I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.\nBut there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can't help but hire you. Can't help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.\nThis is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.\nWhat happened to being that intense 'Steve Job' type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.\nIt goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don't just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.",

I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I'm afraid I'll have to settle for almost there. I'll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.\nSchool aside, there's nothing much to write about today. The sky's been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good.
