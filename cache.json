That relationship is not democratic; it is autocratic. More\nThe post The Undemocratic Reality of Capitalism appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.",

This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.",

If we don't consider the CEO's influence, I'm actually curious if the location of company headquarters has to do with the average age of the employees in the Bay Area. As the employees start to have families, they most likely move to the south bay for better or for worse, and I have a hard time imagine that they'd enjoy commuting via BART or Caltrain for more than an hour every day. And this is probably just me or my circles, a city's hustle and bustle becomes a distraction or at least increasing irrelevant as I age. I increasingly enjoy ample parking space, tranquil suburbs, being able to step out and start jogging in woods or huge parks, and certainly not having to deal with the craziness on SF streets. If more people are like me who prefers living outside of the city proper, then I'd imagine a company will have access to more talent by moving its headquarters to the south of SF.",

          "description": "Good job releasing your project! It's a cool idea and surprisingly minimalist. That said, I've found a number of cryptographic flaws in the application source. This should not be used in instances where the encryption is mission-critical.\n1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it's far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.\n2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.\n3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.\n4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (\"#\") which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it's important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the \"#\". If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).\n[0]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L99\n[1]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L287\n[2]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475.pdf\n[3]: https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/",

          "description": "Instrument-rated pilot (and engineer) here.\nFirst - congrats on the launch! I think you're working on an interesting set of components that will prove useful to GA aircraft technology. Bringing fly-by-wire, and lowering the cost of maintenance/manufacturing are both great efforts.\nThat being said, my personal view is that stick-and-rudder control is one of the less critical components to improving GA safety. Everything else - flight planning, comms, automation, navigation, weather, inspections, procedures, regs, and most importantly - working in the federal airspace system - are the \"hard\" parts of flying and where problems tend to occur. It's common belief that single-pilot IFR is the most challenging type of flying, because of how much you have to do all at once.\nIt may sound snobby - but I'm not super excited about the idea of lowering the barrier to entry for GA on a foundational skill basis. Like the light-sport rating, it encourages more people to be in the (already congested) airspace system who haven't really gained all the other skills necessary or experience to be there.\nTo be clear - I think improving technology and lowering costs = good. Lowering early-skill requirements for pilots and pushing more people without all the other skills into federal airspace = very bad. In general, I'd frame this effort more as an effort to raise the bar for system technology, not lower the bar to become a pilot in the first place.",

Mozilla and Apple will lose significant revenue from having Google as the default search engine and Google will no longer have to pay those billions. What's more, no one else can pay to be the default either (eg the short-lived Mozilla Bing deal).\nSo what's going to happen? Most users will probably still use Google, nobody is getting paid and Google is saving a bundle.\nI get the thinking that you have to prevent lock-in (eg Ticketmaster and venues) but Google didn't buy its way into dominance annd maintain their dominance through exclusivity deals. They simply have a better product and I don't expect anyone to match them anytime soon (cue the DDG \"I switched from Google to DDG 78 years ago\" crowd).",

On iOS the list of allowed search engines is simply baked into OS, we have a fiddly extension that hooks outbound calls to /search and redirects them but I wish we didn't need to.\n2. On Chrome, we use an extension to change the default search engine and enable search auto-complete etc, but Google has a policy that such an extension can do one thing and one thing only, and recently removed our extension on account of that [1]. We rebuilt it to meet their needs but had a lot of back-and-forth because we included 'search by image' on a context menu item and the first reviewer felt that was a bridge too far. You'll note that Chrome provides such a context menu item for Google Image search out of the box.\n3. On Chrome for Linux, the default search engine API is not available, so Linux users have to configure it manually through a series of silly steps [2]. This is at least in keeping with most Linux experiences.\nThere are other issues, but I say all this to highlight how surprisingly difficult it is to change this setting in a practical, consumer friendly way. It is most certainly this difficult by design, that's a lot of revenue to protect.\n1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41028924\n2: https://github.com/kagisearch/chrome_extension_basic?tab=rea...",

I don't know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done.\nWhat happened next was even worse.\nThere was no version control of course, the code being available on a shared disk on the local network of the company with the code copied over in multiple folders each having its own version, with no particular logic to it either, V1, V2, V2.3, V2a, V2_customer_name, V2_customer_name_fix, ...\nAfter that, when there was a problem for a customer, the programmer went there to debug and modified the code on site. If the bug/problem was impacting other customers, we had to dispatch some guys for each customer to go copy/edit the code for all of them. But if the problem was minor, it was just modified there, and probably saved on the shared folder in some new folder.\nWhat happened next was to be expected: there was no consensus on what was the final version, each customer having slightly different versions, with some still having bugs fixed years before for others.",

          "description": "Probably some of the worst code I ever worked on was a 12k+ line single file Perl script for dealing with Human Genome Project data, at Bristol-Myers Squibb, in the late 1990s.\nThe primary author of it didn't know about arrays. I'm not sure if he didn't know about them being something that had already been invented, or whether he just didn't know Perl supported them, but either way, he reimplemented them himself on top of scalars (strings), using $foo and $foo_offsets. For example, $foo might be \"romemcintoshgranny smithdelicious\" and $foo_offsets = \"000004012024\", where he assumes the offsets are 3 digits each. And then he loops through slices (how does he know about slices, but not arrays?) of $foo_offsets to get the locations for $foo.\nBy the time I was done refactoring that 12k+ was down to about 200 ... and it still passed all the tests and ran analyses identically.",

The excuse for not taking responsibility is that there are \"language standards\" saying that these bugs should be blamed on millions of programmers writing code that bumps into \"undefined behavior\"\nBut that's not an excuse for having a bug; it's the exact evidence that it's not a bug at all.

          "description": "My worst codebase story:\nIn my first real job, I worked for a company that maintained a large legacy product programmed in a combination of COBOL and Java.\nIn order to work on the Java side of the product, you checked out individual files from source control to work on, which 'locked' the files and prevented other developers from checking out the same files. This functionality was not part of our actual source control system, but was instead accomplished with a series of csh shell scripts you could run after ssh'ing into our development server.\nEach of our customers had a 'master' jar file that represented the actual final compiled product (a jar file is really a zip file archive, which bundles together the resulting compiled java class files).\nOnce you had finished implementing your code changes, you ran another set of scripts which found the master jar file for each customer, unzips it, copies the compiled files from your local machine into it, and zips it back up again. Finally the source control lock is released.\nThis means, effectively, that the codebase was never compiled as a whole at any point in the process, instead, we just manually patched the jar file over time with individually compiled class files.\nOver the years, small errors in the process allowed a huge amount of inconsistencies to creep into the codebase. Race conditions would allow two developers to lock the same file at once, or a developer would change a class that was a dependency of some other code that somebody else was changing. Sometimes code changes would make it into some of the customer jar files, but not others. Nobody knew why.\nIt took a small team two years to migrate the entire codebase to git with proper CI, and a huge chunk of that time was reproducing a version of the codebase that actually compiled properly as a whole. After the project was finished, I resigned.",

          "description": "The findings of the original study were called into question by a larger 2018 study[0]. The original study had 90 students. Some folks did a study with 900 people. They found the same correlation that the original study did. But when they controlled for household income, they found most of the correlation disappeared.\nThe obvious conclusion is that household income is a predictor of both:\n- inability to delay gratification, and\n- higher academic achievement\nThis makes sense when you consider that someone growing up in a poor household may have both:\n- less reliable/continuous/predictable access to material things, meaning they would rationally seize immediate opportunities rather than taking the risk of a larger future opportunity, and\n- less academic support\nNow, this new study (OP) goes even further, finding that the correlation itself is weak.\n[0] Watts, T.

Whenever we interacted with them it would be a small chit-chat, exchange small updates (how's your son doing, is he married yet?) and then finally do the actual purchase.\nIt was to an extent that the carpenter would come by and just hand over a big dining table just because he thought our house deserved/needed it. He wouldn't ask for immediate payment either and also in instalments. Some other times he would come by and borrow some money.\nAll of that is now gone. Every single interaction I have now with vendors is 100% transactional. I don't even know their names nor they mine.\nIt means that I'm now connected only with my immediate family, that's it. It also means that the generation now growing up know only transactional way of interaction with non family/friends. I guess these things eventually add up to the loss of community.",

Most of the interactions adults have in their lives are with or in the framing of economic relations. Homes, are being invaded with tablets and mobile devices which bring along with them framing interactions as economic relations through ad and consumer frames. Workplaces are inherently settings of economic relations, and third places outside of the consumer setting are becoming extinct because they are non-monetizable.\nThis last category, non-consumer third places are formerly the domain of kid-friendly community-building activities. When we talk about creating more of these and the response is, \"they aren't economically viable,\" it's exactly the kind of economic calculus framing that I'm talking about.",

Most days, I sit down in front of my computer (or phone) and allow myself to just type, see what comes out, and then refine. Other times, I write intentional posts about topics that I have been ruminating on. Then there are moments when my emotions run so strong that I have to express them before I explode. I guess such was the case yesterday.\nOf course, there are other ways. I have a list of topics I want to get to one day, but those have been mostly ignored. They overwhelm me too much.\nAnyways, that's not the intention of this post.\nThe best topics come to me in the most inopportune times, and so half the time, they never see the light of day.

I started driving away and caught myself...\nBut what about me? I'm basically the same.\nI don't live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.\nHow often do I think about it? Hardly ever.\nYet, it's something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.\nOkay, it's never going to be like \"the first high\" again, but that doesn't matter.

The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.\nTalking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.\nI have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.\nEvery day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.\nI just need to figure out how.\n6/31 - Blaugust\nReply by email",

I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.\nSo why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I've always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me.

I've only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.\nReally, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It's like independent music. You're writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.\nIt's pretty punk, actually.

It's the ideal theme in my opinion.\nRecently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: \"It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It's so incredibly boring!\"\nI'd never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It's true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.\nAnyway, that, combined with Lou's post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It's always exciting and inspiring to try something different.\nI plan to use Bear's official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I'm also considering some larger changes as separate 'add-ons'.\nIf I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it.

          "description": "I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.\nBut there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can't help but hire you. Can't help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.\nThis is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.\nWhat happened to being that intense 'Steve Job' type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.\nIt goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level.

So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.\nThis isn't just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world. There was even a time when I wanted to try to write a self help book, to understand the world and life in general, more effectively.
