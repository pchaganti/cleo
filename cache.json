It works.\nBut for things like paper towels or Tide or whatever, it's utter chaos. Multiple listings for the same item, sizes and quantities that mysteriously move from one listing to another, prices that vary 10x or more...\nIt's utterly baffling to me why Amazon created this consumer-hostile nightmare. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, but everything home and toiletries I buy from Target online, simply because the listings and prices are totally consistent. Even though I have Prime! I don't understand why Amazon doesn't figure out that Prime consumers like me buy from Target instead because Amazon's household supplies listings are such utter unpredictable garbage, while Target just works like a normal store.",

After internally assessing the finding we have determined it is a known low risk issue. We may make this functionality more strict in the future, but don't have anything to announce now. As a result, this is not eligible for reward under the Bug Bounty program.\n> GitHub stores the parent repository along with forks in a \"repository network\". It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository's visibility changes (Eg. public->private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits/blobs from being readable via another network member.",

How convenient would it be if people could shout \"Alexa order me Tide Pods\" from wherever they were in their home and the order got magically processed? That demo definitely got applause from a boardroom full of execs.\nThe problem is that consumers don't behave like that. This is also why Amazon's Dash buttons failed. I always want to see a page with the product details and price before I click \"buy\". Reducing the number of clicks is not going to make me change my decision and suddenly order more things.\nIf they want to salvage Alexa, they need to forget shopping and start doubling down on the smart home and assistant experience. The tech is still pretty much where it was in 2014. Alexa can set timers and tell me the weather, and...that's basically it.

I thought of calling it 'information,' but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it 'uncertainty.' When I discussed it with John von Neumann, he had a better idea. Von Neumann told me, 'You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.'\"\nSee the answers to this MathOverflow SE question (https://mathoverflow.net/questions/403036/john-von-neumanns-...) for references on the discussion whether Shannon's entropy is the same as the one from thermodynamics.",

If you follow the link to the “hooks” that Windows eBPF makes available [1], it’s just for incoming packets and socket operations. IOW, MS is expecting you to use the Berkeley Packet Filter for packet filtering. Not for  filtering I/O, or object creation/use, or any of the other million places a driver like Crowdstrike’s hooks into the NT kernel.\nIn addition, they need to be in the kernel in order to monitor all the other 3rd party garbage running in kernel-space. ELAM (early-launch anti-malware) loads anti-malware drivers first so they can monitor everything that other drivers do. I highly doubt this is available to eBPF.\nIf Microsoft intends eBPF to be used to replace kernel-space anti-malware drivers, they have a long, long way to go.\n[1]: https://microsoft.github.io/ebpf-for-windows/ebpf__structs_8...",

I've heard the same polite euphemisms refering to Arabs and Gypsies from the mouths of members of the Front National. You know, before 1945 it was said in Europe that Jews weren't able to integrate fully with the host society.\nOne might ask: Was that the Jews' fault? Or the host society's fault?\nIt's a relevant question. You are blaming it on the particular group of migrants involved in the case of Europe right now. But historically Europe has ghettoized other groups.\nWhen the US ghettoized Chinese economic migrants, American politicians claimed they could never integrate. And yet the Chinese-American population is well integrated and hugely successful since the host society allowed it. Same with Jews in America, and increasingly with Hispanics.\nWhy is it that economic migrants do, after a few generations, become successfully integrated in America, while they tend not to in Europe?\nI don't think the evidence definitively supports the conclusion that it's down to which group. Europe has a problem with integration that has its roots in the ethnic character of its states (something America does not have), in deep-seated xenophobia that causes social exclusion of immigrant or out-groups, and in the fact that its states' reasons for existence are based on tribal boundaries and wars for territory rather than on achieving broader democratic and economic flourishing by harnessing the capability of the whole population. And thus Europe presents neither a dream of integration nor a path toward integration (as in, \"to become American\"; there is neither an equivalent aspiration nor option \"to become French\"). And then, once again, Europe blames the groups it refuses to accept.",

It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha.

To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.\nI don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.\nI overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase\nI write code because its fun. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.\nI love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.\nI rely a lot on intuition.\nI’m not a fan of TDD.\nI value data structures over algorithms.\nI don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.\nI prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.\nI'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math\nThat's it for now :)",

I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!\nAlso, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.",

It makes it more interesting.\nHowever, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It's a balancing act.\nIntroducing Komments.cloud\nFull disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.\n\n\n\nKomments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let's call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.\nHow does it work?  Simple:\nWrite your blog post as normal in Bear\nCreate an page in Komments.cloud for user comments\nAdd a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments\nDone\nIf anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.\nThere's more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.\nWorks everywhere\nYou can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.\nBear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.\nVideo\nHere's a two minute video on how to add commenting to a Bear blog post.\nGive it a go\nFancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?\nOh, and it's completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.\nComments welcome",
