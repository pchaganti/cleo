          "description": "As a programmer of over 20 years - this is terrifying.\nI'm willing to accept that I just have \"get off my lawn\" syndrome or something.\nBut the idea of letting an LLM write/move large swaths of code seems so incredibly irresponsible. Whenever I sit down to write some code, be it a large implementation or a small function, I think about what other people (or future versions of myself) will struggle with when interacting with the code. Is it clear and concise? Is it too clever? Is it too easy to write a subtle bug when making changes? Have I made it totally clear that X is relying on Y dangerous behavior by adding a comment or intentionally making it visible in some other way?\nIt goes the other way too. If I know someone well (or their style) then it makes evaluating their code easier. The more time I spend in a codebase the better idea I have of what the writer was trying to do. I remember spending a lot of time reading the early Redis codebase and got a pretty good sense of how Salvatore thinks. Or altering my approaches to code reviews depending on which coworker was submitting it. These weren't things I were doing out of desire but because all non-trivial code has so much subtlety; it's just the nature of the beast.\nSo the thought of opening up a codebase that was cobbled together by an AI is just scary to me. Subtle bugs and errors would be equally distributed across the whole thing instead of where the writer was less competent (as is often the case). The whole thing just sounds like a gargantuan mess.\nChange my mind.",

The culture at the time was built around RAID - the internal bug datadbase and that there should be clear prioritization for everything.\nThe inability to decide between enterprise cloud and consumer client devices held Microsoft back.\nBallmer had customers asking for enterprise cloud in 2000 but he kept listening to people talking about lifting windows sales by 10 percent with search integrated to the desktop.\nAnd then they chose the bloated  SQL server for that and wondered why that couldn't run on normal consumer hardware in Longhorn.\nThe fundamental tradeoffs between something that sacrifices generalization for specialization and efficiency meant that what is good for running server rack NASDAQ didn't work for low powered laptops.\nFrom a low level employee perspective Ballmer was the ruthless guy that wanted people to hate each other at work as they fought for survival lord of the flies style but was pikachu surprised that we could never deliver integrated experiences that worked together.\nSatya's two key abilites to me were the ability to actually prioritize in a coherent way and the decision to bring the rank and file infighting down because integrated experiences are hard to build when you want your brother and sister departments to fail so yours gets more budget because thats how Ballmer worked.",

The entire company was designed to promote Windows.\nThis was the fundamental flaw with Microsoft that Nadella changed. He quickly not just made Windows just another part of Microsoft’s business, to a great extent he actively devalued it.\nThe fact that Ballmer invested in Azure, etc before Nadella would all be irrelevant because under Ballmer Azure would have remained a red headed step child to Windows, so it’s unlikely to have seen much success under him anyways. Same goes for pretty much everything else Microsoft is doing right now.",

I used to see Steve almost every weekday for a couple of years.\nI can't speak to his business skills, but I can attest that he never once offered a tip for his daily black iced tea. We'd even have it ready for him before he showed up so he never had to wait! He would pay with cash, and I'd hand him his change and drink, and that was that.\nIt's funny to me now: one of the richest men in the world and he never once offered a tip.\nFrugality aside, he was always very polite and warm so I can't be mad. Makes for a good ice breaker story.\nEdit: holy moly, this is a sensitive subject. Please remember this was from a time before tipflation. Tipping meant you left your change behind once in a while only if you felt the desire to show appreciation. It wasn't an obligation. Yes, I still do think it's a funny story.

We use their service to host our website. Therefore, nobody on my team can register for a WordPress.org account.\nI wrote an open letter to Matt Mullenweg complaining about the requirement and stating that I believe it violates the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by being an overly broad prohibition that is clearly anti-competitive and has no clear business justification (aside from limiting competition).\nMatt and the rest of the people backing Automattic should take note: Moves like this that destroy your community will eventually usher in a replacement.

It's a Dutch home-care company that was started by nurses who basically got frustrated that managers got in the way of them doing their job. It operates by having a flat organization working with small teams of highly trained nurses, and trusting them to make the right decisions. The result is a low-cost provider of high-quality health-care.\nSo when the author says care \"doesn't scale\", they obviously mean \"you need a one-to-one ratio of caretakers\", which I fully agree with. But what they're also accidentally doing in the process is explaining why creating bigger teams with bigger hierarchies and structures does not appear to increase the efficiency of care.\nSome projects do need big teams with hierarchies - even in healthcare. Effectively responding to a pandemic comes to mind. I suspect it's when the core problem to tackle most naturally breaks down like a tree - a hierarchy then mirrors the way the problem breaks down. For some projects, like general homecare, the efficiency sweet spot is a flat structure of autonomous individual teams, because it doesn't scale beyond those teams anyway.\nAnd just like the author concludes, I find that there's something comforting about that.\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buurtzorg_Nederland\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSoWtXvqsgg",

So I read somewhere that if I focused on something else, it would help me. So for the past years, I played 2048 during takeoff and landing, and it worked. It helped me to focus on something else, not the airplane, and I started to enjoying more my trips.\nNow I don't need to do it anymore, but just for the experience I still do it when I fly.

          "description": "I bought a Lamy Safari, my first fountain pen, a couple of weeks ago. I tend to get obsessed over things when I first get into them, and thus end up in an endless rabbit hole of research. I knew this would happen.\nI go back and forth between purely taking digital notes for work and using pen and paper. For the past few years, I’ve switched to digital note taking because it’s easier to cmd + f to find what I’m looking for. However, with the constant game of musical chairs that is my dual-laptop setup for work, I end up using different applications for notes and, in turn, losing them anyway1.\nAnd so, armed with this new pen I wanted to practice writing with, I decided to switch back to pen-and-paper mode, and back to the work notebook I’ve used on and off since 2017 2.\nThis is where I ran in…",

Thinking about them is a tool I use in my personal gratitude practice, a daily exercise where I record three things I'm grateful for. I have been doing it for years. There's never been a time in my life when I couldn't find some folks with kindness in their heart. Even during the years when I worked as a prison guard, there were inmates who did kind things in a non-manipulative way. I used to drink coffee continually on that job. You could buy a packet of Taster's Choice in the canteen for a dime in those days. An old con who cleaned the area around my desk gave me some sage advice one day. \"Mr Plummer,\" he said, \"Don't e…",

It is a declaration and a resolution. It is one of the most life-changing things you can ever experience.

For most of the samplers below I link their corresponding papers, implementations, and default parameter settings.\nBasics\nLogits and Logprobs\nLanguage models generate text by predicting one token at a time.

          "description": "I used to struggle with explaining why some of my friends or family members didn’t quite fit into any of the 16 MBTI personality types. A friend of mine seemed like an INFP but had traits of an ISTJ, and my cousin felt like an ESFP, yet was as considerate as an ESFJ.\nThen I stumbled upon Personality Ninja (or \"NXT\"), which uses 32 types instead of just 16. Suddenly, things started to make sense.\nAt first, I thought, “What? There are only 16 types!” But after trying it out with friends, I realized their new descriptions actually felt accurate. This system offered flexibility and depth the original 16 types didn’t seem to capture.\nCurious, I dove deeper into whether 32 types could really work—and found out there’s no reason they can’t! If you look back at Carl Jung, who created the concept of cognitive functions, he didn’t enforce the rigid stacks we see in MBTI or the Harold Grant function model.\nPersonality Ninja’s approach allows both the first and second functions to be in the same attitude (both extraverted or both introverted), unlike MBTI’s requirement for them to be opposites.\nThis flexibility means types don’t have to follow TeSi or SiTe formats—they can be TeSe or SiTi. It was the answer I’d been looking for: my friend turned out to be FiSi, while my cousin was FeSe.\nSo if you’ve ever felt stuck trying to fit yourself or others into the 16 types, it might be worth exploring the 32-type approach!",
