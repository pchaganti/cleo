But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China's income level. We quantify China's consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country's production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.",

Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.",

Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.\nBuilding a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It's also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, \"I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life's savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they're coming for my house\", the less they'll want to explore your offerings.",

          "description": "I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.\nThe promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who's behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who's ahead can be nurtured.\nWe had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things \"they shouldn't be\" was just‚Ä¶ insanely frustrating.\nNow in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.",

When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.",

          "description": "This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the \"aliveness\" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label \"life\" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.\nMitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?\nThe implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.",

My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.\nPseudoephedrine is very effective.

There still isn't one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.\nI thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don't have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.\nBy assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it's fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that's okay.\nA small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don't want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.\nHappy blogging!",

These embedding vectors can range in dimension from 512 on the shorter end all the way up to 8192 or more. Typically each of the weights in the vector is represented as a 32-bit floating point number.\nLLMs use embeddings to represent input text, but embeddings can also be used on their own.\nEmbeddings enable you to easily search for pieces of content that have similar meanings by finding t‚Ä¶",

          "description": "My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple's ads for \"Apple Intelligence\" comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly \"save the day\" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.\nThese ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nObviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect \"perfection\" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.",

Anyways, here it is: https://scojjac.com/posts-not-comments/\nI've been noticed online, which is surprising. Scott Jack is the person in question to notice me, indeed he wrote a reply to my blogpost on what I learnt about Bearblog. He raises some good points about one specific section of the post - that being, the part where I mention that I wish there were comment sections.\nMaybe I'm too used to seeing comment sections, what with me growing up in a generation that uses Instagram and TikTok like they're vitamin supplements, and comments come naturally with them. The same goes with blogs, before Bearblog almost every post I saw came with one embedded. That's not to say blogs with comment sections are better, ‚Ä¶",
