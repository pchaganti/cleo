          "description": "The evidence suggests that empires often react to periods of their own decline by over-extending their coping mechanisms. Military actions, infrastructure problems, and social welfare demands may then combine or clash, accumulating costs and backlash effects that the declining empire cannot manage. Policies aimed to strengthen empire—and that once did—now undermine it. Contemporary social changes inside and outside the empire can reinforce, slow, or reverse the decline.

          "description": "Unavoidable evidence of the catastrophic consequences of climate change confronts us at every turn. Record high ocean temperatures. Once-a-century storms that appear every other year. And on and on. In the face of ongoing ecological disaster, international best-selling author Kōhei Saitō asks why our society continues to prioritize corporate profits (and the rapacious expansion on which they depend), and proposes a revolutionary alternative to unfettered capitalism: degrowth communism.\nIn Slow Down, Saitō provocatively argues that any solutions that don’t directly confront capitalism itself—from the COP agreements to the “Green New Deal”—represent dangerous compromises that may ultimately worsen the climate emergency. Because it creates artificial scarcity and endlessly produces commodities based on their value, rather than their usefulness, our economic system itself makes it impossible to reverse climate change so long as capitalism remains in place. The biggest contributor to the problem cannot be an integral part of its solution.\nInstead, Saitō advocates for degrowth and deceleration, which he conceives as the slowing of economic activity through the democratic reform of labor and our system of production. By returning to a system of social ownership, degrowth communism, we can restore the abundance of things that we truly need, and can focus on those activities that are essential for human life.\nWhat would this alternative look like? How do we end mass production and mass consumption without reducing living standards? What do we need to do to redress global inequality without accelerating the rate at which the planet burns?\nFor this launch event Saitō will be in conversation on all of this, and more, with Science for the People editor, and Pilsen Community Books collective member and CounterPunch Radio co-host Erik Wallenberg. This event occurred on May 24, 2024 at Haymarket House in Chicago. More\nThe post Degrowth Communism: Kōhei Saitō appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn't, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists.",

          "description": "I don't know that I completely agree. To some degree, sure — most folks probably don't notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.\nBut my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she'd have no idea what the term \"continuity\" means in this context. She notices that it's easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it's so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there's very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn't need to write down passwords anymore.\nI think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don't have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity — long before my mother did — it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I'm a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.\nI'm also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they're switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.",

          "description": "I'm conflicted.\nIt's absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models \"boring\".\nThe reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I'll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.\nShe can't tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.\nYou can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn't know how to get back.\nYou could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn't notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn't know they even exist.\nAll the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.\nYou might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she's highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It's not that she's unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn't care.\nIt's becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.\nI think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don't buy the pro and they're desperate for selling points in the regular model.\nIf the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.",

This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.\" I would not have used it.\nBut Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.\nDo you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it's own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn't even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.\nSo thanks for all your work making the world a better place.",

You can buy a high-pressure, high temperature six sided press for about US$200,000. A chemical vapor deposition machine is about the same price.\nDe Beers, the diamond cartel, has an R&D operation, Element Six. They sell synthetic diamonds for lasers and other exotic applications. The technology is good enough to achieve flaw levels in the parts per billion range, and to make diamond windows for lasers 10cm across.[1]\nThis is way above jewelry grade.\nOver on the natural diamond side, there's been a breakthrough. The industry used to break up some large diamonds during rock crushing. Now there's a industrial X-ray system which is used to examine rocks before crushing to find diamonds. It's working quite well. A 2500 carat diamond was found recently.[1][2] TOMRA, which makes high-volume sorters for everything from recyclables to rice, has a sorter for this job. This is working so well that there's now something of a glut of giant diamonds too big for jewelry.\nThe finishing processes of cutting and polishing have been automated. The machinery for that comes mostly from China and India.\nDiamonds are now something you can buy by the kilo, in plastic bags.\n[1] https://e6-prd-cdn-01.azureedge.net/mediacontainer/medialibr...\n[2] https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandakooser/2024/08/23/monster...\n[3] https://ikcabstracts.com/index.php/ikc/article/download/4101...",

          "description": "There are a number of concrete problems:\n- syscall interfaces are a mess, the primitive APIs are too slow for regular sized packets (~1500 bytes), the overhead is too high. GSO helps but it’s a horrible API, and it’s been buggy even lately due to complexity and poor code standards.\n- the syscall costs got even higher with spectre mitigation - and this story likely isn’t over. We need a replacement for the BSD sockets / POSIX APIs they’re terrible this decade. Yes, uring is fancy, but there’s a tutorial level API middle ground possible that should be safe and 10x less overhead without resorting to uring level complexity.\n- system udp buffers are far too small by default - they’re much much smaller than their tcp siblings, essentially no one but experts have been using them, and experts just retune stuff.\n- udp stack optimizations are possible (such as possible route lookup reuse without connect(2)), gso demonstrates this, though as noted above gso is highly fallible, quite expensive itself, and the design is wholly unnecessarily intricate for what we need, particularly as we want to do this safely from unprivileged userspace.\n- several optimizations currently available only work at low/mid-scale, such as connect binding to (potentially) avoid route lookups / GSO only being applicable on a socket without high peer-competition (competing peers result in short offload chains due to single-peer constraints, eroding the overhead wins).\nDespite all this, you can implement GSO and get substantial performance improvements, we (tailscale) have on Linux. There will be a need at some point for platforms to increase platform side buffer sizes for lower end systems, high load/concurrency, bdp and so on, but buffers and congestion control are a high complex and sometimes quite sensitive topic - nonetheless, when you have many applications doing this (presumed future state), there will be a need.",

It's just the logical outcome of those models when execs think they can get a bigger bonus by cutting costs by cutting headcounts.\nNow you have new devs coming into insanely complex n-microservice environments, being asked to learn the existing codebase, being asked to learn their 5-tool CI/CD pipelines (and that ain't being taught in school), being asked to learn to be DBAs, and also to keep up a steady code release cycle.\nIs anyone really surprised they are using ChatGPT to keep up?\nThis is going to keep happening until IT companies stop cutting headcounts to make line go up (instead of good business strategy).",

          "description": "Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30's) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.\nI just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other's people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn't out to impress anybody, I just became \"Mr. Dependable\" on any of the teams I worked on.\nThis was the approach that changed everything.\nNow, some ten years later? I'm never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that's it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.\nI found out that if you don't protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You'll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.\nProtect yourself. Protect your sanity. Once you lose it, like OP said, it's very, very hard to get back.\nI hope this helps someone else struggling to break this cycle.",

          "description": "At the end of July, I moved my domain away from Bear Blog, and back to a site hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, thinking I would get to do whatever creative things I wanted to on my own site where I control everything. The site then sat there and did nothing, but that was fine, because I didn't need to have an actual blog, I had cohost1 for any kind of longer-than-a-tweet writing I wanted to do.\nThen two things happened.\nFirst, I got nervous about social media. I feel weird about the way it works and the kind of interaction it encourages, and especially the way endless feeds hijack my ADHD brain. I decided to put all my accounts essentially on hold, including my cohost, and not post for a while, figuring I'd come back eventually. In the mean time, maybe I'd start blogging again?

This building has been tentatively sold, and the new building was recently renovated (and being renovated again, to accommodate studio space) and is much nicer. There will be more people there, a complete change from the silent hallways of the current building.\nBut this building wasn't always this way. At one point it was tough to get a parking spot, and you had to park in a city-owned gravel parking lot next door until something opened up. But many rounds of layoffs has emptied out the building - there are barely 10 people on the first floor alone on a good day. It's quiet, and I've grown used to it.\nThe new building?

          "description": "I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).\nAnd then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.\nEver since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.\nYesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.\nAlthough I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.\nIt was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.\nAnd if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.\n55/100\nReply by email",

You might also get a lot of mockery and derision and not much respect. Where ever I go on the social web, I have to ask myself what my purpose is. There are ways of manipulating lots of different platforms so that the clicker next to your user name goes up. One of the buzz words that gets tossed around on different platforms is engagement. It is usually a quantitative term having to do with the number of likes or followers your \"content\" has. Content is also a buzzword and one I don't like very much. I'm not a content creator.

          "description": "Image Gallery for Bear Blog\nThis gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It's also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.\nActually, the gallery add-on itself isn't very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here's the result (instructions below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nThe gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a \"section\") with the class gallery. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nSince the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nFinally, add the following style to your theme:\n/* Gallery */\n.gallery ul  {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-auto-rows: 150px;\n  grid-gap: 12px;\n  padding: 20px 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.gallery li {\n  position: relative;\n  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);\n}\n.gallery img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n\nThere have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.\nI hope you find the gallery useful!",

          "description": "I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.\nFor those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.\nSo back to the update…\nKey Updates\nChanging the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.\nYou will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).\nThere is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.\nA battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.\nThe long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.\nThe counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.\nUpdated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).\nThe response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!\n…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.\nSample photos\nPhotos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.\nIf you're interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they're shipping these new cameras now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naffiliate code.↩",
