You can work remotely 'sometimes,' with a secret definition of 'sometimes,' operating in the background.\nI found this paragraph to be somewhat galling since, like, if you're sick you shouldn't work at all, you should be focussing on getting well.

I need to interface with manufacturing. So on.\nGuess what? I'm going on 1 year fully remote, and I'm doing great! Turns out, all that fancy equipment can be brought home with you. We deal with a contract manufacturer, and emailing them from home is no harder than emailing them from the office. Instead of being stuck in a concrete jungle, I can go test the product out in a more realistic environment in the park across from my home. It's made me happier, healthier AND more productive. Eliminating 2 hours a day of driving and train rides left me with more energy I can expend on my work! Who'da thunk it?",

But then again, Amazon doesn't claim monopoly on those and one has to assume the risk of working for a place that churns people out and has upper-level management that are hostile to IC's needs/wants.\nPerhaps a better question is - if one can get an offer at other FAANGs and the equivalents... is there a reason to choose Amazon over others?",

The entire organisation is expected to pivot immediately. A new senior leadership team member starts scheduling daily read-outs on project progress, and half the organisation spends the weekend frantically hallucinating project plans into Google Sheets.\n2. Engineering staff react with dull-eyed disbelief on Monday; they knew this was coming, because the same thing happened a month ago, and six weeks before that.\n3. Emails come from HR that there are are new, even-more-labyrinthine approval processes for expenses, and shrinking budgets for anything not directly related to whatever the projet du jour, which will be fed enough to make it look like it's succeeding until the next Friday evening email kills it.\n4. There is wide-spread burn-out across Engineering teams, and people are reduced to reactive, sarcastic automatons.\n5. A creeping understanding seizes the better engineers that things cannot improve; they sign articles of  Armistice, pretend to comply, and start interviewing elsewhere.\n6. An email arrives on Friday night...\n> Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company's still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users.

Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.\n3. Building value > making money\n4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders/equity owners, not employees.\n5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.\nThe management/communication stuff is mostly about working on set/dealing with physical scale.

Puzzle 66 contained 66 unknown bits and had 6.6 BTC deposited into it by the initial puzzle creator. The private key was 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002832ed74f2b5e35ee or 256 bits with mostly zeroes but 66 random ones.\nThe next Bitcoin puzzle, #67, has 67 unknown bits, and contains 6.7 BTC up for grabs: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BY8GQbnue...\nThe previous puzzle by order of difficulty was #64 (not #65, because see below) and was solved on 9/9/2022, so about 2 years ago. In other words, it took about 2 years of compute time to run the 2^66 bruteforcing task.\nPuzzles that are multiple of 5 (#65 or #70) are special: they have twice more entropy. So that private key #65 doesn't have 65-bit of entropy but 130-bit of entropy. And the creator of the puzzle intentionally published their public key on the blockchain. When you know the public key, brutetforcing the n-bit private key only requires 2^(n/2) work. So puzzle #65 with a 130-bit key actually require bruteforcing up to only 2^65 keys.",

For instance, I can give it a logic problem like \"i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially\" and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.\nYes, you probably wouldn't be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.\nside: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.\nMany of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.",

          "description": "Doing hard things is important. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. And lets be honest. It feels good to hit the bed at the end of the day when you know you worked hard. That self satisfaction is indescribable.\nBut how to do hard things? The answer is 'deliberate mental training'. When I was young I would get lazy, feel bad about myself and then get the work done. If I generated enough momentum it would last long, otherwise it would just last a few days and the cycle would repeat.\nMy perspective changed over the years. I don't know if it was one podcast or one book that did it or a bunch of things. But I came to look at myself more as an intellectual athlete. And just like an athlete needs physical training to get better, I needed mental training.\nA lot goes into an athlete achieving peak performance. Deliberate pracise, the right mindset, diet, the right tools and lets admit it - some genetics. It is the same for an intellectual athlete. Focus on what you can control and get better. The point is to improve 'your' peak performance and not to compete with some genetic freak training since they were born.\nAs far as frameworks go this is both very practical and very powerful. If you are out of shape and want to run a marathon you don't expect to do it one day one. You work up to it. You don't see some pro marathon runner on social media doing insane times and feel discouraged. You know your body is malleable. You can see the fat on it. The pain in your calves when you run. You know it gets better.\nThe same is true for our brains. Mental training makes your brain stronger. Be able to do hard things. To get started and stay focused. To not get frustrated when you hit blocks. All these are part of mental training. Something you get better at. And you need to keep training to not get out of shape. And if you ever go out of shape or get lazy you know you just need to train yourself back up to your glory days.\nStart training.",

          "description": "When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.\nAfter I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.\nAnyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.\nMy photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I'm choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.\nAnyways.\nFor those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:\nJEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.\nNotes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.\nSnaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.\n59/100\nReply by email",

          "description": "Like a lot of folks I know through Cohost and gamedev, I've started using Bear for blogging. This means I've left Wordpress behind after nearly 15 years on that service.\nBear is a fantastic blogging service for people who like to touch computers... but don't want to touch computers That Much. It has a web-based post composition UI which takes markdown, which is about all I want. I want to minimize the UI fuckery needed to put words on the internet, and these days, Wordpress is all about UI fuckery.\nI migrated over the vast majority of posts from my old Wordpress site and laboriously set up URL aliases, so all of them should continue to receive any incoming links they had in the past. I also took some time to heal some link rot in the older posts back between 2013-2016 or so... I was linking to a lot of twines which don't seem to be online at all anymore. Where possible, I've left a note about missing content.\nBear provides everything you need to migrate Wordpress content, but it isn't a simple task. The Bear documentation states that it takes the site owner only about 30 minutes to migrate a blog with about 60 posts, but it took me several days of intermittent work. That was mostly because I cared so much about setting up the dates and aliases correctly.\nIf you're seeing this in RSS, then you have proof that the RSS migration worked perfectly as well. (I don't have proof of that yet, which is part of why I'm running this post.) I selected Bear partially because it was so easy for me to confirm that I could set up an RSS alias identical to the one Wordpress had given me--and that whoever was following me from back in ancient days wouldn't lose track of what I was doing over here.\nThank you to Dante and Bruno for showing me this tool! It's 3 USD cheaper per month than my current Wordpress package, and a lot simpler.",

Luckily, there's a solution to the problem:\nStart blogging!\nThere's no better way. Or rather, it's the only way.\nWe might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it's only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.\nWe find ourselves by connecting with others.\nMy first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.\nThis blog is my first \"serious\" one in English. It's still relatively new and doesn't have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I'll start a separate blog about writing online. I don't know; time will tell...\nWhat I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.\nAre you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice?

          "description": "Gingerbread computer  \n\nWhen I inspect houses as part of my work, I always advise homeowners to check their attics a couple of times a year. I also suggest making it as easy as possible to do so, for example by installing a built-in ladder. If it feels too cumbersome to check your attic, it's easy to put it off.\nFor the same reason, I want as little resistance as possible when it comes to blogging. I keep my blog post ideas easily accessible, no matter where I am. When it's time to write, I do it in the default text editor if I'm at my computer, or in my phone's standard notes app.\nAfter translating (I always write in Swedish) and editing the text, I open the browser shortcut to create a new blog post. I preview it and maybe do some formatting. Then I publish the post.\nThe Blogging Workflow\nWhen I read certain blogging workflows, I'm surprised at how complicated they seem. At the same time, I think that for those particular bloggers, the technical aspect is one of the reasons they enjoy blogging. It's not a barrier; it's an example of the importance of interests.\nMy approach of writing in Swedish and then translating into English can certainly be perceived as complicated. But I find it fun and interesting. It took quite a while before I found a way to write in English in a way that I felt good about.\nRegardless of your approach to blogging, make sure it feels easy and fun. \"Easy\" is of course very individual in this case. That's where the \"fun\" part comes in - easy can be technically complicated in a fun way.\n3 Tips for Easy Blogging\nIt should work on any device.\nIt should work no matter where you are.\nIt should be easy to go from writing to publishing.\nWe live in a time of almost unlimited possibilities. Take this opportunity to play around. Find a setup that suits you, and don't be afraid to try new methods.\nKeep on blogging!",

There's even a dedicated \"What to blog about?\" category on the Blog Inspiration page.\nWhile I understand that many feel this way, the \"problem\" for me is rather the opposite: I have so many ideas that I don't know which one to choose.

Even the most trivial moments carry something interesting. It could be something someone says or does, a certain environment, or something I'm engaged in:\nA podcast.\nA book.\nA song.\nA documentary.\nA movie.\nIt's swarming with blog posts waiting to be written, if we're just paying attention. When such a potential post crosses my path, I usually make a note, a voice memo, or take a photo, depending on what's easiest in the context. Currently, there are two photos and three notes waiting to become blog posts.\nOf course, this setup doesn't suit all types of blogs. But I dare say that it's an approach that works for the majority of bloggers.\nHow has your day been? What have you experienced? What people have you met? What have you seen, read, and heard?

          "description": "September is Suicide Prevention Month, and the IndyWeb Carnival theme is \"Power Underneath Despair.\" We are asked to share stories about times in our lives when we managed to come back from low points. This is my contribution.\nAs someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.\nActive alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I'd been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours. I was never the kind of person to keep beer in the fridge for later or to maintain a bar so that I could m…",

          "description": "I did not think I would ever be spinning a blog again. I think I did in the, like, pre-Google Blogger days? Or something? I was 14. I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.\nThis will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized \"here's an important update\" kinda thing but that's a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don't think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.\nSo here's a blog. How often will I post here? I don't know! I don't care! It's actually kind of nice! I don't need to give a shit about it. It's a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don't need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!\nSubscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.\nIf you'd like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.\nThanks for reading and if you're coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active. The community there was something I'll cherish forever.",

          "description": "I love the idea of a digital garden. I first heard about them in an article by Maggie Appleton where she wrote:\nGardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.\nI’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  It's a place where I can experiment with creative projects and test new ideas.\nSome Examples\nThis week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.\n\nNeither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.\nI also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.\nI’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.\nOver time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.\nNone of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?",

          "description": "Hello!\nOnce again I have abandoned my Substack. Will, you say, you've done this before. And, sure, yes. Last time I bailed on Substack I migrated to Blogspot, but I didn't really like the platform much. This platform is much simpler, a lot less busted, and has RSS and Atom feeds. I also like that it has no trackers or JavaScript.\nI've had some weird feelings about maintaining my own Substack for a while now. I just don't think I'm personally cut out for the platform: I don't have a single subject I can write about consistently (and, to be honest, I don't think I can really write consistently at all); I don't like that it's massively metrics-based as I really don't care about that sort of thing; I don't like the constant push to monetize when I've never had any intention of doing that; and, honestly, I was kind of running out of things to say. The fiction I posted just felt like filler so that people would remember the blog existed at all. Sad!\nI'm not entirely sure what's going to go here yet but I'm excited to have what feels like a rather cozier corner of the internet than Substack or Twitter. I've also been remaking my website from the ground up to be less of a professional presence and more of a personal one. I've been having a great time with it. Stay tuned.",
