          "description": "Image by Markus Spiske.\nPublished in 1936, “Shooting an Elephant” remains one of George Orwell’s most celebrated essays. In it, the English writer recounts an incident from his time as a police officer in modern day Myanmar, then known as Burma, part of the British Empire. Responding to calls of a rampaging elephant, Orwell finds the animal docile, but nevertheless feels compelled to kill it, rather than appear weak before the crowd who has gathered to watch. In allowing his conscience to be overwhelmed, he experiences how colonialism dehumanizes not just the colonized, but the colonizers as well.\n“I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys,” writes Orwell. “He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy …. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.”\nAlthough Orwell is writing specifically of the British Empire, he quite clearly intends for his essay to be read more broadly, as applicable to contemporary fascism in Europe as British colonialism in Asia. And so too does his insight extend to today in the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Orwell on the Necessity of Decolonization — for the Colonizer appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

          "description": "While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

It features support for theming, including the use of third-party themes. Additionally, users have the capability to create and apply their own themes directly within the site.\nMoreover, the application is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling it to be downloaded and used as an app on most devices.\nI'm eager to receive feedback on both the implementation and design aspects, particularly from the Hacker News community. Mobile device testing remains a priority for further refinement, so insights in this area would be particularly valuable.\nFor more detailed information and to explore further:\n- Project details are available at https://github.com/wkyleg/brutalist-hacker-news\n- To add or experiment with themes, please visit https://github.com/wkyleg/brutalist-hacker-news/blob/main/th...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39955057\nPoints: 57\n# Comments: 93",

(What happened to the unit tests you ask? Be quiet!

          "description": "I once worked on an in-house ERP system which had been developed over about 15 years by various developers. It was the engine of the entire company, everything passed through it. The CFO and some senior leadership erroneously blamed it for their shortcomings/used it as a scapegoat. When new management took charge, an initiative was started to replace the system with an industry standard solution. Both myself and the CTO (my boss) made it clear that we strongly felt this would not only go way over budget, but ultimately fail as a project.\nHaving no understanding as to the technicalities involved, the project was given the go ahead by the directors after several meetings with a vendor. After the CTO and I expressed our concerns about the scale of the project and the sheer amount of functionality involved, the vendor gleefully assured us that they were experienced with \"migrations of this scale\" and were more than prepared, which was music to the ears of the CFO.\nDaily 2-3 hour meetings followed (for many months) to define the scope of the project. Within each meeting I sort of zoned out because it became very obvious that no only did the vendor not understand the scale of the work involved, but had started cutting corners everywhere/leaving out crucial functionality, and this was just the scoping stage, no development had even started yet.\nI eventually departed the company but kept in contact with the CTO and learned that after 5 years (project was scoped for 2), the migration was abandoned costing multiple millions of dollars with nothing to show for it.",

It features completely overdone features such as TrueType fonts, a cursor, and GUI decorations.\nI first started this project as I was getting a bit tired building a from-scratch GPS receiver, and wanted to make something relatively quick and lighthearted. As tends to happen, this took a fair bit longer than I anticipated at the outset!\nA fair chunk of that time was spent on the visualisations in the post showing how scroll views are modelled and how they’re rendered to a static viewport. I really hope you enjoy them!\nWhen I first began wanting to \"stuff something in UEFI that really shouldn’t be in UEFI\", my first instinct was a Twitter client. As it turns out, someone has already done a great job making this by using UEFI’s HTTP protocol! I therefore decided that whatever I made shouldn’t use HTTP at all, because that’s taken. I went with IRC since it sits on top of TCP and has the same social media feel that doesn’t belong anywhere near a preboot environment.",

Fleet damage was more expensive to repair and took longer. That means more of the fleet is offline at any given time and cost to operate is a bit higher.\n2. Tesla lowered prices forcing them to recognize the depreciation. The cars resale value dropped faster than they anticipated.\nCar and RV rental companies have this problem. People don't want to rent ragged out vehicles. In the case of RVs units for rental are built extra cheap so they don't last anyway. The model is get more in rent then you lose in depreciation then dump the vehicle. In the case of RVs they often turnover the entire fleet yearly.\nThe real killer was no doubt depreciation.

The Acquired episode does, by the end.\nIt works like this: the ‘luxury’ credit card providers, partnering with Visa, take money away from merchants in order to extract profit for themselves while keeping the credit card consumers happy. The merchants are pissed about this, and regularly make lawsuits to regulate interchange. The money extracted by the credit card companies and Visa causes merchants to raise prices for everyone regardless of whether they have a rewards card or use a credit card at all.\nThis creates in effect a massive money transfer from the poor, who do not use rewards cards, to the rich consumers who do. The Acquired podcast provides specific numbers on just how much worse off poor consumers are given this system, and how much the richest consumers benefit.\nI come from Australia where interchange fee regulation tamps down on the kind of credit card mania and fetishism seen in the USA.",

          "description": "> But how far does this go in explaining why merchants \"choose\" to participate in this program. The obvious answer would seem to be that they get no benefit from the system as it exists but have no real choice, but maybe there is a better answer?\nThe simple reason why issuers don’t make every card a signature rewards card is that merchants would revolt.\nThe interchange fee schedule[1] is fascinating. Dozens of categories of merchants with different rates. There is no technical reason for this. Fraud costs are borne by merchants and to some extent processors, but not the issuer banks that receive the interchange fee.\nThe fee schedule reflects a kind of battle for customers. It’s worth repeating that most of interchange for these higher end cards is passed back to the customer in the form of rewards. Essentially, merchants are willing to pay higher fees to support the cards that higher spending customers prefer.\nBut there is a limit. We can observe that not all merchants accept AmEx, which has some of the highest interchange rates. If every visa/MC card were a signature card, more merchants would push back.\n[1] https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/vis...",

          "description": "An interesting article, but it doesn't sufficiently emphasize  the lede:  When you use a reward card, the merchant is charged a higher fee than if you used a \"normal\" card.  Simply by putting a different branding on the plastic you pay with, the credit card issuer gets more money from each transaction.\nThe article goes on to ask the question \"Why isn’t every card a rewards card?\", meaning why doesn't every card pay cash back, but I think the more interesting question is why every card isn't branded in a way that makes the issuer more money.  Why do they bother to issue cards where they get paid less?  Why not brand every card as a \"Signature Preferred\" and then pocket the money instead of giving it to the less discerning customers?\nAnd the most interesting question only gets a handwave: \"The basic intuition underlying rewards cards as a product is that highly desirable customers have options in how they spend their money.\"  But how far does this go in explaining why merchants \"choose\" to participate in this program.  The obvious answer would seem to be that they get no benefit from the system as it exists but have no real choice, but maybe there is a better answer?\nI liked the topic, but wished the author could have given more insight on what's happening behind the scenes to produce the outcome we see.",
