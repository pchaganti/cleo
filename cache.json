In addition, because “fascist” is an epithet as well as political term, it must be used carefully. In 1942, a New Hampshire Jehovah’s Witness named Chaplinsky was arrested after calling a Rochester city marshal a “damned fascist.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the arrest on the grounds that the expression constituted “fighting words,” excluded from constitutional protection. Recent court decisions in the U.S. have widened speech freedoms, but the word “fascist” remains highly charged, underlining the need for historical and political discretion.

          "description": "While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.",

In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.",

          "description": "I've been on tirzepatide (Mounjaro) for 4 months now. I'm down 13% of my body weight. I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I've kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I've started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.\nAll this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it's time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I'm forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.\nI say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I've had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don't know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.",

Timelines will slip, plans will change, software won‘t be ready, prices will change. And that doesn’t even account for where Waymo is in two years from now, or what the Chinese EV industry is able to pull off until then.\nEven this underwhelming event was originally announced on short notice to prop up perception when sales looked bad in April [1], delayed by two‘ish months, and then didn‘t even start on time.

          "description": "After trying various solutions - including DeskPad - I came up with a custom cross-platform (I'm on macOS, but assume it'll work elsewhere) solution that worked incredibly well on my 40\" ultrawide monitor: OBS[1].\nHaving never used OBS before but knowing it was popular among streamers, I wondered if I could use it to (1) only share the specific applications I wanted to share and (2) share them at a resolution that people could actually read, without constantly being asked to zoom in.\nI first tried setting up a virtual camera and sharing via my video stream, but it was laggy and the quality was so poor that people couldn't read what I was sharing. I quickly gave up on that approach.\nThen I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting \"Windowed Projector (Preview)\", it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.\nWhatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.\nIt took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I'm very pleased with how well it works now.\n---\n[1] https://obsproject.com/\n[2] https://obsproject.com/kb/power-of-projectors",

At the time of selling out, the Minecraft Wiki and Minecraft Forum cost tens of thousands of dollars per month to run and so it didn't feel too much like selling out, because we needed money to survive[1]. 15 years later, the internet is a different place, and with the availability of Cloudflare, running high-traffic websites is much more cost effective.\nIf I could do things over again, on today's internet, I like to believe Weird Gloop is the type of organisation we would have built rather than ending up inside Fandom's machine. I guess that's all to say: thank you Weird Gloop for achieving what we couldn't (and sorry to all who have suffered Fandom when reading about Minecraft over the years).\n[1] That's a bit of a cop out, we did have options, the decision to sell was mostly driven by me being a dumb kid. In hindsight, we could have achieved independent sustainability, it was just far beyond what my tiny little mind could imagine.",

Identifying and routing out divergent items (aka ensuring items get more similar as they progress through automation)\n   2. Reunifying divergent paths, instead of building branches\n\nIf you want to go back and automate a class of work that's being routed out, write a new automation flow explicitly targeting it. Don't try and kludge into into some giant spaghetti monolith that can handle everything.\nPS: This also has the side effect of simplifying and concluding discussions about \"What should we do in this circumstance?\" with other stakeholders. Which for more complex multi-type cases can be never-ending.\nPPS: And for god's sake, never target automation of 100% of incoming workload. Ever.

So in the framing of TFA, product are never ever ever under any circumstances going to give a shit about your architecture proposal (because that is entirely in the domain of your concerns). But they may care about how the architecture is going to prevent them from delivering features that are on the roadmap coming up and how you have a solution that can fix that for example (because now you are in the domain of their concerns).  Notice this is not just \"your architecture proposal\", it is how your architecture proposal is going to get them what they want, and if you want to do this you need to think deeply and make sure you really understand what they want, not just what you want.\nYou're not trying to change their mind.

          "description": "Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the \"break it up\" camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.\nAs for the rebuttal of \"bUt ThE gDp\", there's a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There's another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart's Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.\nIt's worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&T and Microsoft's own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.",

A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.\nFor those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more 'serious', 'professional' language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.

Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.\nConcretely related to the topic, I've often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I'll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what's going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.\nMy goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?",

I believe this was because the CRT was grounded on the same ground lines that the mechanism for physically checking a coin had gone through the system.\nSuffice to say, they caught onto this over time, and added some form of an alarm into it.

Reduce, reuse... then recycle.\nRe-using devices helps us also reduce the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we're not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?\nNever the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I've been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5's, 7's, and 8's that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.\nBut tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I've been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It's as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!\nAnd pick up a new hobby if you are able. Support your local tech geeks if you can!",

Satellite radio may, or may not be available as the ground stations that power it require even more advanced transcievers and software to operate and could take months to repair if attacked or destroyed.

If you want efficiency, memory management and a compiled modern language just use Go. Then you won’t even need anything but the standard library for what you want to do.

Wanderers in the wilderness glimpse remnants of the Sun Guard’s emblem carved on ancient stones, the Queen’s face engraved on old metal coins. Little is remembered of what caused the Realm to fail. Harpists sing of a dying Queen seeking the cup of Solace. Others gossip of jealous lovers or sibling strife. What is known is in the last Age, the Sun Guard sallied forth from their Rotunda in the Queen’s Halls in Baelfyre, their eyes yearning for the City’s gleam. They were never seen again\nThey are lost and dispersed, withering in forgotten groves or rotting in hollows. There are rumors that their ancient hall still stands.\nIn these latter days of the fallen queen’s realm, peace extends no farther than a hold’s torchlight. The Forest and Wilderness cast long shadows. The Vale is a remote realm carved out with warrior’s blood on the edge of the empire across the Sea. There is word that lawlessness reigns, with roving warbands terrorizing the countryside and strange mystics shouting apocalyptic prophecies. Nature reclaims the queen’s road. craven opportunists find easy avenues to power\n\nFor the Players\nYou are hedge knights, come to this Land seeking opportunity, your knighthoods fresh as morning dew. You are the children of spring. Your new arms shine in the midday sun. You came to your knighthoods over the long cold winter, called to serve by the Seers and sworn to your oaths.\nDespite whatever burgeoning relationships (good or ill) you may have, you are a Company, newly formed of foreigners sent to a land unseen by your fathers.",

A combination of untreated bipolar disorder and active alcoholism gave me a perpetual frown and a repertoire of caustic comments. Thankfully, I finally sought treatment for both issues, got my life in order, and most people who know me wouldn't describe me as ill-natured at all. I have to admit that in a lot of ways, I have it made. I work because I want to, not because I have to. My wife and kids love me. The rest of my family is self-sufficient and drama-free. I have adequate time for my hobbies.\nBut…\nNobody is perfect, and every once in a while, I succumb to the internal pressure to let things get to me.

In that way, it is structured similarly to Twitter (X), Threads, and BlueSky.\nWhere Twitter and Threads are corporate-owned and centralized, Mastodon is just a platform, and anyone can get the software and set up their own server if they are tech-savvy.

          "description": "If you're a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.\nBut what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.\nStarting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.\nLet go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.\nBegin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.\nWhen the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an \"About\" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.\nStep by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.\nSoon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.\nCommunity echoes\nFW: Blog Like a Painter by Yordi\n(I am) the painter with dried up paint cans by Jedda\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Helen Chong\nRe: Blog Like a Painter by Dominik\nBlog Like a Community by So...

          "description": "I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.\nOne guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.\nWriting forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.\nOf course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).\nOne annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.\nOn the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.\nWhile I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)\nP.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?",

          "description": "\"But I don't know what to blog about.\"\nI often hear that. Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don't know what to write about. My answer is always the same:\n\"Blog your way to the answer.\"\nWe can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.\nBlog, blog, blog – that's the solution.\nWe might come to realize that we don't need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.\nOr maybe we'll realize that blogging isn't our thing at all. Then at least we've tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn't waste our time ruminating about it.\nThe only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It's still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.\nMany of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I'm really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog's small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.\nWho knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don't have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:\nThrough blogging. Not through considering blogging.",

          "description": "I'm sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.\nI've meditated myself in periods. I'm actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.\nFew things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I've tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.\nAm I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the \"technique\" isn't so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.\nIf meditation becomes something that \"should be done\" - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task 'meditation' on the to-do list.\nI leave you with that to meditate on.",
