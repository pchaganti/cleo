          "description": "This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the \"aliveness\" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label \"life\" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.\nMitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?\nThe implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.",

Each time, there was a rug pull, and it went closed again.\nBefore the first rug pull, open source groups routinely added QNX to their target list. There was a Firefox for QNX. Eclipse had QNX as a target. GCC and most of the Gnu command line tools could be built for QNX.\nThere was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.\nAll of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.\nThen, in 2007, QNX went open source. You could even look at the microkernel. It wasn't openly licensed, but you could look inside and build it.\nIn 2010, RIM acquired QNX, and, with no warning, closed the source. All open source development related to QNX…",

These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show; . The unprepared person is able to quickly \"save the day\" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.\nThese ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nObviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect \"perfection\" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.",

Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.\nAmerica was the place to be. We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.\nToday, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.\nI am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).\nI went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.\nA lot will change over these next 4 years.\nBe kind to your loved ones today.\nMany of us need it.\n80/100\nComments and 💬 Community Echoes\n\nNo comments available but here are some 💬 Community Echoes\nRe: Various election posts by reedybear\nCommunity Commiseration by Kevin Humdrum\nReply by email",

Today, 379 days later, Bear has integrated into my routine.\nI publish frequently without any pressure on the quality of my content. I write about whatever random things come to mind.\nI programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.\nI also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.\nOn rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.\nBeyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.\nAfter a year, Bear still feels like a great fit. Herman has created the perfect blogging experience that feels fluid with my digital habits.",

Every time this kind of event happens, I have to tell people I don't own one or I used to. Some people get curious. Some people just don't care. In this case, it was the latter. Ultimately, I always end up wondering if I may have sabotaged potential friendships because I don't own one. However, I have had enough relapse to know that I actually don't care anymore.\nHow it all began wasn't because I understood the negative effects of social media since day one.
