          "description": "Image by Markus Spiske.\nPublished in 1936, “Shooting an Elephant” remains one of George Orwell’s most celebrated essays. In it, the English writer recounts an incident from his time as a police officer in modern day Myanmar, then known as Burma, part of the British Empire. Responding to calls of a rampaging elephant, Orwell finds the animal docile, but nevertheless feels compelled to kill it, rather than appear weak before the crowd who has gathered to watch. In allowing his conscience to be overwhelmed, he experiences how colonialism dehumanizes not just the colonized, but the colonizers as well.\n“I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys,” writes Orwell. “He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy …. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.”\nAlthough Orwell is writing specifically of the British Empire, he quite clearly intends for his essay to be read more broadly, as applicable to contemporary fascism in Europe as British colonialism in Asia. And so too does his insight extend to today in the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Orwell on the Necessity of Decolonization — for the Colonizer appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

Life is hard here so they really aren't paying attention to what happens elsewhere. The irony is that part of why life is hard here is because the resources of the state are being shuffled elsewhere, and the safety net here has been shredded worse than old fishnet stockings. 2,000-pound bombs would fund a lot of healthcare.

          "description": "A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.",

          "description": "As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

          "description": "Hey HN.  Eric Seidel here (former lead of Flutter & Dart at Google, prev. YC S06).\nI founded Flutter and led the team for almost a decade.  One of the constant questions we got was would we support code push like the web/react native: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14330  I left Google about a year ago and set out to build a company around Flutter and decided to start with code push.\nIt took us a year to build.  We had to build a new toolchain for Dart and a custom interpreter (for store compliance).  But it works!  Our beta has already been used by thousands of apps.  Most (eventually all) of the code is open source on GitHub.\nI’ll be around all day to answer Flutter and Shorebird questions.  We run our company in the public on Discord and are happy to take questions there too.  Would love to hear your thoughts.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39973150\nPoints: 103\n# Comments: 47",

          "description": "I'm Brazilian and when I moved back home for a bit the country had recently inaugurated a national exam for all high-schoolers. About maybe a year after, they'd publish an anonymized data set for researchers with a nice question-by-question breakdown of how every student performed. I worked at a school at the time, and one thing we wanted to know was how WE had performed in the questions so we could gauge if there were some things our students were consistently unprepared for.\nThey didn't provide that data, but it turns out with a little bit of grokking and staring at that 10gb text file, you could reverse engineer it so you could extract all the kids of a given school, and aggregate all of their answers. I produced a nice little report for our admins, with the questions of the text next to how we had performed in the aggregate and state averages, as well as averages of our \"competitor schools.\"\nThe best part, though, is how I remember it being a bit \"bullshit\" that we, a private school, could afford to do this, but since the data was actually valuable to inform practice, surely the department of education should do that for every school! Whelp, over the weekend, I computed that info for every school in the dataset, and just stored a CSV for every school in an S3 instance (this was my ridiculous caching strategy lol). Spun up a frontend where you could select your school, and nicely visually go through every question, as well as print a pdf summary of the whole thing. On Monday morning tweeted at an ed journalist, and in a few days had a spread of me in the country's top newspaper, and people emailing about jobs \"at my company.\"\nThis was the most rewarding project I've ever done, and I'm sad to say nothing has come close since. It cost me $0, produced a public good that I could see was being accessed from every state in the whole country, was technically interesting, and I saw it through from start to finish over the weekend!",

It only took 41 years:\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/261148-modern-computer...\nhttps://danluu.com/input-lag/\nBut wait! Not so fast (smile). This benchmark uses the compositor \"raw Mutter 46.0\", not GNOME Shell. Raw mutter is \"a very bare-bones environment that is only really meant for testing.\"\nIn addition, this measurement is not end-to-end because it does not include keyboard latency. In this test, the \"board sends a key press over USB (for example, Space)\". Latencies just within a keyboard can go up to 60msec by themselves:\nhttps://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/\nWhat are the true end-to-end numbers for the default configuration, which is the only situation and configuration that really matters? I wish the article had measured that. I suspect the numbers will be significantly worse.\nI do congratulate the work of the GNOME team and the benchmarker here. Great job! But there are important unanswered questions.\nOf course, the Apple //e used  hardware acceleration and didn't deal with Unicode, so there are many differences. Also note that the Apple //e design was based on the older Apple ][, designed in the 1970s.\nStill, it would be nice to return to the human resposiveness of machines 41+ years old.",

Sure, we’re doing the right thing by quitting PFAS and starting major cleanup efforts.\nBut the system existed where people were incredibly negligent for years, knew they were hurting people, made boatloads of money, and retired. That same system exists in many oil-and-gas industries, drug marketing, and more. There are dozens of examples where this has happened in recent years, and that’s just the ones at large enough scale to be prosecuted.\nIt’s still happening to this day. How do we start treating intentional negligence that leads to mass suffering and death as seriously as murder? It is individuals making these decisions, and they need to be held personally liable.\nThe corporate veil is useful, and shouldn’t go away completely. But when an individual makes a decision that had a high probability of doing major harm, they should at least stop and raise the issue to a government agency, to limit their liability. If they do not take appropriate precautions, like getting explicit approval from government authorities, then they should be personally liable for the negligence.",

          "description": "I'm not sure people in these comments are reading this paper correctly.\nThis seems to essentially disprove the whole idea of multi-agent setups like Chain-of-thought and LLM-Debate.\nBecause this paper introduces their alternative method which simply runs the same query multiple times on the same LLM, without any context shared across queries. And then they run a similarity algorithm on the answers and pick the most common answer. (Which makes sense to me. If an LLM is giving you a mixture of \"hallucinations\" and correct answers, the correct answers will similar and the hallucinations will hopefully be chaotic)\nAnd this simple algorithm preform just as well (and sometimes better) than all the other multi-agent algorithms.\nThis suggests that the other multi-agent schemes with their clever prompts aren't really doing anything special; Their improve results are coming mostly from the fact that the LLM is run multiple times, that the prompt asks the LLM to pick the best answer.",

          "description": "Alright, I spent years working and building 0-1 insurance products. Let me peel back some stuff that’s been happening behind the scenes.\nSome officials are elected and some are appointed which all depends on the state. Appointed officials are usually more reasonable and elected are not because higher rates = mad voters = re-election chances lower.\nFor a long time, insurers have struggled to get sufficient rate changes approved. A literal quote for you during Covid was, “Son, I’m looking out my window at downtown {city} and I don’t see many cars on the road. We won’t approve the rate increases.”\nThis was with actual data of losses increasing due to supply chain disruption of auto parts, labor increases and many more things.\nWe basically had to write policies and hope for the best despite knowing the data / trend lines forecasting major losses.\nFast-forward and what do you have - major losses by all of these companies - and so these companies have two choices: \n- Try to get rate approvals \n- Exit the market or line of insurance\nFor California, the latter is the better option because at least for auto you cannot use credit, telematics or other very predictive attributes to price the risk. This results in essentially pooled risk which in aggregate drives up rates for all. Simply put, California officials did this to themselves.\nFor other states, the first option works but the rate increases are now significantly higher because it was near impossible to get any adequate rate increases last few years.\nSo, the bill has come due and it sucks for everyone as it’s either a) higher prices or b) can’t get insurance (Florida folks for certain types) or c) limited suppliers not being able to get reinsurance to share the risk results in higher rates that customers can’t afford so they go without.",

Place a board on the fixture, pull down an assembly, and six micro-D, two nano-D, MCU and FPGA programming connections, remote thermal and multimeter probes, and a canbus connection with onboard amplifier to traverse the absurdly long cable all slotted with perfect precision into the board and were routed back to a test rack via a single cable bundle. Automated test bench scripts powered on the board, took voltage measurements, programmed the devices, and ran a suite of tests automatically and then printed out a report with a signature block for me to sign at the end.\nThe board experienced no stress, every connector was mated with perfect force at the perfect angles, and it would cut down the amount of time needed to test the hundreds of boards we were going to build by months.\nIt was featured in marketing materials for my employer.\nWe built four of them and with all of the labor they probably cost a quarter million each but would put the program back on track as it was delayed.\nAdditional delays in another part of the program led to the government cancelling the entire thing and we turned over all of our tooling and prototypes to the customer who probably put my fixtures in a warehouse for fifteen years before selling them for scrap value.",

The team had already built a number of APIs exposing controls for these meters as well as various monitoring and reporting interfaces. A UI already existed but it had issues, my job was to come in and fix that and get us ready for release.\nWe worked hard for a couple of months and whipped this thing into shape. Meanwhile a multi million budget was lined up for the marketing launch. Adverts where drafted, installation technicians where trained and merchandising was branded. All systems go.\nIt all drove towards a set in stone deadline and we busted our guts to get there... When the day arrived, there we sat. Ready. All features built, no bugs that we knew of. Ready to hit the 'go live' button. Honestly in 30 years working in the industry, that was the only time I think I've ever been in that situation.\nOur product owner walks into the room and says, \"erm, there's a couple of issues we need to discuss at board level. Hold tight guys I'll be back\".\nSo we sit...\nTwo days later he returns, \"erm, guys... the board aren't sure that this product is on brand.

(What happened to the unit tests you ask? Be quiet! Take the money)\nMy job was to reach deep into their system and bring the data to the surface, roughly speaking\nThing is nobody that worked on the library wanted, needed, or asked for any aspect of what were doing\nThe design for it was written on a whiteboard by the project lead before I joined\nThen the whiteboard was cleaned.\nSo the design was in one man's head\nThat man, the project lead, quit 3 weeks before delivery\nOn handover day  I was a bit afraid, I had taken care to keep good records of my obeying (increasingly unhinged) instructions,  so I was confident I could not be blamed (I was younger and naive-not part of the story)\nBut I fully expected an unpleasant \"you did what with our money? What were you thinking?\" type of unpleasant meeting\nInstead the corporate types sat around a table gushing how wonderful everything was, what a brilliant job we'd all done...\nI was stunned.  I understand now, I learnt that day, that it was in no-one's interest to acknowledge the waste of a million bucks\nComing from academia, as I was more or less, this was a valuable lesson.\nBut utterly worthless software for a million dollars\nI still use some of the furniture I bought with the money....",

          "description": "I once worked on an in-house ERP system which had been developed over about 15 years by various developers. It was the engine of the entire company, everything passed through it. The CFO and some senior leadership erroneously blamed it for their shortcomings/used it as a scapegoat. When new management took charge, an initiative was started to replace the system with an industry standard solution. Both myself and the CTO (my boss) made it clear that we strongly felt this would not only go way over budget, but ultimately fail as a project.\nHaving no understanding as to the technicalities involved, the project was given the go ahead by the directors after several meetings with a vendor. After the CTO and I expressed our concerns about the scale of the project and the sheer amount of functionality involved, the vendor gleefully assured us that they were experienced with \"migrations of this scale\" and were more than prepared, which was music to the ears of the CFO.\nDaily 2-3 hour meetings followed (for many months) to define the scope of the project. Within each meeting I sort of zoned out because it became very obvious that no only did the vendor not understand the scale of the work involved, but had started cutting corners everywhere/leaving out crucial functionality, and this was just the scoping stage, no development had even started yet.\nI eventually departed the company but kept in contact with the CTO and learned that after 5 years (project was scoped for 2), the migration was abandoned costing multiple millions of dollars with nothing to show for it.",
