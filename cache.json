Echoing other Appalachia-raised writers who have recently weighed in, I say to J.D. Vance: you are a hillbilly phony (Caleb Miller). You don’t represent us (Neema Avashia). And you can keep your “elegy” (Ivy Brashear) because hillbillies don’t need one (Meredith McCarroll). Your Hillbilly Elegy is a political platform disguised as a memoir, and I call bullshit.

The actual hazard distance is shorter, but still, kinda crazy.\n(as for why i have a laser welder - i got it cheap and besides the downsides above, it is very easy to weld ~anything without much skill.  A person who has never welded in their life can weld sheet metal and have it come out basically perfect in 5 minutes)",

          "description": "Here's this re-explained with a simpler example.\nImagine you have 1,000 votes. You want to show that your political party got 60% of the vote, so, you claim:\nMy party: 600 votes\nOpposition: 300 votes\nOther: 100 votes\nPresto, we got a good breakdown. The people will buy it....\nIt makes sense that 600 is exactly 60% of 1,000, because this was an artificial example.\nBut in the real world, we don't get 1,000 votes.\nWe get 10,058,774 votes. What are the odds that the % of votes you get is a round number like 60%, or 51.2%? They're infinitesimally small. You're much more likely to get ugly numbers, like 59.941323854% of the vote, unless you choose some artificial percentage and work backward.",

In Alexa, the people running the core ML teams have been in Alexa since it started. Most people in decision making positions just got there first (10-15 years ago)\nThe software engineering paradigms used within the company create brittle rube goldberg machines of events flowing everywhere in the company. Almost all of them are on maintenance mode, where the oncall burns out the engineers and prevents them from creating new products. There is no knowledge sharing between team members. Legacy team members guard their technical platform knowledge to solidify their place on the team.\nThe engineers themselves are not students of computer science, but just crunch out tickets.\nIf Amazon wants to change they need to remove a significant amount of tenured employees, and actually promote young engineers into decision making positions.\nAWS hasnt released an innovative product in a really long time",

If every building is surrounded by a border of 15 meters of roads, that significantly expands the distances that a person needs to travel to get anywhere. This further prioritises cars and drives demand and cultural norms.\nI don't think we should be trying to get away from cars altogether by any means, but I think we should seriously consider banning them almost entirely from city centres. There's still a need for emergency vehicles and goods to be transported within the city, so we would still need some roads, but we could eliminate a considerable number of lanes.",

Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!\nI wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).\nFrankly, I've enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I'd personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it's got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.\nFastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I've now written around a dozen apps with.

          "description": "> Navajo also has a complex phenology [sic], featuring sounds that don’t exist in many other languages. It counts 33 consonants, including affricates and fricatives, and 12 vowels. (By comparison, the English alphabet has 21 and 5, respectively).\nSomeone else clarified this [0] but got flagged to death for being a bit too harsh, but I do think it's worth mentioning because this is used mistakenly as a prominent example of Navajo's difficulty: the raw numbers of consonants and vowels are not particularly extreme in Navajo, and the numbers that TFA cites for English are wrong.\nThey seem to have done a relatively simple analysis of the alphabet, but that's not how linguists think about phonology. The alphabet is our way of representing a much more complex system that underlies English, and English's vowel system in particular is far more complex than the alphabet makes it appear.\nOur total number of consonants sits at about 24—the alphabet alone would make you forget about some of our affricates (ch as in charge) and some of our fricatives (sh as in shush, zh as in vision, th as in theme, dh as in though), plus a nasal (ng as in ring).\nOur vowel system, meanwhile, has anywhere between ~16 in American English to ~25 in Received Pronunciation. Native speakers don't tend to realize just how complicated our vowels are, but getting them wrong is one of the most common ways to get recognized for having an accent.\nAll told, English has between 40 and 49 phonemes (again, depending on accent), which is quite comparable to Navajo's 45.\nI've no doubt that Navajo is harder to learn for most people than English is, but I don't think the phonology plays a big role in that. English's phonology is plenty difficult.\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41097443",

This exercise in setting a purpose is essential because it stays as a reminder of your initial vision about what you set out to do. So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.\nThis isn't just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world. There was even a time when I wanted to try to write a self help book, to understand the world and life in general, more effectively. I have always been enamoured by great ideas. For it is these great ideas, passed down from generation to generation, which have survived the test of…",

I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.\nAnd when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision.

When we moved to California in 2019, I worked in the building right behind Cupid's Span. During lunch time, I would walk down Embarcadero, eat lunch at the Ferry Building, or just go to the building's rooftop to admire the views of the Bay Bridge.\nIt can get a little touristy in this area since at the end of the Embarcadero is Fisherman's Wharf. Most of the time tourists don't venture this far up away from Pier 39 (where the seals are), but sometimes they do because of the Ferry Building.\nI have walked, biked, scootered, and longboarded up and down this strip, and is truly one of my favorite things to see and do.\n\nCupid's Span - Sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.\n\nSan Francisco Clocktower and Ferry building - opened in 1898.\n\nOakland Bay Bridge - the bridge that connects San Francisco > Treasure Island > Oakland.

(I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format.

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.\"\n– Belghast, Blaugust 2024 is Coming\nI hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...\nWish me luck!",
