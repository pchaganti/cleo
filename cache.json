Remember that the purpose of giving advice is just to illuminate options, not to have someone follow what you recommend to the letter.\n5.

If every building is surrounded by a border of 15 meters of roads, that significantly expands the distances that a person needs to travel to get anywhere. This further prioritises cars and drives demand and cultural norms.\nI don't think we should be trying to get away from cars altogether by any means, but I think we should seriously consider banning them almost entirely from city centres. There's still a need for emergency vehicles and goods to be transported within the city, so we would still need some roads, but we could eliminate a considerable number of lanes.",

Including if I know where I am at, where I go, or is there someone who could help me with these apparent struggles in my life.\nIt took me a couple awkward minutes to realize that I'm the only one standing on my feet and not sitting in a car wherever I was looking. I apologized (???) and told them I was heading to a museum, bc I'm a visitor here and that's what we do right? I added a colleague's address and assured them that I'm not \"confused\", and will take an Uber now.\nThis was simply unbelievable in my world; for the next week I observed my colleague, whenever they took me out, or went to somewhere: we never walked outside. From the building to the parking lot, from the destination parking lot to the resto and vice versa.\nToday, of course, I know that there are walkable cities too, I enjoy walking from my Chicago hotel to the office building :-) every single time I enjoy my US visits, but after a couple weeks I can't wait to get back to my 98% car free European life.",

Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!\nI wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).\nFrankly, I've enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I'd personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it's got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.\nFastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I've now written around a dozen apps with. I'm really loving it!\nI hope some of you get a chance to try it out -- let me know what you think.",

          "description": "> Navajo also has a complex phenology [sic], featuring sounds that don’t exist in many other languages. It counts 33 consonants, including affricates and fricatives, and 12 vowels. (By comparison, the English alphabet has 21 and 5, respectively).\nSomeone else clarified this [0] but got flagged to death for being a bit too harsh, but I do think it's worth mentioning because this is used mistakenly as a prominent example of Navajo's difficulty: the raw numbers of consonants and vowels are not particularly extreme in Navajo, and the numbers that TFA cites for English are wrong.\nThey seem to have done a relatively simple analysis of the alphabet, but that's not how linguists think about phonology. The alphabet is our way of representing a much more complex system that underlies English, and English's vowel system in particular is far more complex than the alphabet makes it appear.\nOur total number of consonants sits at about 24—the alphabet alone would make you forget about some of our affricates (ch as in charge) and some of our fricatives (sh as in shush, zh as in vision, th as in theme, dh as in though), plus a nasal (ng as in ring).\nOur vowel system, meanwhile, has anywhere between ~16 in American English to ~25 in Received Pronunciation. Native speakers don't tend to realize just how complicated our vowels are, but getting them wrong is one of the most common ways to get recognized for having an accent.\nAll told, English has between 40 and 49 phonemes (again, depending on accent), which is quite comparable to Navajo's 45.\nI've no doubt that Navajo is harder to learn for most people than English is, but I don't think the phonology plays a big role in that. English's phonology is plenty difficult.\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41097443",

Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.\n“Danziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study—as well as other self-collected data—and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented—it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases”\n[1] Chatziathanasiou, K., 2022.

The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.\nPulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful.

It literally only targets the potential monopolists.\nHowever, virtually every other piece of regulation does the opposite.\nRegulation usually gets trotted out after the downside of doing [new innovation] is experienced. This always happens, because doing something new always involves unknown risk. Most people aren't entrepreneurs and hate risk, so they pass regulation, and the market gets locked down so nothing new happens again. Incumbents and their army of lawyers can easily comply or are grandfathered in, and challengers are permanently disadvantaged. That market is officially dead until the next fundamental leap forward in technology.\nWhat's different now though, is the hysteria over AI is leading regulators to pass this incumbent-cementing regulation before we've even had a chance to experience both the upside and downside, so the innovation never happens at all.\nCombine this with a rapidly aging demography in Europe, and I only see this trend increasing. If there's one thing old people hate, it's risk and doing new things. Meanwhile, those same old folks are expecting massive payouts (social benefits) via taxation of the same private sector they're currently kneecapping with red tape. While ironic, those two trends converging aren't great for Europe.",

Because regulators in the USA are hamstrung, they are used to being able to basically doing stuff that would be illegal if it were in physical stores/pre-existing industries.",

That puts all gold and silver medalists among the top 25% of the participants.\nThat means that \"AI solves IMO problems better than 75% of the students\", which is probably even more impressive.\nBut, \"minutes for one problem and up to 3 days for each remaining problem\" means that this is unfortunately not a true representation either.  If these students were given up to 15 days (5 problems at \"up to 3 days each\") instead of 9h, there would probably be more of them that match or beat this score too.\nIt really sounds like AI solved only a single problem in the 9h students get, so it certainly would not be even close to the medals.  What's the need to taint the impressive result with apples-to-oranges comparison?\nWhy not be more objective and report that it took longer but was able to solve X% of problems (or scored X out of N points)?",

It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

(I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!",

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.\"\n– Belghast, Blaugust 2024 is Coming\nI hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...\nWish me luck!",

Usually interpersonal issues point more to the poverty of the militancy and viability of certain circles of so-called “radical scenes” than anything of consequence. In these cases I would usually not waste my time writing a critique of a second-rate academic who writes for a gener…",

Trump, will bring an increase in fascist propaganda and reactionary attitudes, while also having serious societal repercussions for marginalized groups and political dissidents. While anarchists typically, and rightfully, disparage engagement in electoral politics, the occurrence of this event will likely have effects far beyond just the 2024 United States election. The main focus of this article is to engage with the likely fallout and effects of such an assassination attempt, rather than discuss the actuality of the attempt in a substantive manner. \n Lik…",

Refounded in 1977 after Italy’s “Hot Autumn,” they have been the second-largest and most workplace-focused IWA section for a long time after the Spanish CNT. They have a reputation for avoiding sectarianism, prioritizing solidarity, and maintaining cool heads. Together with the CNT and the German FAU they organized the recent Bilbao Conference of revolutionary unions, and were expelled from the IWA shortly after. [This and all other footnote…",

Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…",
