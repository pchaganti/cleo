          "description": "Last week, the Department of Energy, which oversees the aging nuclear site in Hanford, Washington, reported that a tank containing high-level radioactive waste was leaking.  This is currently the third tank we know of that’s releasing deadly nuclear waste into the soil above the groundwater that feeds the nearby Columbia River. This is not a new problem for Hanford, which has 177 of these huge underground tanks that contain 55 million gallons of radioactive leftovers from the US’s nuclear weapons operation. These waste tanks were only supposed to hold up twenty-thirty years, and we’re now going on six decades. Below is an excerpt from my book Atomic Days, which details the site’s sordid history and its extremely problematic future. Sadly, leaks at Hanford are nothing new, nor are the lies surrounding them. It’s a looming nuclear danger that’s bubbling in our own backyard, and I’m scared. You should be too.

Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.",

On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:\ncgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet\nand CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use\nthe same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a\nsource of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!\nAutomated cgroup driver detection\nIn v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate\nKubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI\nimplementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes\nhappened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations\n(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!\nIn addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their\nCRI implementation is new enough:\ncontainerd: Support was added in v2.0.0\nCRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0\nThen, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the\ncgroup_driver they would like to use.\nFuture work\nEventually, support for the kubelet's cgroupDriver configuration field will be\ndropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn't new\nenough to have support for this feature.",

          "description": "\"I don't want to work in IT anymore.\"\nI saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.\nI had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!\nBut over time, something started to feel off. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.\nThen one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.\n– Yes, I can't imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.\nIn that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!\nWhen I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.\nFast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.\nAnd when it comes to IT, I'm more passionate about it now that it's a hobby instead of a career. It's fun again!\nAre you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.\nChok Dee, as they say in Thailand.",

At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.\nI just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.\nI’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.\nI haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it.

          "description": "The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.\nThis time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”\nMy heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”\nSurely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.\nSometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”\nIn all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.\nI just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”\n~ dreams by fleetwood mac,\n<3 K\n🍄\nhttps://marblethoughts.bearblog.dev/",

When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.\nI think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible.

If you consistently feel like \"this is the wrong place for me,\" I strongly believe you should quit as soon as possible. I've personally quit jobs within the first week.\nGiven that work occupies a significant portion of our lives, it's crucial that it feels right.

And, as we all know, life isn't always a constant joyride. Relationships can strain, health can deteriorate, and unexpected financial problems can arise.\nLife is often challenging. We feel down and want to feel better.\nWe seek solutions and try to identify what needs to change. We yearn for a quick fix, and it's easy to blame work. Considering it occupies around a third of our daily lives, it's not surprising that we hold our jobs accountable.\n\"Yes, of course, it's my workplace. There we have it. I gotta quit!\"\nBut is that really the root of the problem?\nIt might be partially, or not at all. Regardless, it's never wise to make major decisions based on fleeting, fluctuating, and undefined emotions.\nThere's usually no rush. It's worth waiting a while.
