          "description": "Unavoidable evidence of the catastrophic consequences of climate change confronts us at every turn. Record high ocean temperatures. Once-a-century storms that appear every other year. And on and on. In the face of ongoing ecological disaster, international best-selling author Kōhei Saitō asks why our society continues to prioritize corporate profits (and the rapacious expansion on which they depend), and proposes a revolutionary alternative to unfettered capitalism: degrowth communism.\nIn Slow Down, Saitō provocatively argues that any solutions that don’t directly confront capitalism itself—from the COP agreements to the “Green New Deal”—represent dangerous compromises that may ultimately worsen the climate emergency. Because it creates artificial scarcity and endlessly produces commodities based on their value, rather than their usefulness, our economic system itself makes it impossible to reverse climate change so long as capitalism remains in place. The biggest contributor to the problem cannot be an integral part of its solution.\nInstead, Saitō advocates for degrowth and deceleration, which he conceives as the slowing of economic activity through the democratic reform of labor and our system of production. By returning to a system of social ownership, degrowth communism, we can restore the abundance of things that we truly need, and can focus on those activities that are essential for human life.\nWhat would this alternative look like? How do we end mass production and mass consumption without reducing living standards? What do we need to do to redress global inequality without accelerating the rate at which the planet burns?\nFor this launch event Saitō will be in conversation on all of this, and more, with Science for the People editor, and Pilsen Community Books collective member and CounterPunch Radio co-host Erik Wallenberg. This event occurred on May 24, 2024 at Haymarket House in Chicago. More\nThe post Degrowth Communism: Kōhei Saitō appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?",

          "description": "I'm conflicted.\nIt's absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models \"boring\".\nThe reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I'll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.\nShe can't tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.\nYou can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn't know how to get back.\nYou could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn't notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn't know they even exist.\nAll the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.\nYou might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she's highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It's not that she's unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn't care.\nIt's becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.\nI think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don't buy the pro and they're desperate for selling points in the regular model.\nIf the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.",

This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.\" I would not have used it.\nBut Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.\nDo you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it's own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn't even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.\nSo thanks for all your work making the world a better place.",

The technology is good enough to achieve flaw levels in the parts per billion range, and to make diamond windows for lasers 10cm across.[1]\nThis is way above jewelry grade.\nOver on the natural diamond side, there's been a breakthrough. The industry used to break up some large diamonds during rock crushing. Now there's a industrial X-ray system which is used to examine rocks before crushing to find diamonds. It's working quite well. A 2500 carat diamond was found recently.[1][2] TOMRA, which makes high-volume sorters for everything from recyclables to rice, has a sorter for this job. This is working so well that there's now something of a glut of giant diamonds too big for jewelry.\nThe finishing processes of cutting and polishing have been automated. The machinery for that comes mostly from China and India.\nDiamonds are now something you can buy by the kilo, in plastic bags.\n[1] https://e6-prd-cdn-01.azureedge.net/mediacontainer/medialibr...\n[2] https://www.forbes.com/sites/amandakooser/2024/08/23/monster...\n[3] https://ikcabstracts.com/index.php/ikc/article/download/4101...",

          "description": "There are a number of concrete problems:\n- syscall interfaces are a mess, the primitive APIs are too slow for regular sized packets (~1500 bytes), the overhead is too high. GSO helps but it’s a horrible API, and it’s been buggy even lately due to complexity and poor code standards.\n- the syscall costs got even higher with spectre mitigation - and this story likely isn’t over. We need a replacement for the BSD sockets / POSIX APIs they’re terrible this decade. Yes, uring is fancy, but there’s a tutorial level API middle ground possible that should be safe and 10x less overhead without resorting to uring level complexity.\n- system udp buffers are far too small by default - they’re much much smaller than their tcp siblings, essentially no one but experts have been using them, and experts just retune stuff.\n- udp stack optimizations are possible (such as possible route lookup reuse without connect(2)), gso demonstrates this, though as noted above gso is highly fallible, quite expensive itself, and the design is wholly unnecessarily intricate for what we need, particularly as we want to do this safely from unprivileged userspace.\n- several optimizations currently available only work at low/mid-scale, such as connect binding to (potentially) avoid route lookups / GSO only being applicable on a socket without high peer-competition (competing peers result in short offload chains due to single-peer constraints, eroding the overhead wins).\nDespite all this, you can implement GSO and get substantial performance improvements, we (tailscale) have on Linux. There will be a need at some point for platforms to increase platform side buffer sizes for lower end systems, high load/concurrency, bdp and so on, but buffers and congestion control are a high complex and sometimes quite sensitive topic - nonetheless, when you have many applications doing this (presumed future state), there will be a need.",

If I were to second guess the people behind most of the comments, I would assume no one has ever run a business with payroll, or built something with this much reach. The comments ring really hollow for the most part and seem really callous given this person has sunk his life into making the world, and my life, a better place.

          "description": "Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30's) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.\nI just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other's people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn't out to impress anybody, I just became \"Mr. Dependable\" on any of the teams I worked on.\nThis was the approach that changed everything.\nNow, some ten years later? I'm never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that's it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.\nI found out that if you don't protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You'll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.\nProtect yourself. Protect your sanity. Once you lose it, like OP said, it's very, very hard to get back.\nI hope this helps someone else struggling to break this cycle.",

          "description": "If you use clickbait headlines like the one I used for this blog post, you might get a lot of Internet points. You might also get a lot of mockery and derision and not much respect. Where ever I go on the social web, I have to ask myself what my purpose is. There are ways of manipulating lots of different platforms so that the clicker next to your user name goes up. One of the buzz words that gets tossed around on different platforms is engagement. It is usually a quantitative term having to do with the number of likes or followers your \"content\" has. Content is also a buzzword and one I don't like very much. I'm not a content creator. I am a writer. I do the same thing millions of people have done before me. I think up things in my head. I assign words to those things and I record them. M…",

          "description": "Image Gallery for Bear Blog\nThis gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It's also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.\nActually, the gallery add-on itself isn't very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here's the result (instructions below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nThe gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a \"section\") with the class gallery. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nSince the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nFinally, add the following style to your theme:\n/* Gallery */\n.gallery ul  {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-auto-rows: 150px;\n  grid-gap: 12px;\n  padding: 20px 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.gallery li {\n  position: relative;\n  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);\n}\n.gallery img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n\nThere have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.\nI hope you find the gallery useful!",

          "description": "I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.\nFor those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.\nSo back to the update…\nKey Updates\nChanging the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.\nYou will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).\nThere is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.\nA battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.\nThe long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.\nThe counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.\nUpdated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).\nThe response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!\n…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.\nSample photos\nPhotos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.\nIf you're interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they're shipping these new cameras now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naffiliate code.↩",

There were so many options to choose from: the type of sausage, size, how it should be prepared, type of bread, which toppings I wanted…\nFinally, I said, \"I'll have an original.\"\nIt's nice to have freedom of choice and options, but sometimes it feels more like an obstacle than an opportunity. Soon, you'll have to fire up AI to be able to buy milk.\nWhen it comes to my work on the Bearming theme for Bear, it's the exact opposite—and it feels very liberating.\nSince there are limitations to what can be achieved in terms of underlying markup, there aren't many possibilities left when it comes to styling. You have to compromise and think outside the box. Also, since the theme is intended for the general public, you have to try to accomplish everything without getting too technical. It’s challenging, rewarding, and fun at the same time.\nDoes this mean I’d rather live in a world where everyone's got the same boring cereal? No, of course not. I'll take a little FOMO over waiting in line for a Trabant any day.\nI think, however, that it can be useful to consciously limit ourselves somewhat in this world of possibilities. Maybe we don't need five streaming services—at least not at the same time? Maybe it's enough if we limit our social media accounts to one or two?\nA great number of our decisions are not really our own but are suggested to us from the outside; we have succeeded in persuading ourselves that it is we who have made the decision, whereas we have actually conformed with the expectations of others, driven by the fear of isolation and by more direct threats to our life, freedom, and comfort.\nWritten almost a hundred years ago by social psychologist and ”FOMO guru” Erich Fromm.

          "description": "I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.\nI feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.\nI mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.\nThere was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.\nI missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.\nSo here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.\nSide note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?\n53/100\n💬 Community Echoes\nWeek Notes #003 by Martin Schuhmann\nReply by email",

(2016) Are These Bubbles Anarchist? Peter Sloterdijk’s Spherology and the Question of Anarchism. Anarchist Studies, 24 (1).\nSource: wrap.warwick.ac.uk\n\nAbstract\n The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…",

It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. \n The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently 'anarchist.' 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to 'anarchist' batt…",

These phones can be purchased anonymously — in person, in cash, with a covid mask and hat, and with a car parked far away — meaning only surveillance footage of the purchase is available once you walk out of the store. Yet, after purchasing these devices, we often bring them to houses, apartments, squats, camps, and hideouts. Cellular phones can be tracked using GPS or triangulation information from the cellular network provider, to determine your identity after purchase.
