For Freire, education and literacy were revolutionary tools for developing an anti-capitalist consciousness.  However, as Freire’s work traveled from Brazil to Latin America, Africa, and the hybrid cultural borderlands of North America, it was and has often been appropriated in ways that dilute its radical essence.

Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.\nHere, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.\nIn this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.\nOriginal decision here, pages 3-4 has the relevant facts: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25423841/no-disassemb...",

          "description": "US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from \"ordinary expenses\" as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people's intuition of what \"living paycheck-to-paycheck\" means. That isn't nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.\nThere is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; \"ordinary\" is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as \"ordinary\". By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.\nBy contrast, the median US household has >$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as \"ordinary\" and therefore not saving it. The categories of \"non-ordinary\" expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.\nThe implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.\nAmericans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.",
