They were on a crucial UN mission to the newly independent Congo, where Hammarskjöld was to meet Moïse Tshombe, leader of secessionist Katanga province who was lavishly backed by Western political and mining interests, and negotiate the withdrawal of Belgian troops and deployment of UN peacekeepers. A large amount of circumstantial evidence screams murder, but the UN isn’t screaming at all, even though eleven of its staff, plus five Swedish crew members of DC6 flight SE-BDY were killed. Most speculation about what happened that night tends to focus on events in Congo, who killed Hammarskjöld, and why.

On Bear, I have regularly shared light, easily digestible reads, like slices of life and productivity takes. But I have also shared the brutal reality of living with mental health struggles.\nI created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist's advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.\nI won't lie to you, though, t…",

          "description": "I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.\nThere came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.\nI continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.\nWhile I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.\nI’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.\nReply via email",

          "description": "I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).\nAnd then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.\nEver since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.\nYesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.\nAlthough I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.\nIt was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.\nAnd if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.\n55/100\nReply by email",

It's also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.\nActually, the gallery add-on itself isn't very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here's the result (instructions below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nThe gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a \"section\") with the class gallery. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nSince the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n\n* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)\n* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)\n* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nFinally, add the following style to your theme:\n/* Gallery */\n.gallery ul  {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-auto-rows: 150px;\n  grid-gap: 12px;\n  padding: 20px 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.gallery li {\n  position: relative;\n  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);\n}\n.gallery img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n\nThere have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.\nI hope you find the gallery useful!",

          "description": "I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.\nFor those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.\nSo back to the update…\nKey Updates\nChanging the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.\nYou will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).\nThere is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.\nA battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.\nThe long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.\nThe counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.\nUpdated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).\nThe response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!\n…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.\nSample photos\nPhotos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.\nIf you're interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they're shipping these new cameras now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naffiliate code.↩",

In a sense, I felt like a pariah compared to my peers, and I was curious how depression manifests in others compared to me, because, despite living with this condition for years, I was clueless about what it was.\nPeople tend to think that the most telltale sign of depression is sadness, but I discovered depression manifests overwhelmingly different across individuals: those who experience the crushing sadness, those with the intense mood swings, or those with detachment from their lives.

Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized.

It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. \n The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently 'anarchist.' 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to 'anarchist' batt…",

These phones can be purchased anonymously — in person, in cash, with a covid mask and hat, and with a car parked far away — meaning only surveillance footage of the purchase is available once you walk out of the store. Yet, after purchasing these devices, we often bring them to houses, apartments, squats, camps, and hideouts. Cellular phones can be tracked using GPS or triangulation information from the cellular network provider, to determine your identity after purchase. Here we discuss a method to minimize the risk of unintentionall…",
