          "description": "Image by Heather Mount.\nBetween armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.\nProfitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Gun Violence and the Marketing of Militarism appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!\nWithout exploring, crafting and building, you can't survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.\nAnd people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.\nPulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn't just lucky. He mastered programming and game design and created a novel experience.",

Why? because either a company before tried to monopolise the entire country, or they killed someone.\nNow, large tech companies haven't wholesale killed people (unlike say tobacco, or talc powder, 3M and half of their solvents, weed killer, most car makers, etc etc)\nbut they have been trying desperately to stop all competition.\nThey've also been trying to extract as much personal info as possible for profit. Because regulators in the USA are hamstrung, they are used to being able to basically doing stuff that would be illegal if it were in physical stores/pre-existing industries.",

The reason not every company does it to all its employees is probably that for those employees, it wouldn't affect incentives much and it would make payment subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day.\nIf the story is \"it should be the law that every company offers stock options\", then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above.\nIf the story is \"all companies must be fully employee-owned workers' cooperatives\", then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers' rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can't sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There's a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won't sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers' stake.",

Stripping types is not a token-level operation, and the TypeScript grammar is changing all the time.\nConsider for example: `foo  ( x )`. In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo (x)) because bar&baz wasn’t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I’m going back in time here but it’s a nice simple example.\nIf you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date.

Then the supervisor came over, told me that I \"was required to have to have my photo taken\" and opting out consisted of checking a box in the software to not save my photo. My alternative was to not get on the flight.\nThe whole idea of opting out is a scam. They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public.",

As a recap:\ntensor is an umbrella term for \"mathematical objects\" or \"containers\" that have a rank/dimensionality associated with them.\nScalars are rank-0 tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors and so on.\nOne important property of a tensor is its shape.

It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

It's a thoughtful place for me, but it's also felt like a sort of put-on place, like I'm playing a specific version of myself, or like my site has developed a brand or style, which I've already mentioned not liking. So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let's get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I'll be switching to Bear's \"Plain HTML\" theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I'm not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!",

One email started with \"Dude, that's my life too.\" The sender described being incredibly invested in a project one week and wanting to abandon it entirely the next.\nI've been on the brink of shutting down this blog multiple times, as recently as yesterday. It's hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.\nIt's living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator. I'm constantly considering pulling the plug. It's like a dragonfly that's been granted several extra lives, but now feels like its luck is running out. It's sneaking around like a cat aware that its nine lives are nearly spent.\nIt might sound bleak, but it's my reality. I doubt it will ever change. Yet, there's beauty in it too:\nI'm not alone.\nIt becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.\nWe're not alone.\nBlogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community.
