          "description": "Image by Evgeniy Smersh.\nAny rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.\nhere or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post A Punk Rock Paean appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

This enhancement\nhelps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between\ndifferent phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.\nFor a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a\n.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of\nwhen the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume\nis updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.\nWhat changed?\nThe API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the\ncurrent timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will\nbe overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.\nFor more details, read about\nPhase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

          "description": "I came to this same conclusion some years ago while working on a side project.\nBefore anything LLM existed, I built a site[0] to generate fake \"AWS Blog Posts.\"  I trained a markov chain generator on all AWS announcement posts up to that point, copied the html + css of aws's standard blog posts, then glued them all together with some python + JS.  It turned out, IMO, pretty funny!  People familiar with AWS's blog posts would often get several sentences in before they realized they were looking at word-soup.\nWhen GPT was new, I looked into using that to \"upgrade\" it.  I spent a weekend messing around with Minimaxir's gpt-2-simple generating blog posts based on AWS content.  What I found was, ultimately, it was way less fun.  The posts were far too realistic to be interesting.  They read like totally-real blog posts that just happened to not be true.\nI realized then that the humor of those early markov generations was the ridiculousness.  The point where, a few words or sentences in, you realized it was all nonsense.  LLM's these days are too good for that - the text they generate is sometimes wrong, but rarely nonsense in a humorous way.\nMarkov chain content was wrong in a \"kid's say the darndest things\" way, while modern LLMs are wrong in a \"My uncle doesn't know basic geography\" way.\n[0] https://totes-not-amazon.com/ - click any link to get a new one.",

As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.\nWow. I've never though about this before, but this is an awful second-order consequence of the high app store fees set by Apple and Google. It essentially incentivizes App makers to treat users as products not customers!\n(Not too surprising for Google, but certainly goes against Apple's public stance).",

If the ruling had capped it to 14 or 30 days, that would be a useful ruling.\nA hard time cap is essential because one's life too has a cap. The amount of time for which one can go without earning a livelihood also has a cap. Imagine if prison sentences didn't have a time cap.\nThis illustrates a common problem with our laws.

But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it's quite expensive, \"contact us\" salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor.\nThe Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there's was a way to walk back from it. But now there's no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition.\nI think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes?\nI wish them the best, they're a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause.\nGetting in bed with a single vendor for an incredibly sticky tool comes with a _lot_ of risk.

Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you're watching right now.\nAnother thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called \"SoundFixer\" that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it's super distracting), but it doesn't seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they're embedded. I don't know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It's probably too niche and hard to do though.\nAlso I don't seem to find any volume control except mute?",

The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs.\nCourts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics.

However, I’d be remiss not to acknowledge it’s actual origin1 as described by mocha beanie mummy.\nSometimes I find that words can clutter a photograph. Sometimes I want to look at a photograph, and make up my own mind about it, what I think about it, rather than what others might think it should be about.\nThe rules guidelines are simple:2\nOnly one photo.\nThe photo you post must be taken by you.\nPhoto must be taken the week you post it.\nNo other words in the post. Title can be: Silent Sunday or date, nothing else.\nOf course, like everything out there, people have done their own Silent Sunday renditions. However, from what I see in the Mastodon hashtag, people are mostly keeping to its original concept.\n\n18/31 - Blaugust\nReply by email\nMany thanks to R Scott Jones for pointing me in the right direction.↩\n\n\nwording taken from the site but paraphrased.↩",

If you consistently feel like \"this is the wrong place for me,\" I strongly believe you should quit as soon as possible. I've personally quit jobs within the first week.\nGiven that work occupies a significant portion of our lives, it's crucial that it feels right. But the very fact that work constitutes a large part of our lives can also mislead us.\nBesides work, we have relationships, hobbies, financial responsibilities, and our health to maintain. And, as we all know, life isn't always a constant joyride. Relationships can strain, health can deteriorate, and unexpected financial problems can arise.\nLife is often challenging. We feel down and want to feel better.\nWe seek solutions and try to identify what needs to change. We yearn for a quick fix, and it's easy to blame work. Considering it occupies around a third of our daily lives, it's not surprising that we hold our jobs accountable.\n\"Yes, of course, it's my workplace. There we have it. I gotta quit!\"\nBut is that really the root of the problem?\nIt might be partially, or not at all. Regardless, it's never wise to make major decisions based on fleeting, fluctuating, and undefined emotions.\nThere's usually no rush. It's worth waiting a while. The most important thing is that it's the right decision, whenever and whatever we decide.\nYou can't eliminate ripples on water with a slap. Wait, and they will eventually subside. Against this still background, the correct answer will emerge.",

So it feels all the more terrible when I'm suddenly hit with a wave of depression.\nFor me, these waves come and go at random intervals. I could be having the best day and be hit with the most intense bouts of sadness, anxiety, and hopelessness. It might not be the most healthy thing to do, but I try to distract myself from these feelings by immersing myself in my work, hobbies, or playing video games with friends. This doesn't always help, but it does keep my mind off of it, at least for a short time.\nIt does get overwhelming sometimes dealing with all this by myself. I don't really have anyone in my life to speak about these things, so I have elected to scream these thoughts into the void that is my blog. I rarely, if at all, feel comfortable enough to talk about my feelings with friends or family because I was raised in a culture where that was not common or tolerated.\nThis might all sound hopeless, but I know that this will soon pass and that these feelings are temporary. All I have to do is ride out the waves.\n17/31",

Right after, I decided that I am definitely feeling sick.\nHowever, I had an important meeting at 8:00am. I told my team I wasn't feeling well and that after that discussion (1.5hrs later), I was logging off for the day.\nI spent Thursday on the couch, resting, and watching TV… and trying not to feel guilty about calling out of work.\nToday (Friday) comes around. I told myself I would gauge how I felt when I woke up. Once again, today is filled with important meetings, and meetings to prepare for more important meetings on Monday.\nI called out. Now, I am going to spend Friday doing similar things as yesterday. Resting, watching tv, and trying not to feel guilty about calling out of work.\nMy co-worker texted me yesterday when she saw that I had called out sick.\n\"You are worth so much more than just work.\"\nI think it’s an important reminder to me, and to anyone else that struggles with the guilt every time they have to call out of work.

It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.\nSounds wonderful!\nFor me, it’s the opposite. When I write on my phone, I stop and “overthink” things. I lose the flow I crave, just letting the thoughts flow onto the page. That’s why I can’t write in English either. It becomes awkwardly stilted.\nI've tried a bunch of different ways to write, and I've figured out that writing in Swedish first is the way to go for me. I usually type it up on my computer, using TextEdit in full-screen, and then translate it. After that, I go through the text and edit some parts here and there.\nIt might sound like a lot of extra work, but I've actually grown to enjoy the process. It’s fun, interesting, and I'm learning a ton.\nWhether we choose to write on a computer, phone, or in a notebook doesn’t matter. The important thing is that we find a setup that suits us. Besides, as Cole mentions, one doesn’t exclude the other.\nChanging your method for a period can work wonders if writer’s block comes knocking.\nKeep writing!",

It was a small crew, just three of us and our boss. Our boss was, for the most part, pretty cool. He didn’t work us to the bone. He was flexible about time off. He was down to call me Magpie. He paid us under the table. Sometimes he’d cancel work to go surfing.
