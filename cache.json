I traveled there for the New York alternative publication The Village Voice to investigate Israel’s growing settler movement, Gush Emunim (or the Bloc of the Faithful). The English-language Israeli newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, then reported that settlers from Kiryat Arba, a Jewish West Bank outpost, had murdered two Palestinian teenagers from the village of Halhoul. There, in one of the earliest West Bank settlements established by Gush Emunim, a distant cousin of my husband had two acquaintances. Under cover of being a Jew in search of enlightenment, I spent several days and nights with them. More\nThe post A Cancer on the West Bank appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.",

          "description": "The consumer price index for groceries has risen more than the overall price index since the start of the pandemic, with a particularly large jump in 2022. In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.",

          "description": "Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.",

I have many friends (in Europe) who are trying to get through to different jobs in unrelated industries ranging from finance to fashion, or just trying to get promoted vertically (or horizontally), failing rather miserably.\nMost jobs are now hoops after hoops, not taking into consideration your particular profile or the contributions you can make. Keep in mind also that a CV in the pile via a job portal is always going to be sediment at the bottom of the barrel. Try to make use of your networks and friends as much as possible.\nAs for my situation, I too feel a bit burned by the diminishing number of tech jobs, as I was in the process of trying to get a job via a software consultancy firm, but remained benched for 8 months. I dropped it, went back to doing corporate and tax valuations. Being underemployed is, thus far, better than nothing at all, especially mentally.\nP.S. Here's a nice little tidbit in the source:\n  \n\nI have to admit, I did slip up on this banana by being a lazy monkey.",

Based on my experience as a tech entrepreneur with edu-focused products across multiple startups and decades, scaling sales revenue to significant levels in edu is extremely challenging for unique and non-obvious reasons. None of the edu-specific challenges are directly related to the effectiveness or relative value of the product itself. They are structural problems related to the three main types of buyers, which are: 1. Schools, (K-12, Univ), 2. Companies (employee training, compliance, etc), 3. Individuals (self-learners).

In terms of having utility of estimating how long something will take, I personally have never been able to translate story points into a reliable indicator for that for many reasons (e.g team changing, domain changing, variability in operational load outside of development work).\nOverall I tend to avoid using story points, but on the few teams I worked on who really wanted to use it, I always framed it around building shared understanding rather than a metric that is actually useful for estimating work.",

Having a virtual Feynman coach you through a Physics course is perfect.\nMost learners, the world over, are not self-motivated. The pandemic showed us exactly what children would prefer to do, when they don't have a physical teacher standing over them, which is bugger all. We send kids to school, in the hope they get some education, but the reality is that we use schools for free childcare while we work. If parents have to additionally monitor their child's learning, it breaks down pretty quickly.\nI see AI being more of a teaching assistant, rather than a replacement for teachers. Having been in the education game for over twenty five years, I know the difference in impact when comparing virtual learning to in-person training.",

They're afraid that one day Rust will become a \"monoculture\" and everything will be written in it.\nI like Rust, but I consider this very, very unlikely.\nRust has actually brought more choice to the programming language scenario. If we're talking about monoculture, let's talk about C/C++. For decades this was the only viable option for systems programming. All new languages were focusing on a higher lever. Languages for lower level stuff were rare. There was D, but it never got enough traction.\nThen Rust appeared and there is finally an alternative. And not only that, I because of that, other language designers decided to create new systems languages, and now we have Zig, and Odin, and Vale, etc.\nSo if anything, Rust is helping in breaking the monoculture, not creating it. C and C++ are not going away, but now we have alternatives.\nAnd I think it's important to acknowledge that even if you don't like a language, if you see a bunch of software being written in such language, it's because the language is useful. I don't like C++ but I admit it's damn useful! People are writing interesting software in Rust because they find it useful.",

His comment surprised me, and, in a sense, demonstrated to me that saying a polygraph is \"fake\" is akin to saying WWE wrestling is \"fake\". Of course it is, but that is a misunderstanding that what you're watching is a real performance.\nHe said the polygraph itself is just a tool for the interviewer. The real value was in someone who knew how to use the machine to convince the subject that they knew the truth. He continue that in his time he knew some mighty good interviewers who could easily extract anything they needed from you.\nMy father did go the clearance route, and when I asked him about the polygraph he told me he confessed things to the interviewers he would never have told my mother. \"Fake\" or \"real\" the polygraph does work in this sense.",

We already sell customer drug-prescription data to drug companies, and the drug companies analyze this data to understand where/when/why/to-whom their drugs are being prescribed. Now we're going to help the drug companies advise doctors on where/when/why/to-whom they prescribe drugs.\n- Sounds great.

Never use the term \"kickback\".\nAnd that was pretty much it. The company processed prescriptions for pharmacies, then sold that data to drug companies, who in turn used that data to provide kickbacks to doctors for pushing their drugs over a competitor.

          "description": "The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn't miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.\nPerhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn't a failure, it's essential, especially for problems in systems you've never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn't signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.",

          "description": "Until the US federal government pays civilian tech talent competitively, this is always going to be an issue.\nYour typical hands-on-keyboard blue team engineer in federal government is a GS-12 getting paid around $68,000 per year (or $99k in very high cost of living areas like DC). They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.\nThe best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.\nAs a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.\nIf there's one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They've done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.",

Companies are going to do the bare minimum when it comes to securing data as long as breaches have almost no real consequences.

          "description": "Contrary to what the name may suggest, this is not a blog dedicated solely to my problems. As I make my debut into the realm of Bear — thrilled at the thought of reaching other bloggers through the ever-inspiring discovery feed — I must make one thing clear: I love a good rhyme. Sometimes more than logic. And in this case, the tradeoff for choosing a name that rhymes is that the content in my blog won’t always align with the title, and I’m okay with that.\nMy purpose here isn’t to please or to delight; it’s to express — something we rarely get the space to do authentically online. Being here takes a degree of vulnerability for me, but it comes with the gentle comfort of some anonymity.\nHere, I am still Emma as I am in everyday life, but I am also imperceptible behind the words you read. While I plan to share with an open heart and freely exhibit the more anomalous corners of my mind, I know that the stakes are lower than what they seem to be on other platforms, where it often feels like I'm being observed too closely, or slipping into an alter-ego that doesn't truly capture me. Here, it feels like I can say what I want to say without the recurring fear of being perceived or held to a fixed identity. And, no matter who happens to stumble upon the musings of these pages — no matter who thinks what of the words I write — I still intend to make this a space where I can comfortably express whatever may come to the surface of my being.\nAnd so, with a nod of thanks to you, the equally imperceptible reader, and also one to the creator of this charming platform — who happens to be the man I gladly spend my days with — so begins my emergence. Let’s see what this Bear blogness is all about.",

Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.\nThe bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)\n\nThen I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .\nMy half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.\nMy grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?\nI told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.\nI cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).\nI was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.\nI felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth.

But it feels so incredibly boring to write about.\nI don't know what it is, but lately these things feel completely pointless to write about. I'm a tech geek, so it's natural for these ideas to come up, but writing serves a different purpose. At least for me.\nAm I saying that writing about technology is \"bad\"? No, of course not. I read blogs like MacRumors and 9to5Google every day with great interest (I used to run similar blogs myself). But that's not what I want to write about, at least not right now.\nNow I like writing mainly for the therapeutic, almost meditative effect it has on me. I write every day, and I find it very rewarding on a personal level.\nThese thoughts also lead me to a topic I've been writing about several times now: my ambivalence toward writing in English. I'm writing this text in Swedish because it's too hard and time-consuming to do it in English (I've tried many times) and then using DeepL to translate it.\nWhy bother with all of that? Well, that's what I'm asking myself.\nIf I'm writing mainly for personal gain, why not just in Swedish? The only thing I can think of is because of the increased attention, which honestly feels like an idiotic argument.\nOk, this was not a text I had planned. Maybe I shouldn't even post it, but that doesn't matter.\nThese are my thoughts here and now, unedited.",

          "description": "This post is inspired by Misha’s post a life lived diligently.\nI started playing the piano when I was five. My first dream was to be a concert pianist like Lang Lang. I was drawn to the glitz and glamor of playing in cavernous concert halls to people in suits sitting on red velvet chairs. I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.\nFor a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around. I thought it a nice compromise between my childhood fantasies and reality.\nMom pulled the plug on my private lessons when I was seventeen, after …",
