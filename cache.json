          "description": "Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.",

          "description": "The consumer price index for groceries has risen more than the overall price index since the start of the pandemic, with a particularly large jump in 2022. In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.",

We're expected to look like teenagers for the rest of our lives, and it's exhausting.\n-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don't read them. I'm a collector of nightstand-books.\n-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I'm in love.\n-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.\n-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you're shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you're wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it's like I'm afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.\n-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).\n-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don't know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.",

          "description": "Contrary to what the name may suggest, this is not a blog dedicated solely to my problems. As I make my debut into the realm of Bear — thrilled at the thought of reaching other bloggers through the ever-inspiring discovery feed — I must make one thing clear: I love a good rhyme. Sometimes more than logic. And in this case, the tradeoff for choosing a name that rhymes is that the content in my blog won’t always align with the title, and I’m okay with that.\nMy purpose here isn’t to please or to delight; it’s to express — something we rarely get the space to do authentically online. Being here takes a degree of vulnerability for me, but it comes with the gentle comfort of some anonymity.\nHere, I am still Emma as I am in everyday life, but I am also imperceptible behind the words you read. While I plan to share with an open heart and freely exhibit the more anomalous corners of my mind, I know that the stakes are lower than what they seem to be on other platforms, where it often feels like I'm being observed too closely, or slipping into an alter-ego that doesn't truly capture me. Here, it feels like I can say what I want to say without the recurring fear of being perceived or held to a fixed identity. And, no matter who happens to stumble upon the musings of these pages — no matter who thinks what of the words I write — I still intend to make this a space where I can comfortably express whatever may come to the surface of my being.\nAnd so, with a nod of thanks to you, the equally imperceptible reader, and also one to the creator of this charming platform — who happens to be the man I gladly spend my days with — so begins my emergence. Let’s see what this Bear blogness is all about.",

I always take a shower & change cloths.\nI was half sleep ironing my pant & shirt while yawning . Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.\nThe bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)\n\nThen I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .\nMy half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.\nMy grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?\nI told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.\nI cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).\nI was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.\nI felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth.

But it feels so incredibly boring to write about.\nI don't know what it is, but lately these things feel completely pointless to write about. I'm a tech geek, so it's natural for these ideas to come up, but writing serves a different purpose. At least for me.\nAm I saying that writing about technology is \"bad\"? No, of course not. I read blogs like MacRumors and 9to5Google every day with great interest (I used to run similar blogs myself). But that's not what I want to write about, at least not right now.\nNow I like writing mainly for the therapeutic, almost meditative effect it has on me. I write every day, and I find it very rewarding on a personal level.\nThese thoughts also lead me to a topic I've been writing about several times now: my ambivalence toward writing in English. I'm writing this text in Swedish because it's too hard and time-consuming to do it in English (I've tried many times) and then using DeepL to translate it.\nWhy bother with all of that? Well, that's what I'm asking myself.\nIf I'm writing mainly for personal gain, why not just in Swedish? The only thing I can think of is because of the increased attention, which honestly feels like an idiotic argument.\nOk, this was not a text I had planned. Maybe I shouldn't even post it, but that doesn't matter.\nThese are my thoughts here and now, unedited.",

I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.\nFor a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around.

(but i knew that that would be particularly difficult to do on such a tight schedule).\nhonestly, before my trip, i was 100% convinced i’d hate being on the ocean for such long stretches of time. and this is still partially true now that it's over. i’m prone to motion sickness and i’m afraid of a slow death. i ended up partially bedridden for three days, so i was right to worry about the former. i couldn’t eat anything but apples, and i threw up everytime i moved from my bed. it sucked, but at least i'm not dead.\nwhen i recovered, i discovered that it was ironically grounding to stroll the topmost deck and see nothing but blue and horizon. and that it was especially beautiful at night, even if you couldn't really see the stars at all. instead, i’d watch the water long enough for it to look like a fingerprint. then, even longer to find the unicorns in the sea foam. i found myself returning to the same thought each time: in the grand scheme of all things, i am fortunately very small. i will never run out of earth to explore. nothing is never really just nothing, but nothing feels as good as finally being home too.",

I just don't want to be a part of that anymore.\nthere is also another reason I'm doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.\n\nhow I manage it\nI download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn't get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.\nI use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.\nnotes\nyou can also take a look at kit's post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.\nreply via email\nliked this post? you can follow my rss feed for more. i'd also appreciate if you toasted this post below.  🍞",

At time of posting, that heatwave is continuing east across North America, and more will certainly follow in the coming months and years as the climate crisis worsens. While this zine contains a couple sentences specific to so-called Boulder Colorado, it should still be broadly applicable, and we encourage people to print and distribute it anywhere that’s affected by extreme heat. We note that the advice contained within is not particularly useful without the supplies needed to follow it, and we recommend accompanying this zine with water, electrolyte powder…",

They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians. At the time, the Commune controlled Paris, which was st…",
