          "description": "Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are growing, but banks support that growth via funding and liquidity insurance. The transformation of activities and risks from banks to a bank-NBFI nexus may have benefits in normal states of the world, as it may result in overall growth in (especially, credit) markets and widen access to a wide range of financial services, but the system may be disproportionately exposed to financial and economic instability when aggregate tail risk materializes. In this post, we consider the systemic implications of the observed build-up of bank-NBFI connections associated with the growth of NBFIs.",

In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.",

          "description": "It absolutely melts my mind every time I come across the two facts that:\n- People experience their thoughts very differently\n- We all secretly believe that deep down, everyone experiences thought like we do.\nI've never really had a strong internal monologue when thinking, so my assumption would always be that of course, thinking isn't very linguistic (even if we can use it as a tool while thinking).\nIt seems like there's a large number of people who experience their thought exclusively as language.\nThat sounds absolutely nuts to me, but I've heard people say the exact same in reverse. Even more fringe is that there's a sizable number of people who when thinking about words (i.e. remembering names) visualize their words as text. What!? I can't imagine that anymore than I can imagine how a jellyfish feels?\nThe University of Wisconsin did a cool study that comes with a fun quiz you can do to see just how much of a wierdo you truly are: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3NMm9yyFsNio...",

How is that acceptable?\nI install Edge Beta to test something, and the I uninstall it. All of the sudden my search provider in my normal Edge is reset.\nAnd the nagging everywhere. No I don't want 'back-up' my files (OneDrive is not backup, it's sync). And I don't want to be reminded later. I don't want to be reminded ever. All this fuzzy language makes me feel like I'm dealing with a kindergarden teacher addressing his/her pupils.\nIt's not my computer any more.\nOh, I update a driver. And 2 days later Windows installs an older version. Since when is 6.6.1.40 better than 6.6.1.72? Why would you do that?",

And they blew it! Further, they had the means to feed everyone, clothe everyone, house everyone, but they just walked away in the other direction, purely to maintain existing economic power structures.\" The future historians are going to wonder how strong our ideology was that we sacrificed all of what we could have at the altar of our scarcity-based religion.\nIf Star Trek Replicators were invented today, we're so stupid we'd outlaw them.",

          "description": "There is no greater folly of contemporary human society than the purposeful restriction of such vast and easily shareable repositories of knowledge. Perhaps these schemes made sense in the past but with the advent of the internet and independent groups willing to fund all hosting fees, we should move to models of publishing that do not require this restriction of information. Library genesis exists but necessarily must hide and create some friction in the discovery process. A legally unencumbered free library of all books for all people would be the greatest achievement in all of human history. We prevent this achievement due to our attachment to a specific economic system that serves as the current means of financially supporting authors. We must build alternatives to for-profit publishing, and the only resilient and widely acceptable system I can imagine is one where every community owns and controls the means of production upon which they depend for their survival. In such an economic system, the need for automation would be obvious and once implemented, all people would receive the benefits of automation. This would include such a wide allowance for leisure and free time that authors would no longer need to restrict access to their books to extract profits from their value their shared knowledge creates. All people would be free to do what they will.\nIt would take great effort to build such a system, but open source and digital repositories of machine designs would ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The effort would still be substantial, but what hangs in the balance is the opportunity to assure the freedom of all people and the creation of the most significant repository of knowledge humanity has ever conceived of. If we succeed it will be our greatest achievement as a species.",

          "description": "(ARC Prize co-founder here).\nRyan's work is legitimately interesting and novel \"LLM reasoning\" research! The core idea:\n> get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s)\nRoughly, he's implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we'd love to see more of.\nA couple important notes:\n1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).\n2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn't been validated or scrutinized yet.\nAll said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We'll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\nEDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this",

I can only assume the ultimate cause is the individual motivations of executives and managers. \"Oooo, if we raise subscriptions $10/mo, we'll make lots of money, and it'll look really good on my annual review.\" \"Oooo, this cancellation fee will really help our retention, which will look really good on my annual review.\" \"Making Photoshop subscription only will do amazing things for our revenue.\"\nWhen you have complete market dominance, you have little opportunity for growth. If your employees and investors have an insatiable need for growth, you have to try anyway, and that's where things fall apart. The #1 threat to your magical money faucet is something replacing your product as the photo editor of choice, and you should be 100% focused on making sure that doesn't happen. To do that, you need to be focused on keeping up quality, periodically adding the latest features, and making absolutely sure that the next generation of artists is coming up using your tool.\nThat Adobe rep 25 years ago was 100% correct, but \"I keep the money pipe flowing and did not actively make it worse\" does not get you a promotion.",

          "description": "I remember doing laser cooling of rubidium atoms in physics class. It's really cool how it works:\n* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.\n* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn't affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.\nRubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.",

It meant people learnt their software at home and then insisted on using it at work, where it would be a paid for license.\nIt seems their attitudes changed soon after, perhaps due to their almost total market dominance, and they became aggressive towards their users in the pursuit of profits. The last Adobe software I really used was Lightroom as that was one of the last pay-once software titles. Now the only Adobe product most of us at work have is except Acrobat Reader.

He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I've learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.\nThe war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I've read not because of it's writing but because if it's relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.\nBrandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It's such a perfect series. Then there's the Stormlight Archive and it's huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).\nHaikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It's about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.\nIt just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it's all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.\nNaval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you've been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He's everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.",

It's also super simple to use.\nFrom a collection standpoint, you just need to insert a call to a javascript script (like many analytics options) and the rest is (mostly) taken care of for you. There is one feature of both BearBlog analytics and Tinylytics that I wanted to be able to replicate in Umami and that's upvoting (called kudos in Tinylytics).

I was looking at the wall clock 45 minutes into my exam (that's what I do in exam halls). This particular time, it brought back memories of my childhood (like in 5th or 6th grade) when I used to play Monopoly with my friends during power cuts.\nAnother memory that recently surfaced depicted my school at 3:30 PM when classes would be over, and there would be clamoring in the corridor until we went to the parking lot. This was triggered by people chatting in front of the exam halls. There is a certain comfort in these noises.\nSavor these moments when they happen, but don't be jailed by them. Remember, time is a cruel mistress who will make you forget the struggles and just remember the good parts.\nIt's like what Andy says in The Office: \"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.\"",

          "description": "“You look tired today.”\nIt wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.\nFor the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.\nWe live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.\nAnd so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.\nYou see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.\nBe kind. Be gentle.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

It is one of those nouns like ‘journey’ and ‘tennis’, which refers not to a thing but to a relationship between things. The statement ‘human society exists’ is simply a less cumbersome way of saying ‘human individuals relate to each other in certain complicated ways’.
