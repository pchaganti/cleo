          "description": "What a lot of people don’t know is that the aid ship Greta was on wasn’t the first ship sent. The last one didn’t get to Israel either, but since there were no major celebrities on it, most people who aren’t 24/7 news or Gaza obsessives don’t know it even existed.\nThis aid ship was never expected to be able to deliver food and medical supplies. Everyone knew Israel would stop it. It was meant to highlight the fact that Israel is has created a deliberate famine in Gaza.\nBecause Greta, in particular, was there, it succeeded. That was her job. She wasn’t required to die, or to wind up in prison, though both were possible, she’s just a lightning rod. I’ve seen at least half a dozen op-eds, most of them negative, about Greta and the relief ship.\nBut negative is fine. Neolibs and right wingers love to hate Greta. They can’t shut up and not talk about her, which is what they should have done. Instead they have to take their potshots, and so far more people know that a ship full of food was hijacked in international waters and that Israel is starving Palestinians to death.\nCelebrities, and Greta is a celebrity, have one main job when it comes to whatever causes they champion: to get press. That’s what Greta did and good for her.\nAs for all the haters, well, Greta’s right that genocide is bad, and she’s right about the environment, so hating her most likely means someone wants mass death, or that they’re stupid and think environmental issues aren’t real.\n***\nIf you’ve read this far, and you read a lot of my articles, you might wish to donate or subscribe. I’ve written over 3,500 posts, and the site, and Ian, take money to run.",

          "description": "The Course of Empire by Thomas Cole\n\nSo, there were protests in L.A. over Trump’s immigrant removal strategy, some turned violent and Trump is calling in the National Guard and talking about using the military.\nIt’s worth pointing out that Trump has deported less undocumented immigrants than Biden did over comparable periods. This isn’t about deportation, as such.\nWhat it is about is Gestapo tactics: sending people to torture prisons without due process; wearing masks and refusing to show badges or warrants; giving ICE the right to create its own warrants without judicial oversight (clearly unconstitutional); seizing people who are showing up for meetings at immigration facilities or immigrant courts.\nIt’s not what Trump is doing, it’s how he’s doing it—in the cruelest, most lawless and un…",

(Maybe that little Pakistan kerfuffle wasn’t cost free?)\nThis is all very amusing and instructive on a number of levels. America banned something that China could handle the bans on: semiconductors.
