We have to pursue policies that are in the U.S. national interest, but we should not be looking to gratuitously put it in China’s face. It will not be to our advantage, or the world’s, to have a Cold War with China similar to the one we had with the Soviet Union.

          "description": "As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.",

          "description": "Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.",

          "description": "While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.",

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins? We conclude with some high-level discussion points on potential regulations of stablecoins.",

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.",

          "description": "I want to put Wifi in the schools. I wanted to know the technical and equipment requirements and the best way to approach it. I am considering 2 approaches.\n1) Standalone for each school\nThis is perhaps the simpler approach, just put a  one strong setup at every school. I would need a splash login page where the student would log in with their student ID and password. The average enrollment at the schools is about 1k, and the area of each school is about a 500 meter radius.\n2) Citywide approach\nWith this one, the major difference is that the students will be able to login at any school in the city, similar to the edu network in the US\nWhat sort of infrastructure would i need for one school with reliable strength? Any recommendations for actual equipment? What is the price estimate/range for one school in the first approach? Are there any companies that already exist that offer this solution including the login stuff as well?\nWhat would be the extra requirements to go from standalone setups to the citywide approach?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39940541\nPoints: 20\n# Comments: 17",

But FAA spokesperson Gregor told SFGATE that the fine was never collected by the agency, which eventually referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for further action. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the fine was ever paid.\nAmazing how a business can just decide to not pay a fine to the FAA, and apparently it's all cool. If I missed $200 on my income taxes, the IRS would be up my ass within a year for it, but apparently the FAA doesn't urgently need that $1M.\nEDIT: It keeps getting better!\n> Turner’s parents filed a wrongful death suit against both Dause and the Parachute Center; three years later, a judge awarded the family a $40 million judgment, writing in the decision that Dause was personally responsible for the payment. Francine Turner told SFGATE the family has never received any payments from Dause or the Parachute Center.\nSo he doesn't have to pay judgments either?

LLM training can be much cheaper than people generally thought.\nThey want you to read this as \"we spent $100k compared to Meta's spending billions\", but that's not actually what this says. It says that they spent $100k and Meta has the resources to spend billions if they wanted to.\nWe don't know what Facebook spent on training LLaMA 2, but they say that it took them 184320 A100-80GB GPU-hours to train the 7B model [0]. AWS charges $14.46/hour for an instance that has 8 of those [1], which amounts to $1.81/GPU/hr.\nAt that rate and assuming they paid something resembling AWS's list price, LLaMA 2 7B cost ~$333k. That's more than $100k, but not by orders of magnitude, and it's likely that Facebook wasn't paying the full price AWS is charging today.\n[0] https://github.com/meta-llama/llama/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md#...\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/",

          "description": "The article posits charging as the problem but that's not actually true.\nThe issue was twofold:\n1. Repair cost and parts availability. Fleet damage was more expensive to repair and took longer. That means more of the fleet is offline at any given time and cost to operate is a bit higher.\n2. Tesla lowered prices forcing them to recognize the depreciation. The cars resale value dropped faster than they anticipated.\nCar and RV rental companies have this problem. People don't want to rent ragged out vehicles. In the case of RVs units for rental are built extra cheap so they don't last anyway. The model is get more in rent then you lose in depreciation then dump the vehicle. In the case of RVs they often turnover the entire fleet yearly.\nThe real killer was no doubt depreciation. That breaks the whole rental car model.",

The Acquired episode does, by the end.\nIt works like this: the ‘luxury’ credit card providers, partnering with Visa, take money away from merchants in order to extract profit for themselves while keeping the credit card consumers happy. The merchants are pissed about this, and regularly make lawsuits to regulate interchange. The money extracted by the credit card companies and Visa causes merchants to raise prices for everyone regardless of whether they have a rewards card or use a credit card at all.\nThis creates in effect a massive money transfer from the poor, who do not use rewards cards, to the rich consumers who do. The Acquired podcast provides specific numbers on just how much worse off poor consumers are given this system, and how much the richest consumers benefit.\nI come from Australia where interchange fee regulation tamps down on the kind of credit card mania and fetishism seen in the USA.",

          "description": "An interesting article, but it doesn't sufficiently emphasize  the lede:  When you use a reward card, the merchant is charged a higher fee than if you used a \"normal\" card.  Simply by putting a different branding on the plastic you pay with, the credit card issuer gets more money from each transaction.\nThe article goes on to ask the question \"Why isn’t every card a rewards card?\", meaning why doesn't every card pay cash back, but I think the more interesting question is why every card isn't branded in a way that makes the issuer more money.  Why do they bother to issue cards where they get paid less?  Why not brand every card as a \"Signature Preferred\" and then pocket the money instead of giving it to the less discerning customers?\nAnd the most interesting question only gets a handwave: \"The basic intuition underlying rewards cards as a product is that highly desirable customers have options in how they spend their money.\"  But how far does this go in explaining why merchants \"choose\" to participate in this program.  The obvious answer would seem to be that they get no benefit from the system as it exists but have no real choice, but maybe there is a better answer?\nI liked the topic, but wished the author could have given more insight on what's happening behind the scenes to produce the outcome we see.",

He noted that this lack of supervision was permitted despite internal checks showing that Lavender’s calculations were considered accurate only 90 percent of the time; in other words, it was known in advance that 10 percent of the human targets slated for assassination were not members of the Hamas military wing at all.```\nSo, there was no human sign-off. I guess the policy itself was ordered by someone, but all the ongoing targets that were selected for assassination were solely authorized by the AI system's predictions.\nThis sentence is horrifically dystopian... \"in order to save time and enable the mass production of human targets without hindrances\"",

          "description": "Years ago, scholars (such as Didier Bigo) have already raised concerns about the targeting of individuals merely based on (indirect) association with a \"terrorist\" or \"criminal\". Originally used in the context of surveillance (see Snowden revelations), such systems would target anyone who would be e.g. less than 3-steps away from an identified individual, thereby removing any sense of due process or targeted surveillance. Now, such AI systems are being used to actually kill people - instead of just surveil.\nIHL actually prohibits the killing of persons who are not combatants or \"fighters\" of an armed group. Only those who have the \"continuous function\" to \"directly participate in hostilities\"[1] may be targeted for attack at any time. Everyone else is a civilian that can only be directly targeted when and for as long as they directly participate in hostilities, such as by taking up arms, planning military operations, laying down mines, etc.\nThat is, only members of the armed wing of Hamas (not recruiters, weapon manufacturers, propagandists, financiers, …) can be targeted for attack - all the others must be arrested and/or tried. Otherwise, the allowed list of targets of civilians gets so wide than in any regular war, pretty much any civilian could get targeted, such as the bank employee whose company has provided loans to the armed forces.\nLavender is so scary because it enables Israel's mass targeting of people who are protected against attack by international law, providing a flimsy (political but not legal) justification for their association with terrorists.\n[1]: https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990...",

It never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more as you get in the subtleties of it.\nAnd you also find there's tremendous trade-offs that you have to make.

You have at least 8-10 years of experience in that domain with some of it in a leadership position (ie product manager)\n2. You already have a huge following or audience. Especially important if this is a SaaS product or b2c. Not as important if this is hard tech (ie biotech).\nBut if you’re doing a HR startup, show me your 10,000 engaged HR followers on LinkedIn. If you’re doing a martech startup, show me your Substack with 10k marketing subscribers.\n3. You already have talked to at least 25 people about this, and gotten feedback about their pain points, initial reaction to your solution, etc. These conversations are documented and easily shared with me\n4. You preferably have at least 1 successful exit/company under your belt, or a couple of failed ones is OK too (but I would need references to make sure they failed for legitimate reasons) the worse is 0 years of experience starting a company.\n5. You are a cold email/call/outreach junkie. Because you will OWN sales in the early days. I want to see your 100 send emails or 100 daily calls or 100 sent DMs everyday asking potential customers for feedback or validation conversations or to sign up for your beta",
