Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.\nProfitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious.

Including if I know where I am at, where I go, or is there someone who could help me with these apparent struggles in my life.\nIt took me a couple awkward minutes to realize that I'm the only one standing on my feet and not sitting in a car wherever I was looking. I apologized (???) and told them I was heading to a museum, bc I'm a visitor here and that's what we do right? I added a colleague's address and assured them that I'm not \"confused\", and will take an Uber now.\nThis was simply unbelievable in my world; for the next week I observed my colleague, whenever they took me out, or went to somewhere: we never walked outside. From the building to the parking lot, from the destination parking lot to the resto and vice versa.\nToday, of course, I know that there are walkable cities too, I enjoy walking from my Chicago hotel to the office building :-) every single time I enjoy my US visits, but after a couple weeks I can't wait to get back to my 98% car free European life.",

Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!\nI wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).\nFrankly, I've enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I'd personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it's got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.\nFastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I've now written around a dozen apps with. I'm really loving it!\nI hope some of you get a chance to try it out -- let me know what you think.",

          "description": "I believe the original studies were shown to be faulty because they didn’t account for the fact that the cases were ordered. Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.\n“Danziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study—as well as other self-collected data—and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented—it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases”\n[1] Chatziathanasiou, K., 2022.

It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!\nWithout exploring, crafting and building, you can't survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.\nAnd people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.\nPulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn't just lucky.

          "description": "Nobody is against regulation that disfavors large incumbents to support competition instead.\nYou'll struggle to find people who are against the Digital Markets Act for this reason. It literally only targets the potential monopolists.\nHowever, virtually every other piece of regulation does the opposite.\nRegulation usually gets trotted out after the downside of doing [new innovation] is experienced. This always happens, because doing something new always involves unknown risk. Most people aren't entrepreneurs and hate risk, so they pass regulation, and the market gets locked down so nothing new happens again. Incumbents and their army of lawyers can easily comply or are grandfathered in, and challengers are permanently disadvantaged. That market is officially dead until the next fundamental leap forward in technology.\nWhat's different now though, is the hysteria over AI is leading regulators to pass this incumbent-cementing regulation before we've even had a chance to experience both the upside and downside, so the innovation never happens at all.\nCombine this with a rapidly aging demography in Europe, and I only see this trend increasing. If there's one thing old people hate, it's risk and doing new things. Meanwhile, those same old folks are expecting massive payouts (social benefits) via taxation of the same private sector they're currently kneecapping with red tape. While ironic, those two trends converging aren't great for Europe.",

In the case of Central States, the workers were asked to buy shares from the owner, probably using a portion of the salary they'd otherwise get. IOW, they're being underpaid relative to market, in exchange for ownership, expecting to get more later when they sell the shares.

Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day.\nIf the story is \"it should be the law that every company offers stock options\", then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above.\nIf the story is \"all companies must be fully employee-owned workers' cooperatives\", then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers' rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can't sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There's a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won't sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers' stake.",

In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo (x)) because bar&baz wasn’t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I’m going back in time here but it’s a nice simple example.\nIf you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date.

I even submitted my link to a bunch of off brand search engines to get my name out there.\nBut now there's AI bots scraping websites like iFixit literally a million times a day.\nI don't hate AI. I'm not an AI doomer. But that's fucking silly.\nMaybe it's just me or maybe Google is terrible these days, but all I could find were blog posts six months old or more that just listed individual scrapers that are probably outdated anyway. So I asked Claude 3.5 to generate me a robots.txt file to block all known AI scrapers and I think it did alright!

It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.\nA recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.\nUsually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.\nMaybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?",

So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let's get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I'll be switching to Bear's \"Plain HTML\" theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I'm not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!",

(I swear I could think of a better name)\nYou will need...\nA timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)\nA notebook / sheets of paper\nA pen\nHow to get started:\nStep 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.\n15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.\nStep 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). \n1.54:59 \nStep 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.\nStep 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. \n1.54:59 Distraction \nThat is all!\nNote:\nThese are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.\nNo usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.\nTry not to doze off during the challenge.\nTry not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.\nI have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!",

The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.\"\n– Belghast, Blaugust 2024 is Coming\nI hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...\nWish me luck.",
