(One of them was a Christian fundamentalist, as an aside.)\nThese two diplomats are agents of a genocidal state. Their job is to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Israel so that Israel can kill more Palestinians, wipe out the last remaining hospital, torture Palestinians, rape Palestinians (including, it appears, with dogs), deliberately snipe children in the head, cause a huge famine, and turn every building in Gaza into dust.\nAnd I’ve left a number of sickening crimes out.\nSo, am I sad they are dead? No. Am I going to pretend I give a shit when someone who supports genocide winds up dead? No. Every single pious well wishing for Biden is the equivalent of wishing Petain, the leader of Vichy France, who helped the Holocaust along, a good life.\nAll of these people are knowingly involved in genocide. They have had many opportunities to stop supporting mass murder and they have refused every single one of them.\nThey are all, forgive me for using the word, evil. The bad guys. Torture. Rape. Mass murder. Deliberate killing of children.\nIt is my dream that every single one of them will eventually hang from the neck for their crimes. No exceptions. And I think it would be wise to add the corporate leadership of companies like Palantir and Microsoft, both of which are helping the genocide along.\nThis is a moral stance, but it is also a pragmatic stance. People who have gotten away with genocide once are not the sort of people anyone wise wants in their society, or in a position of power anywhere. Once could easily become twice.\nYou don’t even have to give a damn about Palestinians, you just have to have good judgment and a concern for your own neck and the lives, rectums and limbs of people you care about.\nFrom the neck.

          "description": "Chinese and American flags flying together\n\nSince Industrialization military power has been a function of three factors:\nTechnology.\nIndustrial Capacity.\nPopulation.\nAs time goes buy population becomes less important (see, rise of drones), but it still matters. Think of it as something like Tech x IndCap x (Pop x .5).\nAmerica has a powerful military though most of the technology is one or two generations old. The general consensus is that Pakistan’s Chinese jets (themselves last gen tech) out-performed India’s Western jets.\nAt this point, China is ahead in about 80% of tech fields. China has 31% of world industrial capacity, and the US about 16%, meaning that China has about twice as much. Further China owns the entire supply chain for many of its technologies, whereas the US’s supply chai…",

          "description": "(Guest Post by Failed Scholar)\nSome of the shit I read coming from the UK is just…it’s hard to believe it can be true, it’s so retarded. Britain is truly a shining example to the world of exactly how NOT to run a country, a benchmark in deindustrialization and how to drive a society to ruin while turning it into a Gestapo fun house at the same time on behalf of a genocidal foreign country. It takes true talent to make that possible.\nJust before 7.15pm more than 20 uniformed police, some equipped with tasers, forced their way into Westminster Meeting House. They broke open the front door without warning or ringing the bell first, searching the whole building and arresting six women attending the meeting in a hired room.\n\n– Imagine arresting Quakers on behalf of a foreign genocidal state!

This is ostensibly about birthright citizenship, but perhaps the more important issue is  whether US District courts can impose injunctions nationwide.
