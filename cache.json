He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him.

          "description": "Because this opinion has surfaced a number of times here: Yes, Tolkien did care deeply about the realism of his world. And because he spent his whole life studying pre-modern societies, the societies he creates in Middle Earth do function very realistically. I think there are two reason why many readers miss this:\n(1) Much of Tolkien's world-building is implicit rather than explicit. He doesn't talk about Aragorn's tax policy because he doesn't need to; Aragorn is recognisably a feudal king and there is a standard way taxes are done a feudal system (i.e. the vassals take care of gathering them). Tolkien has a deep understanding of how such societies function, but much of this comes out indirectly in the story, through the way the characters behave and what they can and cannot do.\n(2) Pre-modern societies are so deeply different from modern ones (economically, culturally, and socially) that I think many readers stumble across things they find unexpected and dismiss it as \"unrealistic fantasy\", without understanding that in such a context, this is exactly how one would expect the world to work. For example, the deep devotion and self-sacrificial service Sam shows to Frodo is often discussed in terms of friendship (and it is a great friendship), but one cannot fully understand it unless one also understands it as a (very positive) master-servant relationship.\nIf you want a better understanding of the deeper realism of LotR, I cannot recommend Bret Devereaux' blog highly enough. He is an ancient military historian and has written extensive (but entertaining!) analyses of both LotR and GoT. See here for two samples: https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helm..., https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-wa...",

          "description": "I understand the frustration, but at the end of the day I think they do serve a purpose. They're not great at that purpose, but they're good enough and they generally produce false negatives (smart people fail) rather than false positives (you hire an idiot). And this makes sense, because a false negative is low cost (maybe you spend 50% longer interviewing candidates) but a false positive is high cost (you hire an idiot and have to spend months establishing that, firing them and starting the hiring process again).\nThe side effect of this though, is that it's an extremely painful process for the applicant. Even if you're a great software engineer, you're going to freeze up, miss something, have a bad day, and fail a few interviews. Now for most software engineers failure is an unusual and harrowing experience, so they react really badly to it. Especially ina \n scenario where it's difficult to blame anyone but yourself. But just don't! It's fine! just move on, there's plenty of jobs and the interview process is a blunt tool, not a final evaluation of your worth in life.",

          "description": "Leetcode style interviews probably serve two functions:\n1) A way to suppress wages and job mobility for SWE. Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.\n2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear/similar objective.\nMeet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…\nOr is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.\nTo the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.\nI’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree/number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.\nSomeone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree/number theory/inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.",

          "description": "Totally fair question! My reasons were:\n1. To maximize Photon's battery life I tried to make the hardware do the absolute minimum to record imagery. To that end, Photon stores images on an unformatted SD card (ie one huge linear array of bytes) which is easy and fast to index into.\n2. A 16-bit MSP430 handles writing the image data, and the MSP430's codespace is 99% exhausted without dealing with the complexities of a filesystem like FAT32, so adding support for a filesystem wouldn't currently fit. (This line of MSP430, MSP430FR2433, has a maximum of 16 KB of FRAM, but perhaps I could use a different line.)\n3. Photon stores images as RAW image data that require post-processing to view the images. Since I wanted to provide a polished app to view the imagery anyway, I figured I'd just make it a requirement.\nI'm not saying those are all particularly good reasons, but that was my reasoning anyhow.",

          "description": "I think there’s one flaw in the overall theory presented in the article: it was demand for coal for heating independent of the industrial revolution that really kickstarted things and the labor exploited for coal mining was the lowest of the socioeconomic classes. Before the industrial revolution England was already mining around five times more coal than the rest of the world combined just to survive winters. Once they exhausted the easy surface deposits they had to go deeper and deeper which required mechanized power to work against the water seeping in. The first engines were invented not when labor became too expensive but when it was impossible to do with human labor at all.\nAfter reading Coal - A Human History I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs and a surface supply of coal just big enough to get the industry started but not enough to supply the growing population without digging deeper.",

          "description": "Wasn't expecting my question to hit top of HN. I guess I'll give some context for why I asked it.\nI work in quantum error correction, and was trying to collect interesting and quantitative examples of repetition codes being used implicitly in classical systems. Stuff like DRAM storing a 0 or 1 via the presence or absence of 40K electrons [1], undersea cables sending X photons per bit (don't know that one yet), some kind of number for a transistor switching (haven't even decided on the number for that one yet), etc.\nA key reason quantum computing is so hard is that by default repetition makes things worse instead of better, because every repetition is another chance for an unintended measurement. So protecting a qubit tends to require special physical properties, like the energy gap of a superconductor, or complex error correction strategies like surface codes. A surface code can easily use 1000 physical qubits to store 1 logical qubit [2], and I wanted to contrast that with the sizes of implicit repetition codes used in classical computing.\n1: https://web.mit.edu/rec/www/dramfaq/DRAMFAQ.html\n2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928",

The 100 foot cable would have been a bit of a financial burden and going to buy it and then run it the long way around would have eaten the rest of my day and this was resolved in minutes because I always encouraged my kids to ask questions and didn't treat them like that was \"disrespecting my authority\" or something.",

I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.\nMy old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.\nAnyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me.

From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.",

Lame ducks can mess around and get away with a lot of things they might not otherwise if they were facing re-election.\nI like to use that term to describe the habit I have of completely abandoning my usual routine before big life changes like going to college or starting a new job. This week I've replaced my usual routine of exercise and healthy eating with junk food binges and late bedtimes. Instead of reading and writing before bed I play videogames.

When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn't know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn't that easy.\nAfter he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn't really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…",

In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.\nHe replies:\nYes, it is. I can panic if I'm not allowed to write.\nI think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.\nIf I don't write in one form or another, it's like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn't matter. Just get it out of the system.\nI think it was Stephen King who said something like:\n\"If you don't have time to read, how will you have time to write?”\nFor me, it's the other way around. If I don't write, there's no way I can be fully present and absorb what I'm reading.\nWriting is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts.

I published the first post, It's alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\nAfter about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I'm not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.\nI tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:\nBear\nPika\nScribbles\nThey are all fantastic! If you're on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!\nFor me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.\nWhen I say \"forever,\" I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it's a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I'm very happy to have found my way back.\nI look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other \"Bears\" publish in this beautiful community.\nHappy blogging!\nall posts · rss feed",

The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. \n The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes. Sometimes, when f…",

It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…",

Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. \n If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…",

That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming?
