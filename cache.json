This means that the destructive power of the explosives dropped on Gaza in just over two months exceeded that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[4] According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the use of such highly destructive bombs in residential areas constitutes a war crime.

That amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion. Not to be outdone in the stupidity sweepstakes, Joe “Copycat” Biden added his tariffs.

Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers.

On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:\ncgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet\nand CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use\nthe same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a\nsource of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!\nAutomated cgroup driver detection\nIn v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate\nKubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI\nimplementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes\nhappened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations\n(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!\nIn addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their\nCRI implementation is new enough:\ncontainerd: Support was added in v2.0.0\nCRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0\nThen, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the\ncgroup_driver they would like to use.\nFuture work\nEventually, support for the kubelet's cgroupDriver configuration field will be\ndropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn't new\nenough to have support for this feature.",

I'm often grateful for some of life's little comforts over and over again, things like a good meal I didn't have to cook or an especially entertaining show on TV. A long time ago, I read The Miracle of Mindfulness by Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh in which he encourages a junior monk to peel an orange while savoring the moment, to do nothing but feel and smell and taste the orange. When I have the presence of mind to do such things, I like to savor moments of small joy while they are happening and then to reflect on them afterwords.

I don't feel like I have anything particularly valuable to contribute, and I think I'm a mediocre writer.\nI believe many people can relate to this. That's just how it is with that inner critic, it's never satisfied. There's always something that isn't good enough.\nIf we treated other people the way we treat ourselves, we wouldn't have any friends left. And we'd probably get slapped around now and then for our terrible behavior.\nIf we list our favorites when it comes to books, movies, music, etc., then surely many of the creators would absolutely disagree. The creator and the created are too closely intertwined. There is no space for a fair judgement.\nPerhaps this is precisely what we need to remind ourselves of when self-doubt is knocking at the door, and self-criticism is wagging its finger.

I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time.

Maybe I’m just impatient, but it’s incredibly frustrating to spend time messing around with code and end up with nothing to show for it. I mentioned this in another blog, but I still don’t know how to feel about it. Is it me? Is it just the nature of programming?\nI’ve been coding as a hobbyist for a while, but this year I decided to take it more seriously and learn better practices. I wanted to make coding a daily habit. However, as I dive into more complex repositories, I often find myself going down a rabbit hole of reading docs, code, and comments, trying to figure out what I need to produce the results I want. I end up coding all day, only to see a few lines of code actually make it into the final product.\nIt’s definitely a lack of domain knowledge in the libraries I’m using, but is there no faster way to learn them?\nNow that I think about it, I’ve been exploring a lot of new repos lately—botting, Roblox scripting, Textual, and Hugo. Maybe it’s just an odd situation where I feel like I’m drowning in technology.\nDo you feel the same way? If you’re more experienced, does this feeling go away as you get better? I doubt it.

The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!\nBut over time, something started to feel off. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.\nThen one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.\n– Yes, I can't imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.\nIn that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!\nWhen I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.\nFast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.\nAnd when it comes to IT, I'm more passionate about it now that it's a hobby instead of a career.

Seemed like the right idea.”\nMy heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”\nSurely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.\nSometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”\nIn all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.\nI just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about.

Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.\nIt’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.\nI think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.\nLet’s talk about this: [e-mail] [Facebook]",

Because I noticed around 10PM that jumpcomedy.com was entirely broken with all HTTP POST calls made by RTK Query failing. Nothing worked and though I had deployed recent changes, none of them would cause this. I was at a complete loss as to where to look, especially as this is working locally.

I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.\nI remind myself that becoming is a lifelong journey that never truly ends.

You might have explored a topic you're curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: \"all the time!\"\nPlease, re-read the question.\nI didn't ask when was the last time you learned something new. I'm talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.\nMaybe I'm alone in this feeling, but it's been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.\nThat's why, from now on, I'm going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.\nI'm currently working on my syllabus, which I'll gladly share with you once I've finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other's schedules).\nTake a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.\nI can't wait to learn with you all.",
