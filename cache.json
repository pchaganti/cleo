          "description": "On December 17, a Dutch nonprofit organization dedicated to corporate accountability, SOMO, published a study of Israel’s energy sector amid the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip. Since Palestinian militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, Israeli forces have killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, including 17,000 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, as cited by Al Jazeera. The true toll of the genocide — obscured by continued Israeli attacks, blockade and propaganda — may top 330,000 deaths by the end of the year, per estimates published in The Guardian.\nTo read this article, log in here or subscribe here.\nIf you are logged in but can't read CP+ articles, check the status of your access here\nIn order to read CP+ articles, your web browser must be set to accept cookies.\t\t    \n\n\t\t More\nThe post Europe Continues to Import Israeli Gas Amid Genocide in Gaza appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

This may be an underestimation, as Psychiatric News reported later in 2024, “More than 1,500 intravenous (IV) infusion clinics have proliferated nationwide.” Ketamine industry revenues of $3.1 billion were reported in 2022, and projected to be $6.9 billion by 2030.

          "description": "Now having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one's team (/one's department) and market oneself (one's team) to your manager (/your company).\nSo much mental bandwidth was spent.\nI also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete InputOutput expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you've effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let's say you're in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is 'number of suicides averted'. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that's instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you're doing X, but you're really doing Y. Because you're disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies.",

I was, briefly, the No. 1 telemarketer in the United States.\nOh neat, how?\n> Unlike many of my less successful colleagues, I quickly learned to take yes for an answer; though we were legally required to read a long list of mandatory disclosures to all our sales, I noticed that this often broke the spell and gave people an opening to back out or “wait and ask the wife about it.” As soon as I heard a yes, I said, “Great choice!” and transferred them to confirmation. My manager occasionally came by and reminded me that it was technically illegal to skip my disclosures, but he made commission off my commission, and his tone made it clear that I could do as I pleased as long as I kept putting up numbers.\n[…]\n> I was one of the first to go, technically for not making my required disclosures—about cancellation fees, international rates, all that fine print nobody ever bothered to recite—on a sale.\nSo, he and his boss did crime together for a while and then eventually their scam stopped working and he got fired.",

It's a free 5.5x speedup that renders some of the other optimizations, like trying to memoize digit sums, unnecessary.\nOn an m1 macbook pro, using numpy to generate the random numbers, using mod/div to do digit sum:\nBase: 55ms\nTest before digit sum: 7-10ms, which is pretty close to the numba-optimized version from the post with no numba and only one line of numpy. Using numba slows things down unless you want to do a lot of extra work of calculating all of the digit sums in advance (which is mostly wasted).\nThe LLM appears less good at identifying the big-o improvements than other things, which is pretty consistent with my experience using them to write code.",

I've heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like \"I now enjoy making other people rich.\"\nNo matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances).

We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.\n> The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.
