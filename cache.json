You might deploy this system for business-level insights into how events are flowing through your organization or to visualize the flow of transactions in real time. Downstream services also will have the option to process and respond to events originating within the system or not.",

Seems forcing people to do what they don’t want to do, in what is usually a socially oppressive environment, is bad for them.\nThere are, of course, those who thrive in school, and love it, usually the socially dominant kids. But for a lot of kids, school is Hell.\nThis has a lot to do with alignment of goals, I think. I wrote recently about the epidemic of AI cheating and how to avoid it, but I think the smartest commentary I’ve seen on AI cheating, and cheating in general is this one:\nHas anyone stopped to ask WHY students cheat?

Anyway, tariffs are back to 10% on either side and negotiations will continue.\nNote that China got what they wanted, minus 10%—no negotiations until the tariffs are removed.\nThere will still be a two month trade burp. Ships weren’t leaving China for the US at all, literally zero. Lot of freight companies are about to make a mint, though. So expect some shortages, but nothing worse than Covid, and hopefully lasting less time.\nThe fundamental problem remains, however, which is that there’s no certainty around any of this, so business people can’t make long term plans, including plans to build or relocate manufacturing. Trump and the US can’t be trusted to stay steady on policy, so avoiding making big plans involving the US makes sense.\nThe Great Power picture is clearer, however. The US tried to impose its will on China and failed. China wouldn’t negotiate till its pre-conditions were met. The world has two great powers, with the EU bidding to become the third (I think they’ll fail, but that’s what the rearmament is about.)\nAnd, in economic terms, China is by far the pre-eminent great power. It isn’t even close. The era of American hegemony is officially over. The US tried to impose its will on the world and failed.\nThis blog has always been free to read, but it isn’t free to produce.

I believe in the truth as much as I believe it is capable to be objective. Anyone who says that an “objective journalist is a myth,” is a liar with an agenda. Do we all have biases? You bet. It is in the recognition of said biases and overcoming them is how the truth emerges.\nThat said, the best, most balanced site concerning operational, strategic and tactical reporting on the Russo-Ukrainian Warcan be found at the Austrian Military Academy.\nThese two are the most recent, here and the Ukrainian Purgatory, here.
