In a single day, X lost 22 million users, while alternative platform Blue Sky gained 2 million new Brazilian users in just three days. The order to ban the platform initially came from Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, a figure vilified by the Bolsonaros and the international far right, and was ratified by a 5-0 vote in the Supreme Court's 1st working group three days later.

In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.",

The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.\nAnd towards the end\n> Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere... But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.\nI love reading about landfills.

The obvious place this still falls apart is that an attacker could just\n    ln /bin/curl ./some\\ other\\ name\n\nbut there are sometimes security measures that we use even though they're less than 100% effective so it at least conceivable that this might be a trade off worth making.",

Searching for “fn doTheThing” or “defun do-the-thing” ensures that you find the actual definition. Meanwhile C lacks any such keyword, so the best you can do is search for the name. That gets you a sea of callers with the declarations and definitions mixed in. Some C coding conventions have you split the definition into two lines, first the return type on a line followed by a second line that starts with the function name. It looks ugly, but at least you can search for “^doTheThing” to find just the definition(s).",

If you have a wide-gamut display, the test is probably gonna appear different.\nBut another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window, which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we're staring at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do \"auto white balance\" that skews the results. It's the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.\nTo address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller, or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.",

What Changes When You Are Free\n> You will not be forced to work inside something known as a “virtual environment.”\nOof, this terrible advice cancels out an otherwise reasonable post. Beginners who don't know what they're doing are the last people who should be `pip install -r requirements.txt`-ing into the system Python the way this article is recommending. That's not only going to make working on multiple projects nearly impossible (especially for the kind of beginning students who get recommended Anaconda, which are almost always the Data Science-y crowd using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit, etc, which are notoriously finicky with version conflicts), but it stands a good chance of breaking other Python-based system utilities in completely opaque ways. This sort of advice can fubar a naive user's entire workflow.\nI know virtualenvs suck to explain to people, but in my opinion it needs to be done before you ever tell them about `pip install`.",

At my current company, I see the CEO doing the exact same thing, which gives me great hope.  Huge contrast from my previous start-up, for which I have great anti-hope unfortunately.  (Current company is Zap Surgical Systems, with Dr. John Adler as the founder.)  I've seen John everywhere, all day every day.  I've seen him literally on his hands and knees under our robotic treatment table back in the engineering lab, discussing details with a young mechanical engineer.  And yeah, we are curing cancer ;-)\nTo re-iterate:  What I believe PaulG is saying is that there is a crucially important phenomenon that we don't yet understand, and naming it will facilitate the process of bringing it into focus so that we can help more companies be successful.\nHis footnote has a painful resonance:  \"I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it.\"\nThis is exactly what has happened to the Agile methodology.",

Reed insisted on a particular style of employee freedom & responsibility that IMO set the benchmark for innovating year after year and avoiding micro-managers, even as it scaled up past 2000 engineers. This story still has not been fully told.  Reed was closely involved but perhaps the opposite of Steve Jobs.\nSounds like chesky and pg want to turn the tide on that dominant culture in software companies.  And I couldn't agree more!  A big problem IMO is that most \"professional software managers\" are taught a management style that focuses on risk.  Risk-aversion permeates every decision from compensation to project priorities.  It's so pervasive it's like the air they breathe, they don't even realize their doing it.  This is how things run in 99% of companies.\nSo, my fellow hackers.  There is a better way.  It's neither the Steve Jobs model nor the John Sculley model.  Looks like pg has not yet found it.  I hope he does, though.  It would be great for YC to encourage experimentation here.",

Various separate services for search, algorithms, and images. Hybrid on-prem & cloud. There are ~20 of the k/v servers, 1 event-stream, 2 scylla clusters (I believe).\nThe event-stream crash would cause the application to stop making progress on ingesting events, but we still got the writes, so you'd see eg likes failing to increment the counter but then magically taking effect 60 seconds later.

A crow attacked me out of the blue. Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me. Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building. That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me. It was a little spooky.\nWhen I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley. The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony. On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape. Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.\nI went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder. To this day it still amazes me that the crow's mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs.",

Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.\nDuring that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was \"Frankenstein\") and tried to read it.\nI didn’t have my laptop, internet, TV, or even a paper dictionary at the time.

          "description": "I've been thinking about something lately. Something that's the complete opposite of how I usually do things — and it feels really good.\nIt's primarily the work on the Bearming theme that made me realize this. Before, I always wanted to have the whole picture clear in my mind beforehand. I tweaked and fiddled, turned it this way and that before finally deciding to release something.\nThere's been this idea that \"everything has to be perfect.\" This has resulted in spending a huge amount of time before pressing the publish button. There are several problems with such an approach...\nFor one thing, there is no external feedback whatsoever when I'm sitting and tinkering behind closed doors. It becomes a limited creation process with a very narrow perspective. A one-man show for something that's intended for an audience.\nAnother problem with creating \"for my eyes only\" is that the public announcement will never get a response that matches the time spent on the project. It leads to a feeling of scarcity, that it's not worth it. I've spent all this time, and this is all I get?\nThe new approach for me of creating publicly feels incredibly liberating and refreshing. I first released a beta of the theme and have since refined it and added new things along the way. Having a changelog also reinforces the feeling of continuity and development on a creatively rewarding level.\nI'm going to try to implement the same mindset with my entire blog. Revisiting old posts, reviewing the content, maybe adding tags or an image, and so on. A never-ending project without timeframes.\nBits and pieces that slowly, one step at a time, make for a more detailed and interesting picture – that's the kind of digital painting I want to keep creating.",

The next day I changed my mind, which I wrote about in the post \"The blog that refuses to die.\"\nYesterday, I launched a membership called Birming Buddies. When I woke up this morning after a long and good night's sleep, I realized it didn't feel right. I have now removed the page.\nIt probably sounds crazy – and maybe it is.\nBut neither the decision to start Birming Buddies nor to shut down the blog were impulsive actions. It's always been a long period of consideration before I hit the OK button. Once I've done that, I quickly realize whether it was the right decision or not.\nIt's as if I can't reason my way through some decisions. I have to put them into action to really be able to determine what is right and what is not. Not very practical, I know, but that's apparently how I work.\nAnyway, no harm done. The member fees are  refunded and the blog lives on. And I'll continue to develop the Bearming theme. Today I released an add-on to show excerpts of your blog posts (see example on my home page), and a new color palette named Green Screen.\nI hope you have the patience to continue following my rather crooked blog journey. Hopefully, the transparency will bring some comfort to those who can relate.\nBy the way, I also launched a newsletter today.
