They discuss the process of pulling their works out of the exhibition; the importance of the academic and cultural boycott of Israel (PACBI); and what it means to be Jewish artists publicly confronting Jewish arts institutions that receive Zionist funding and are struggling to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.\nSteph Kudisch is a trans genderfluid artist whose work uses mutated intertidal aesthetics and personal storytelling to dwell in in-betweens. They work as a teaching artist on Lisjan Ohlone land, also known as the San Francisco Bay Area. Kudisch and their collaborator Kate Laster form Clear as Schmutz Press as well as the collective Hevra Kadisha in which they create site-specific works across the mediums of printmaking, sculpture, performance, and sound.\nSophia Sobko (she/they) is an artist, educator & researcher born in Moscow, USSR & based on Lisjan Ohlone Land in Oakland, CA. They are excited about collaborative learning, participatory art, and co-creating a more liberatory world. Sophia is founder/co-steward of two queer post-Soviet Jewish collectives: Kolektiv Goluboy Vagon and Krivoy Kolektiv.\nGet in touch with CJAFP at cajewishartists4palestine[@]proton.me More\nThe post California Jewish Artists for Palestine: Sophia Sobko and Steph Kudisch appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.",

          "description": "Mortgage balances, the largest component of U.S. household debt, grew by only $77 billion (0.6 percent) in the second quarter of 2024, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data. This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.",

These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.",

So, this is no coincidence\nOrdinarily, this would be extremely indicative of a coincidence. If you’re looking for a heuristic for non-coincidences, “sticks around when you change units” is the one you want. This is just an unusual case where that heuristic fails.",

          "description": "Was shocked to hear this news. I worked for Google years ago but I was in the NYC office, so we didn't run into the YouTube folks much.\nOpinions about YouTube may be mixed here on HN, but it is objectively one of the most successful businesses in tech or media to emerge in the past 15 years. If it weren't buried inside Alphabet, Youtube would be worth on the order of $400 billion, more than Disney and Comcast combined. It's a weird mix of a huge creator monetization network, a music channel, an education platform, a forever-store of niche content, and a utility.\nIt's also not a business that rested on it's laurels. It's easy to forget how novel creator monetization was when YouTube adopted it. They do a lot of active work to manage their creators, and now have grown into a music and podcast platform that is challenging Apple. To top it off, YouTube TV, despite costing just as much as cable, is objectively a good product.\nFew products have the brand, the reach, monetization, and the endurance that YouTube has had within Google. And I know for a fact that this is in no small part due to the way it was managed.\nI've probably watched tens of thousands of hours of YouTube at this point. Some of it sublime, some of it absurd, some of it critical for my work or my degree. I couldn't imagine a world without it.\nRIP.",

RIP.\nEdit: some people misinterpreted my comment. I'm just one anonymous  voice on the Internet, but am deeply saddened by the passing of Susan Wojcicki, who meant a lot to me as one of the many people who crossed paths with her professionally. I wish her family strength in a very trying moment. She did not deserve this. I've not met another business leader demonstrate everyday kindness to the degree that she did.\nHer untimely passing is also a reminder to those of us who sometimes look up to such successful businesspeople that we should all appreciate our luck to be alive and enjoy it to the fullest, as I hope that she did as well, and as I'm sure that she'd prefer we did.

The intellectual online community which made up a big piece of his life for so long was important to him, as was having a positive influence on others, and it would have meant so much to him- as it does to me- to see the impact he made. Thank you for the people who reached out while he was still alive to make sure he knew just how large that impact was.\nI've lost the love of my life, as well as my thinking and writing partner, and everything is strange and disorienting right now. It's a comfort when nothing feels comfortable to know how appreciated he was and still is. As soon as I'm able, and for anyone who is interested in joining the efforts, I promised him I'd continue the push for FDA reform, and to try to find ways to improve agency for cancer patients so that other people in his position might suffer less than he did. I've never known a braver person. I'll miss him forever, but won't stop trying to keep his legacy alive.\nPlease feel free to reach out anytime (I'm at drbstillman@gmail.com). Thank you also for all the well wishes for myself and Athena, who I hope will be just like her Dad.",

          "description": "My biggest frustration with .internal is that it requires a private certificate authority. Lots of organizations struggle to fully set up trust for the private CA on all internal systems. When you add BYOD or contractor systems, it's a mess.\nUsing a publicly valid domain offers a number of benefits, like being able to use a free public CA like Lets Encrypt. Every machine will trust your internal certificates out of the box, so there is minimal toil.\nLast year I built getlocalcert [1] as a free way to automate this approach. It allows you to register a subdomain, publish TXT records for ACME DNS certificate validation, and use your own internal DNS server for all private use.\n[1] https://www.getlocalcert.net/",

The advantage of this strategy is if the experiment doesn't work out, terminating freelancers is much easier than permanent (I noted you're based in Europe).\nContrary to what other people said, I wouldn't try find a CTO straightaway. It's a hard role to hire for, especially at the start.

Their pad abort test (where you simulate a launch abort while on the launch pad) resulted in only 2 of the 3 parachutes deploying in beyond optimal conditions. NASA considered that such a resounding success that they let them completely skip the far more challenging in-flight abort test. Their first automated mission to the ISS completely failed and did not make it to the station. NASA finally required a redo from Boeing and their second one did make it to the ISS, but only after experiencing widespread leaks and thruster failures literally identical to the ones that have now left these astronauts stranded.\nIf SpaceX or another company had remotely similar results, they would never have been greenlit. For instance in spite of a flawless pad abort test, NASA required SpaceX also carry out an in-flight abort. And that's completely reasonable - you don't simply skip tests, even with optimal performance. Skipping tests following suboptimal performance is simply unjustifiable. And so I think we're largely looking at another Challenger type disaster caused by a disconnect between management (and likely political appointees) versus engineering staff, rather than inherent risk. But this is not a vessel that should have ever had a single human anywhere near it, and so their official comments (and even actions) on the situation are going to be heavily biased due to their own behaviors.",

          "description": "I listened to the whole conference and here's my impression:\n1. NASA manager Steve Stich said there's a relatively wide \"band of uncertainty\" in how risky a Starliner return is. Some (many?) NASA engineers are at the high end of the band and are advocating a return on Dragon instead. Boeing is obviously at the low end of the band and thinks it is a low risk.\nThe problem is, the data doesn't rule out either side of the band. So they are trying to get more data to narrow the uncertainty (in either or both directions). [Interestingly enough, the data from the White Sands testing made them more worried because it revealed the Teflon seal deformation.]\nBut my sense is that if they don't narrow the uncertainty (i.e., convince the NASA engineers) then they will very likely choose a Dragon return.…",

          "description": "I’ve built quite a few french drains in residential settings, some lasting longer than others - I’ll share a few hard earned lessons here:\nSoil migration is the number one failure mode. This is mentioned but perhaps a bit understated in the video.\nTo prevent soil migration you absolutely need commercial grade geotextile fabric wrapping the gravel and pipe.\nYou can buy pipe with much bigger and more numerous holes than the tiny slits depicted in the video. That also obviates the need to decide what orientation the holes should be.\nVoid space is the most critical factor when choosing gravel. You need a lot of space between the rocks to support fast drainage. Do not use playground pebbles or anything similar. Pay close attention to the type of aggregate you’re buying.\nCalculate how much water you actually need to drain. You can use the “100 year flood” values for your locale to get an upper bound on rainfall, then multiple by drainage area. This is especially important if your roof is part of the watershed.\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/sci...\nSometimes there is insufficient gradient to move the water anywhere, ie the land is too flat. In this case you may be better off building a drywell, which is constructed very similarly.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_well",

If we don't consider the CEO's influence, I'm actually curious if the location of company headquarters has to do with the average age of the employees in the Bay Area. As the employees start to have families, they most likely move to the south bay for better or for worse, and I have a hard time imagine that they'd enjoy commuting via BART or Caltrain for more than an hour every day. And this is probably just me or my circles, a city's hustle and bustle becomes a distraction or at least increasing irrelevant as I age. I increasingly enjoy ample parking space, tranquil suburbs, being able to step out and start jogging in woods or huge parks, and certainly not having to deal with the craziness on SF streets. If more people are like me who prefers living outside of the city proper, then I'd imagine a company will have access to more talent by moving its headquarters to the south of SF.",

          "description": "Good job releasing your project! It's a cool idea and surprisingly minimalist. That said, I've found a number of cryptographic flaws in the application source. This should not be used in instances where the encryption is mission-critical.\n1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it's far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.\n2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.\n3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.\n4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (\"#\") which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it's important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the \"#\". If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).\n[0]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L99\n[1]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L287\n[2]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475.pdf\n[3]: https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/",

Celebrated my mother's birthday\nToday my brothers and I celebrated my mom's birthday. We took her out to dinner at a steak house and went to watch the new Deadpool movie afterwards. My dad even bought her a bouquet of flowers as he is overseas at the moment, she really seemed to enjoy that.\n2. I almost lost over a thousand dollars\nI woke up this morning to a huge number of unauthorised charges on my card, I immediately tried to freeze or cancel my card but because my bank's system was under maintenance, I had to sit in anxiety and hope no new charges came in until the system was back up. I managed to cancel my card and get a new one issued but I still have to dispute any pending transactions to get my money back.\n3. 4000 Japanese words learnt\nI finally hit the milestone of learning 4000 Japanese words, according to my Anki stats. Super happy that I've kept up this habit of learning Japanese everyday for almost 200 days straight.\n10/31",

          "description": "\"We are all different\" – a phrase thrown around quite often. And thankfully, it's true. Some adore winter, others summer; some thrive in nature, while others prefer the city.\nBut there's one area where this diversity seems absent: socializing.\nThe first to leave a party is branded a bore. Anyone declining a gathering is deemed a weirdo. Going to the movies alone marks you as strange.\nWhy is this? Why does socializing always trump solitude? It's as if loneliness is automatically equated with something being wrong.\nThere's a lot of talk about the importance of online privacy, but when it comes to wanting some privacy in the physical world, it's a different story. We're expected to be \"online\" by default, 24/7. If we go \"offline,\" it's treated as a malfunction — a 404 page.\nPeople often tell me I'm a social person. Sure, I enjoy listening to others, asking questions, and reflecting on their experiences in light of my own. But it comes with a price...\nAfter two or three hours, I'm exhausted. I experience a \"social hangover.\" Everyone seems to be talking endlessly about nothing, as if there's a collective fear of silence and stillness.\nWhy is solitude taboo?\nI don't have the answers, but I've gotten better at announcing my early departure. It still feels odd to do so, and occasionally, I'm met with confusion. But honestly, I don't care — I'm too old for that, and it feels incredibly liberating.",

Ever since I started writing on this website, I've received the most heartwarming reactions—from plain old emails to guestbook comments, and in some cases, even reply posts that can spark discussions in what might otherwise feel like posting into the void.\nA reply post like this was RE: Why Are Shoes Treated Differently Than Shirts by Marisabel, which really made me think about stuff I wrote in my original post. I loved that! She mentioned me on Mastodon, and I thanked her for the reply, it really made my day back then.\nLast week, I discovered another reply through the analytics page of my bear blog, which had a referrer I wasn’t familiar with—mgx. I visited the website and found a reply post to my bat incident! It had a short poem about it, which made me laugh and brightened my day, especially since I was feeling quite sick after the vaccine.\nI wanted to thank mgx for the reply, but I couldn’t find a way to contact on the website.

I don't mean it has drastically perked my English grammar or refined my sentence structure (though these have definitely been a bonus). Instead, it makes me write more, and, subjectively, that is my definition of a good writer: someone who writes.\nBefore Bearblog, I had a penchant for perfectionism with writing, which made me avoid it for years. For my first blogpost, I was rusty from the lack of practice, and I faced difficulty expressing my internal chaos of thoughts & ideas into coherent phrasing. I was practically forcing out words. That paid off, though, because regular Bearblogging has made my words come more naturally now. I easily phrase whatever crosses my mind, writing as I go along…",

          "description": "Yesterday, I read a post by Bearly Significant titled: \"Headlines Terrify Me\". The post talked about the nuances of creating the perfect headline, that one time they made a typo, and their fear of sabotaging themselves with their words.\nThe post starts:\nCrafting an effective headline is an art form mastered only by the finest journalists and editors. In fewer words than a tweet, all nuances and \"yes, buts\" must be simplified. This is crucial because journalists are taught to always consider: \"if someone only reads the headline, will they be somewhat informed?\"\nAlthough the blog post was geared more towards the news sector, I can’t help but think that there is some parallelism with how bloggers craft their blog post titles.\nI think everyone has their own flavor of titling their posts that works with their niche, and blogging voice. I follow a few who title their blog posts…\nIn a super vague way that makes you want to click on the post to understand what their title means\nShort and straight to the point - you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into and the topic of the post\nA poetic title that encompasses the topic of the post\nA few words excerpt from their actual post\n…and so on.\nI think I do a mixture of some of the above. I tend to lean towards a blog title that evokes the same emotion as what I’m writing about. If it’s a more poetic piece, I title it as such. If it’s more casual, the title also tends to be. Although there are times when my posts tend to be vague, the goal is to rarely make the title vague. I always want you to know what you’re getting into so you can choose to read, or pass on my posts. I hate clickbait, and so I try to avoid that as much as I can.\nMy blog is pretty straight forward. What you see is typically what you get.\n8/31 - Blaugust\nReply by email",

          "description": "Hello fellow blogger,\nI found your blog and the \"Finding my Blogging Voice\" post through Bear's 'Most Recent' feed and felt like writing a reply.\nIt's wonderful to see that you got your first post out there. A good and interesting one too, that many bloggers can relate to. Now that you're up and running, the hardest part is over.\nI've been in a similar situation myself and understand how you feel. My advice is to not overthink it and just keep writing and posting, writing and posting, writing and posting...\nI always find myself thinking I could do better, write better, be better.\nWe can all do better, and the only way to achieve it is by consistently publishing content. Plus, what we consider our \"best writing\" today, will be replaced by \"even better\" soon. Looking back at what I thought was my \"best writing ever\" five years ago, I wouldn't even publish it today.\nBesides, we're terrible at being our own critics. We'll post texts we believe are outstanding, only to see them go by unnoticed. And we'll post texts we hesitate to share, which end up being our most read ever.\nBlogging is like a school without final exams, that’s what makes it so valuable and rewarding.\nJust keep on blogging and never skip class.\nGood luck!\nUpdate\nThe original post by \"Thoughtless Ramblings\" made ripples in cyberspace. Another great example of the beauty of blogging. A first post was all it took...\nBlog posts\nBearly Significant\nYou?\nMastodon\nI had a hard time finding my voice. I always felt like I needed to perform for someone with my writing. Took me a while to feel comfortable just writing for myself and to get stuff out of my head. And I think the way I see it now is like I'm doing an impromptu presentation and some people might stop and listen. — Juan Villela",

It means treating yourself with the same respect you would treat anyone else with. You wouldn't tell someone something even half as cruel as the things you tell yourself. So why would you tell yourself those things?\nHis overall message comes down to self-love being something not about vanity but about developing a deep sense of self-assurance, acceptance, and trust with yourself.

With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.\nI have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.\nEvery day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel.
