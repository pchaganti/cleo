Raised in the rolling hills of Downe on the outskirts of London -- a village most famous for its association with Charles Darwin -- Farage attended Eden Park Preparatory School in the 1970s. His wealthy parents then paid for his attendance at one of South London’s most prestigious old boys’ clubs, Dulwich College. Farage’s germinal racism was public even at this early age, and in 1981, his fascist mannerisms were played down as ordinary “naughtiness” by his college’s “Master” when he chose to make him a prefect More\nThe post Racism in the Life of Farage: From Enoch Powell to Reform UK appeared first on CounterPunch.org.",

          "description": "This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).",

          "description": "I'm definitely not against the usage of AI. It's a very helpful and powerful tool for many things. It's being used for web designs, graphical elements, illustrations, articles, videos, stories, etc.\nHowever, I think we might be missing one thing. For me, one of the reasons I love certain content, designs, and articles is because they are human-made. Human made things are not perfect. Imperfection makes the whole story/concept/design better. The beauty and charm lie in the imperfections and the fact that I know it's done by another living being like me. Thanks to this fact, I form connections to the things I consume.\nPersonally, I can not feel emotional connection to AI-made products. It does not matter if it is perfect or not. As soon as I know that it is AI-made, I start to dislike it suddenly. It's definitely not a rational way of thinking and is completely emotional, I know. But that's where AI might have difficulties understanding human behavior. Humans are unpredictable and imperfect. Stories — the whole process of creating something from beginning to end — are really important for humans, and knowing that there is a human in the process makes it more valuable.\nSo I think that, in the future, AI-made things might start to be something that people might try to avoid on purpose, and value non-AI-made/human-made things much more just because they are human-made, imperfect and have a story in it. People might start to demand non-AI works. \\ AI might lose it's popularity just because of being AI.",

          "description": "One of my favorite childhood memories is eating watermelons in the summer. Not just the carnal joy of eating them — crunching the sweetness between my teeth and feeling the wetness run down my chin — but the rest of the process too. Watching my dad slap and thump the melons in the supermarket to pick a good one while my brother and I clowned around and mimicked him. Crowding around the cutting board to seeing if we split open a good one. And of course, the best part: spooning the first bite of dark red flesh from the center and watching the juice pour into the crater left behind.\nA crate of watermelons greeted me at the supermarket last week and I decided I wanted to buy one for the first time, just to try it. After slapping a few cluelessly (are they supposed to talk back to you or something?) I pushed my cart to a corner and looked up how to pick a good watermelon. I ended up coming across this helpful graphic:\n\nI don't know what my dad was listening for when he tapped and slapped all those watermelons. Like with most things, I'm sure I asked him about it and promptly forgot his answer. In hindsight, I don't think he was that good at choosing them, despite growing up on a farm, because he took home a number of watermelons that were pale and watery inside. And I've been thinking about that as I sprinkle tajín on my watermelon slices and drip pink juice on the counter, how he was probably winging it too, along with the rest of adult- and parenthood, the same way I was slapping watermelons at the market last week and feeling like a fool waiting to be found out.",

          "description": "Hi Loren,\nThe story of how I found your blog is an interesting one. It fits perfectly with why I'm writing this to you (and any other reader who stumbles upon it). I came across a post by Chris on Uncountable about the magic of reading blog posts on the original website. He linked to your post with the same title. This is how the IndieWeb is supposed to work: you visit someone's website via a link and then embark on an adventure through the indie jungle, arriving somewhere you didn't expect.\nThese moments are magical. Adventures like these lead you from one scenic website to another. It's like walking through an ancient forest that seems straight out of The Lord of the Rings, only to find a light at the end where you enter a place as stunning as Rivendell.\nThis post could have been a Fw: (forward) instead of a Re: (reply). I couldn't agree more with your statement:\n\"These bloggers put time and effort into making their websites – the design, the 'About Me' page, the Archives. In an app, all that disappears, replaced by a sterile, uniform layout.\"\nThe real magic is in this effort, the years of tears and sweat that people put into creating their websites. It's something you completely miss out on when reading everything in the blandness of an RSS reader. It's like watching Mad Max on the tiny screen of your phone instead of the magnificent and overwhelming IMAX cinema experience.\nThere is so much enchantment in taking that little extra effort to open a post on someone's website.\nThis is where the real IndieWeb comes to life.\nWith love,\nYordi",

The observer and the observed are too close to each other to make a fair judgment. It's like looking at a painting up close and thinking it looks terrible. It's like a trial where the judge and the defendant are the same person.\nWe are in a constant state of bias when it comes to judging our work.\nAnyone who's been blogging for a while has experienced this: You post something you almost threw away because you thought it was garbage, and it turns out to be one of your most popular posts.\nBias.\nNext time you find yourself with your index finger resting on the delete button, move it to publish.

On days like that, it's hard to believe you're at work.\nThis time, the sky opened up, and the rain poured down for a short while. The sky looked amazingly powerful as I stood on the shore and looked out over the ocean.\nIt's stunning how small you feel at times like this. Not only that, but your worries and problems also feel small. Things that you otherwise attach great importance to suddenly don’t feel all that important there and then. You just stand there with your smallness somewhere in the vastness of the universe and marvel — everything stops.\nA few hours later, I stepped ashore, jumped on my bike, and felt how everyday life was slowly but surely making its way back…\n\"I have to stop at the grocery store on the way home. Oh, I almost forgot; I have to do laundry today. I wonder if I can make it to the gym. On the last day of the month, I have to remember to report my working hours. Oh yeah, I have to log and send in my expenses for the month.”\nThings that need to be done. They don’t get done by standing and staring straight up at the sky in an attempt to make them small enough to disappear.\nBut now and then, we can try to remind ourselves of the emptiness that surrounds all these little musts and problems.

          "description": "A lot of my posts have covered stuff I don't ever have the time of day to talk about. I work too much and almost all of my coworkers are conservative boomers. I don't talk to most of them  much but every once in a while I'll have to share a store with some of them. Sometimes they give me random phone calls. Luckily I have the option of just not picking up the phone.\nI just don't relate with the people I have to interact with on the regular. I mean we aren't having heavy political conversations 24/7 but it just doesn't feel comfortable being around people who you know are the polar opposite of who you are.\nI feel like being able to write about the stuff I never get to talk about is a healthy counterweight to that. I'm not a great writer, I know a lot of the stuff I write won't be read for weeks, or possibly ever. Some of it might be boring or come across cheesy. Sometimes I cover really broad, uninteresting things.\nBut it has had the unexpected effect of making me feel more valid as a person. It feels odd saying that, but it's true.\nMaybe it's because I haven't had a hobby I can get lost in for too long. Making the rounds in different indie web neighborhoods, learning little bits of CSS and bringing my vision to life one piece at a time does a pretty good job at keeping me from getting bored and letting my mind wander to stress. Then when I'm done with that for a while I can write some more. Sometimes I'm proud of it, sometimes I delete it after a couple hours.\nIt feels... healthier than doomscrolling. I prefer this over traditional social media because of the ownership and freedom, and the fact that I sort of get to whisper what I'm saying rather than blasting it over a megaphone and putting myself on stage in front of an audience riding algorithmic dopamine waves.",

I think it’s one of the best ways to find new people to subscribe to, new content to read, and/or new perspectives to be exposed to. However, I don’t have one on my blog. Hypocritical? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just really personal preference.\nI grew up in the days of MySpace, and this irrational want to be included in everyone’s Top 8. Then when you’re in their Top 8, you watch that list like a hawk in case you drop from Top 2 to Top 5, or even worse, drop off altogether. Granted, blogrolls are a bit different since there’s no hard limit on how many can be included (or specified order), but the idea is similar.\nYou see, I’m fine and OK with no…",

Inspired by the great thinkers of the preceding century such as Stirner, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and Spencer, they offered a free-thinking, non-dogmatic alternative to the increasingly powerful Marxists and syndicalists of the left, and the economists and theologians of the right. Importantly, this generation of thinkers developed the critique of the State into a critique of society as a whole, which immunized them from recruitment by the anarchist movement.
