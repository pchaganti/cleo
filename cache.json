          "description": "I spent about a year struggling with GJK back in the 1990s.\nIt's useful for collision detection in 3D, and it can also be used as a closest-points algorithm. As a closest-points algorithm, it's easy to understand the basics. You have two convex solids. Start with a random point on each, and get the distance between those points. On each solid, try to improve the distance by advancing along each edge from the current point. Pick the new closest point. Repeat.\nThis stops working when the closest point is no longer a vertex. That's when the \"simplex\" concept is needed. The closest points can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-edge, edge-face (no unique solution) and face-face (no unique solution). The simplex thing is really doing a case analysis of those cases.\nLots of things go wrong in practice. If you are doing a physics engine, objects will often settle into face-face contact. A single-point collision model will then result in vibration or incorrect movement. Also, as positions settle into face-face contact, the GJK algorithm runs into a small difference of large values problem that can result in a complete loss of floating point significance. \nThe termination condition can also cause infinite looping.\nIn theory, this is an elegant solution, but it's a difficult numerical analysis problem.\nDespite that, it's probably the fastest approach to the problem. It's O(log N) in normal cases, and O(1) for situations where the positions are closest to the previous positions and you use the last solution as the starting point.\nThe late Prof. Steven Cameron at Oxford did a lot of work on getting GJK right.\nI used GJK in \"Falling Bodies\", the first commercial 3D ragdoll system, in the late 1990s.",

VCs will constantly tell you to let it all ride, and sometimes that works out, but for most people, having a little bit of financial security while you’re trying to change the world is necessary.\nThe best startups figure out how to manage liquidity through financing in a way that aligns incentives, keeps the goalposts at the mission, while allowing their teams to thrive.\nIt’s about alignment. If everyone is pulling in the same direction you’re going to execute the vision. Whether you win in the startup lottery is up to the threads of fate, but alignment is the straightest path towards a result.",

When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.\nYour team (and manager) sees you're working\nTough problems need time to solve, and you won't see much meanwhile.

Will I be able to use it on Android? If I no longer have an iPhone will it be a pain to maintain and use?\nA dog cannot serve two masters. A company like Apple doesn't see any of these things as a product. They're a means to an end: to push the iPhone platform (and hardware sales). That priority will always trump the interests of a product like this.\nIt's also why I refuse to buy more into Google products: it's too much of a risk to lose access to everything if Google wakes up one day and decides to suspend your account with no recourse other than making enough of a stink on social media such that an employee will actually look into it.\nPeople don't want everything tied to one identity, one service, one login.",

          "description": "Have to say, I was thoroughly  impressed by what Apple showed today with all this Personal AI stuff. And it proves that the real power of consumer AI will be in the hands of the platform owners where you have most of your digital life in already (Apple or Google for messaging, mail, photos, apps; Microsoft for work and/or life).\nThe way Siri can now perform actions based on context from emails and messages like setting calendar and reservations or asking about someone’s flight is so useful (can’t tell you how many times my brother didn’t bother to check the flight code I sent him via message when he asks me when I’m landing for pickup!).\nI always saw this level of personal intelligence to come about at some point, but I didn’t expect Apple to hit it out of the park so strongly. Benefit of drawing people into their ecosystem.\nNevermind all the thought put into private cloud, integration with ChatGPT, the image generation playground, and Genmoji.  I can genuinely see all this being useful for “the rest of us,” to quote Craig. As someone who’s taken a pessimistic view of Apple software innovation the last several years, I’m amazed.\nOne caveat: the image generation of real people was super uncanny and made me uncomfortable. I would not be happy to receive one of those cold and impersonal, low-effort images as a birthday wish.",

          "description": "I parent a child with autism. The care needs are intense; the burnout is real. But I can't employ usual burnout mitigation techniques like taking time off or making career / lifestyle changes. The world relentlessly marches forward. However, I've learned human resilience is AMAZING. You'll be surprised at what you are capable of when life asks for it.\nHere are a few big insights that have really helped me:\n- You never have to feel like doing something to start doing it. This insight is so strangely freeing. It really got me out of my head and the loop that I was in berating myself about motivation.\n- The act of doing something is usually what creates motivation to continue. Tell yourself you'll spend 30 minutes on whatever it is. No matter what it is, I always know I can survive 30 minutes of it. However, 90% of the time, the timer goes off, but I don't feel like stopping. I've found my grove and I keep going.\n- Procrastination isn't poor time management; it's poor emotional management. Be gentle with yourself. Know that you can be scared, frustrated, or angry but don't have to let those emotions define you. CBT works really well here. Don't define emotions as \"good\" or \"bad\". Define them as \"useful\". If the emotion you feel isn't useful, acknowledge it, but realize it's fleeting and let it pass on. Some people like to visualize emotions as clouds drifting by.\n\"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.\"\n(My grandmother, who survived the Great Depression on a farm, had the Desiderata posted on her wall. https://www.desiderata.com/desiderata.html)",

Last year was the the inaugural event so it was understandably small. This year, it felt smaller and I'm not sure if it's because they didn't advertise enough? There were 2-3 food trucks and a few tables, but that's pretty much it. The bands were lively, and I think we missed some of the performances during the beginning of the day. The event was only 3hrs long, which was also SUPER short. We didn't even bother checking out the mini-petting zoo by the baseball fields.\nIn retrospect, I think it could also be because I'm used to attending big city Pride events, and have higher expectations. I understand that this is a small town event, so maybe this is actually pretty normal.\nAnyways, here are some pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were a lot of dogs there, but of course Cocoa was the only one in a stroller. All the other dogs actually had to walk.\nHoping for a bigger turnout next year.",

          "description": "The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It's like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).\nThis perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.\nOn the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let's say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.\nThinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.",

It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.\nA large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?\nIn Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that \"looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.\" I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do.

I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?\nWeekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.\nBy the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.\nIt's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.\nWhere is that petition for the 4-day work week?\nThis weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",
