This model combines the features of New Keynesian models that have been the workhorse for monetary policy analysis since the work of Woodford (2003) with inequality in wealth and income at the household level following the seminal contribution of Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018). We find that while inflation hurts everyone, it hurts the poor in particular. When the source of inflation is a supply shock, fighting inflation aggressively hurts the poor even more, however, while the opposite is true for demand shocks, as discussed in the companion post.",

          "description": "Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Treasury has issued debt in two main forms: nominal bonds, which provide fixed-cash scheduled payments, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—or TIPS—which provide the holder with inflation-protected payments that rise with U.S. inflation. At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike. After briefly reviewing the theoretical and empirical links between TIPS and Treasury yields, this post, based on a recent research paper, explores whether market perceptions of U.S. sovereign credit risk can help explain the relative valuation of these financial instruments.",

Or maybe it’s just really personal preference.\nI grew up in the days of MySpace, and this irrational want to be included in everyone’s Top 8.

As usual, my phone and computer are set to \"do not disturb\" when I'm writing.\nEven the basic idea itself often comes out of some kind of void: when I'm walking, driving, or eating, for example. Poof! Suddenly something appears, like the characteristic light bulb symbol.\nCreation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.\nThis is what Nikhil writes in the post Get Bored.\nI think it's so well put. That's precisely how it is. Just as a document or canvas needs a blank surface to be used, we, as individuals, need an inner void to make room for creation.\nOur lives are full of excellent opportunities to create these spaces. They're there every day: we're waiting for the elevator, we've stopped at a traffic light, or we're in line at the grocery store. Magnificent opportunities for a moment of “boredom” — an invitation to creativity.\nYour best blog post ever could appear the next time you're on an escalator doing absolutely nothing.\n“Bored to death” is the birth of creativity.",

          "description": "Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.\nBut what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There’s no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there’s no sense of urgency in your mind, there’s calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.\nWhen your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That’s when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.\nProductivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That’s when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.\nWhen you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.",

I would stay, stay and pursue first, permanent residency and then, citizenship.\nWell, after living here, in Quebec, long enough to apply, and sponsored by my partner, I applied to be a permanent resident. A lot of money later after being vetted like I was about to work at Los Alamos in New Mexico, on some Top Secret weapons program or with Aliens, I was finally cleared as being a desirable alien and given residency. Which afforded me certain rights and privileges.\nFrom this point I had to be a resident for at least 3 years before I could then apply to become a citizen. Again, this is not an easy path or a cheap venture let me tell you. And, without the support of a sponsor—in my case, my partner—near on impossible to do. The financial requirement alone, is prohibitive to so many. But, me and mine persisted and finally, in August 2018, I passed the last hurdle in a very long and meticulous process to achieve citizenship. I presented myself to the relevant authorities, made a declaration signed my paperwork and was told I was at that point, barring any further complications, a citizen of Canada.\nThe finishing touch to make it all wholly official came later when, online, with about 100+ other participants, I swore the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, and sang O Canada in Canada's two official languages in front of a judge, online, with my fellow compatriots.\nI was then officially a Canadian citizen. And I have never been more proud of myself, and my partner, at realising a dream.\nAnd here I am, a few years later, on Canada Day, celebrating the fact I am a Canadian.\nHappy Canada Day everyone! 🇨🇦\n1/100",

Because of that, my head is now full of these nonsensical words, and I need to find a way to get them out.\nI've been considering starting 100 days to offload, and I keep giving myself reasons to delay. I've told myself I'd start it in August for my birthday month, or maybe in November of NaBloPoMo (National Blog Posting Month in November), but honestly why wait? There's no better day than today to start, right? (But also because it’s a brand new month.)\nSo I guess here's my official 1st day post. 100 posts in a year. Check back with me in 364 days. I'll let you know how I did (or you can follow along!).\nI'll be tracking my post here, or in my #100daystooffload tag. Come along for the ride — I would love to have you around to (secretly or not so secretly) nudge me and keep me accountable.\nReady, set, go!\n1/100\n🐘 Reply on Mastodon // 📧 Reply by email\nSubscribe via RSS here",

During the summer, when seen from above, it's a verdant, green landscape, with the tops of buildings popping through the canopy.\n\nYes, there's a full city beneath those trees.\nHowever, this is not what the land originally looked like.\nTo cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It's known colloquially as eGoli, or \"The City of Gold\". Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don't have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it's mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.\nThis form of extraction leads to the crushing of millions of tons of ro…",

You get shit done. It's amazing.\nThe close environments of family, friends, and colleagues indeed have the most impact. So I never thought about the overarching environment I was part of, the city, the country. It is only over the past month I have been thinking about it.\nIt started with that famous hit-and-run case in Pune. Not the hit-and-run itself. But the coverup. The systemic failure. The corruption. The stories of this happening often and without any consequence all over the country, all the time.\nThen it was the roof at the airport collapsing and killing a man. It is the traffic here in Bangalore. How no one cares about traffic rules. How the streets just fill up with water every time it rains. The power cuts. There is nothing new to all this. I grew up in India. It was all around me. I just ignored it.\nI feel like I can't ignore it anymore. So the choice is to fix it or to leave. I have tried to fix things in my own way. It made me realise I live in a bubble and the majority of the country is much different from what I am. Or from where I want things to be. It needs a massive culture change.\nTo change it I will need to get political and dedicate my life. I am not willing to get into the shitshow that is politics nor want to dedicate my life to this. I want to do cool things in my life with cool people. And if I feel like the city or the country I live in blocks it. I will move.",

The beauty of Bear Blog is the constraints.

Myths about why and how abuse occurs run rampant and the ones that dominate are ones that ultimately serve in the maintenance of the status quo that keeps victims disempowered and silent.

Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or “anti-state communists,” they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin’s “Anarchism” or “Socialism”, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese’s Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. \n The main gist of the essay is that individuals are not a real mate…",

It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one. \n Anarchism is also a political movement.

The wisdom’s in the trees, not the glass windows”. – Jack Johnson[1]\n A lot of theories have surfaced in the relatively new millennium concerning the human species’ relationship to the planet it calls home. Historically, the mechanized view on nature advocated in the 17th century Scientific Revolution is criticized by ecological movements as alienating humanity from its origins. With the advent of the clock for example, man started measuring time according to its own inventions, exempting the sun of this function.

They mean by this term the intersection of indigenous and Afro-descendant resistances for the recognition of land, against the violence of states, agribusiness, and extractivism. I argue that this case offers key insights to radical geographies, and to the broader field of decolonial scholarship, to challenge cultural and racial essentialisms by connecting different militant traditions. I also argue t…",

The Anarchist Bloc was at actions in Warsaw, Vilnius, Berlin, Tbilisi, Vienna and Zurich. It was important for us to express words of support to people from Ukraine, whose country has been tormented by the Kremlin’s aggression for two years, to applaud the steadfastness of all those who oppose this aggression with weapons in their hands, especially our comrades. \n At the actions we included audio messages from anarchists, who right now are holding…",

According to the regime’s version, they were planning to attack the state infrastructure and sabotage the support of the Russian military in Belarus. The list of the group members includes Maria Misyuk, Trofim Barysau, Sergey Zhigalyou, Dmitry Zahoroshko, Anastasia Klimenka, and Aleksandra Pulinovich.

It would be naive to believe that any action in the controlled environment of the polling stations could affect the percentages displayed on the screens of the Russian empire and the entire planet. Whether you spoil a ballot, write a message on it, or nuke a polling station, Putin will still consistently win. \n Smart voting, apps on phones and even prayers will not be able to influence the results of the vote. \n But that’s not the victory we want to talk about today.
