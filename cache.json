          "description": "This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the \"aliveness\" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label \"life\" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.\nMitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?\nThe implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.",

I'm currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather's got a mood, and it's contagious.\nI love the sound of rain. I think it's soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it's Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.\nMaybe it's just one of those days. I've done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.\nAnd so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don't quite know what to do with just yet.\nThat's all.\n83/100\nComments\n\nIt's snowing in Eastern Canada! ü§©‚ùÑÔ∏è\n-Denis\nIt‚Äôs a wet day here too.

          "description": "My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple's ads for \"Apple Intelligence\" comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly \"save the day\" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.\nThese ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nObviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect \"perfection\" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.",

The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we‚Äôd experience.\nEven as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren‚Äôt allowed to drive.\nAmerica was the place to be. We would get freedom there.\nThat was a long time ago.\nNow, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It‚Äôs no longer the country people dream of coming to.\nToday, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded‚Äîa country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.\nI am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).\nI went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope.
