This doesn’t mean they should get to publish whatever they want, but if a reviewer is about to reject a high profile plugin, they should get a second set of eyes on it. Which would have obviously caught the mistake here.
Feels like another “Firefox is underinvested in developer relations” story, which is surprising given how much they rely on them.
Edit: honestly the idea that gorhill doesn’t have a dedicated rep at Mozilla is baffling to me. According to their stats the extension has 8.4 million users. They should call him on the phone to let him know there’s a problem with his extension.]]></summary>

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.]]></summary>

Cohost was the first place where it felt like, consistently, someone was always reading. Something about the site's design and user culture created a magical space where people approached things with openness and curiosity and willingness to give their time and attention.

Or add "geographic diversity" to get less NYC Jews, or require "well rounded" candidates that do more than pass tests to keep out Asian Americans.

There is this undercurrent to our technology landscape. A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost.  I can only describe it as a live exploration of concepts _through_ technology, where functional fixedness is a foreign concept, including in the shared experience of social construct; everything becomes parts to be remixed in a way.  In this place people just do things that, by way of having fun, just becomes art.  It's emergent gameplay just by following a solitary "rule of cool."
I saw this page and was immediately transported back to the late 1990's and early 'aughts.  The kind of "I glued these things together and just look" attitude that graced the pages of hackaday.com and slashdot.org.  LED "throwies" come to mind.
In this case we have a de-facto art installation.  I imagine that this was probably put together with odds and ends, maybe installed illegally, and probably doesn't have longevity in mind for its construction. It lightheartedly challenges some conventions, challenges ideas about privacy, brushes up against copyright, and is entertaining to boot. Most importantly, how it was made is less interesting than what it _does_, and where it carries the conversation of the observer.  Or maybe: that's the point.]]></summary>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus. Also known as, at this time, the Women's Royal Air Force. Where she became an air traffic controller, as it is also known, air is notoriously difficult to control at any given time of the day or night.]]></summary>

Do you want to present your blogging timeline in a stylish way? Or perhaps have a unique style for your micro thoughts? Or keep a changelog for documenting your blog’s development?
Say hello to the latest cub in the Bearming theme family: Timeline.
Here’s an example with the time-focused timeless song In the Year 2525 (further down the page, you’ll find instructions on how to implement it on your blog):
Year 3535
In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie, everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expectations can play a significant role in driving economic outcomes, with central banks factoring market sentiment into policy decisions and market participants forming their own assumptions about monetary policy. But how well do central banks understand the expectations of market participants—and vice versa? Our model, developed in a recent paper, features a dynamic game between (i) a monetary authority that cannot commit to an inflation target and (ii) a set of market participants that understand the incentives created by that credibility problem. In this post, we describe the game, a type of Keynesian beauty contest: its main novelty is that each side attempts, with varying degrees of accuracy, to forecast the other’s beliefs, resulting in new findings regarding the levels and trajectories of inflation.]]></summary>

Gates over the past four decades.  In the 1980s, Gates was a major player in the falsification of intelligence regarding the Soviet Union, designed to justify unneeded increases in the defense budget.  In 1986, Gates had to withdraw his name from congressional confirmation for the post of director of the Central Intelligence Agency because the majority of the Senate intelligence committee believed he was lying about his role in the infamous Iran-Contra operation.

They sprayed with water guns the blithe holidaymakers seated in restaurants.  Video footage showed unhappy couples and glowering young men chased from their seats by the mob, stunned at the indignity.
The protesters shouted “tourists go home.” They held signs that said “Barcelona is not for sale.” They spoke of “mass touristification” and inveighed against the greed of restaurateurs and hoteliers and Airbnb landlords profiting from the madding crowd while the average Catalan struggled to meet the skyrocketing costs of daily life. One of the protesters told an interviewer, “The city has turned completely for tourists. What we want is a city for citizens.” More

Most books published today have the affect of a book, but the author doesn't really have anything to say. Publishing a book is not about communicating ideas, but a means to something else. It's not meant to stand on its own.

Today, I’m stoked to unveil its new name, inspired by an earlier pseudonym: august morning.
To kick it off, here's a photo taken on an august morning.

The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That's the core of Nihil's philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1967, in the course of the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, the Israeli military razed three Palestinian villages which stood along a corridor connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In keeping with longstanding practice, the Israeli government turned the land over to the Jewish National Fund, which sought to permanently displace the Palestinian villagers through “afforestation,” or redevelopment of the area as a public park, where the former residents would be considered squatters if they tried to return to their homes. To fund the displacement-as-conservation, JNF solicited the Jewish community in Canada, whose contributions also lent the park its name: Canada Park.
Now, more than half a century later, as the Israeli occupation of the West Bank persists amid its ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, JNF’s activities have come under new scrutiny. Most significantly, the Jewish National Fund of Canada has lost its charitable status due to even more outright support for Israeli violence: financing projects for the Israeli military in violation of regulations prohibiting charities from supporting foreign armed forces and activities contrary to public policy, such as illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[America and its origin story are full of unexamined assumptions, one of the biggest being that voters actually cast their ballots for presidential candidates. Is democracy – which comes from the Greek words for people (demos) and rule (kratos) – the USA’s foundational “Big Lie”? Consider that, according to Ari Berman’s new book Minority Rule, only 1.8% of the population of the 13 original states voted in George Washington’s 1789 presidential election. In One Person, One Vote? director Maximina Juson goes behind the closed doors of 1787’s Constitutional Convention, when America’s anti-democratic original sin was enshrined in the new nation’s framed rules, and – like Howard Zinn’s People’s History and Oliver Stone’s Untold History of the United States – reveals hidden truths about “the land of the free.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recognize the author Jascha as an incredibly brilliant ML researcher, formerly at Google  Brain and now at Anthropic.
Among his notable accomplishments, he and coauthors mathematically characterized the propagation of signals through deep neural networks via techniques from physics and statistics (mean field and free probability theory). Leading to arguably some of the most profound yet under-appreciated theoretical and experimental results in ML in the past decade. For example see “dynamical isometry” [1] and the evolution of those ideas which were instrumental in achieving convergence in very deep transformer models [2].
After reading this post and the examples given, in my eyes there is no question that this guy has an extraordinary intuition for optimization, spanning beyond the boundaries of ML and across the fabric of modern society.
We ought to recognize his technical background and raise this discussion above quibbles about semantics and definitions.
Let’s address the heart of his message, the very human and empathetic call to action that stands in the shadow of rapid technological progress:
> If you are a scientist looking for research ideas which are pro-social, and have the potential to create a whole new field, you should consider building formal (mathematical) bridges between results on overfitting in machine learning, and problems in economics, political science, management science, operations research, and elsewhere.

If you get left behind on an island because your ride wasn't safe and another boat picks you up, is that a rescue? Now what if you're 420 kilometers up and another boat has to come get you. Is that a rescue?
If there wasn't another ride from the ISS available, would the astronauts be stranded? Yes.

There's a scene where the male lead, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), was putting googly eyes all over the lanterns and doing a sneaky shush at the camera before running away.
"Oh, that's [deadname]," said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.
Eh? That's me?
I'll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my "I have to be a man" phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It's very easy to read it that way because Waymond's character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead.

Do you sometimes hear that? I think it's such an incredibly stupid thing to say. If you were me, which you clearly aren't, then you would do something that I, as myself, wouldn’t do.
It's just a way of expressing oneself, someone might think. I beg to differ.
My feeling is that the person who expresses themselves in that way has a lot of their own issues that should be addressed. Instead of doing that, they get a momentary, false sense of "I got my shit together" by explaining what others should do.
Do you want to share your own experiences? Please do, I love listening to that. Do you have specific advice to give? Bring it on, and I'll take what applies to who I am here and now.

The only problem was that I didn't think that anything I was doing was very exciting, so I quickly stopped doing it. I've tried since to make several paid sites that focus on my reading and writing book reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's from my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic when they can actually see you hurting. For the millionth time in my life, I wished depression manifested like the flu or some other recognizable disease, just to make it simple for me and for the people around me.
How much easier would it be if mental illness were physical - visible and tangible? A runny nose and a sore throat - people would understand. They would offer me tissues, a warm cup of tea, and a sympathetic get well soon. But a shitty compilation of mental symptoms and an even shittier chemical make up? How do I explain an intangible pain?
What can I say, anyway? Sometimes I feel like I am carrying around a heavy suitcase full of sadness everywhere that I go. The smallest task feels impossible. Everything is dull yet heavy, all at once.  Everything matters too much yet nothing matters. Anything would be easier to explain than what's really going on.
I think this topic further resonates with me as someone with high-functioning depression. I recall an attempt to open up about my state with a close friend, who reacted with amusement and disbelief, as if I was exchanging lighthearted banter. But you are so put together, Tala. You are successful, ace tests, and excel at work - it must be a misdiagnosis.
I was overwhelmed with shame that later transformed into rage. I found it impossible to articulate the depth of pain - that yes, I am waking up everyday, leaving bed, fulfilling my obligations. But I am still struggling, still fighting a relentless battle with the energy I have left.
And there are millions of us suffering a silent, invisible battle against our mental illnesses, while we present a facade of normalcy to world. Because sometimes silence is the easier option.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These sorts of articles raise so many thoughts and emotions in me.  I was trained as a computational biologist with a little lab work and ran gels from time to time.  Personally, I hated gels- they're finicky, messy, ugly, and don't really tell you very much.  But molecular biology as a field runs on gels- it's the priimary source of results for almost everything in molbio.  I have seen more talks and papers that rested entirely a single image of a gel which is really just some dark bands.
At the same time, I was a failed scientist: my gels weren't as interesting, or convincing compared to the ones done by the folks who went on to be more successful.  At the time (20+ years ago) it didn't occur to me that anybody would intentionally modify images of gels to promote the results they claimed, although I did assume that folks didn't do a good job of organizing their data, and occasionally published papers that were wrong simply because they confused two images.
Would I have been more successful if fewer people (and I now believe this is a common occurrence) published fraudulent images of gels?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the more important thing is that everybody just went along with this.  I participated in many journal clubs where folks would just flip to Figure 3, assume the gel was what the authors claimed, and proceed to agree with (or disagree with) the results and conclusions uncritically.  Whereas I would spend a lot of time trying to understand what experiment was actually run, and what th e data showed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am always glad to see people pursuing creating their own programming language. More people should give it a try, IMHO.
A tricky thing that comes up with Rust comparisons is that often, Rust has a feature that's weird or hard to use, but it's because that's the only solution that makes sense within the constraints Rust has placed upon itself. Clicking some links gets me to https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/src/branch/master/docs/yao/de...
> Yao's biggest goals are: Correctness, Convenience, Performance, in that order.
Having clear goals is a great thing when making a language, because they give you guidance on what is appropriate to include and what is not.
Rust has certainly demonstrated having similar goals, but in a slightly different order: Correctness, Performance, and then Convenience. So it wouldn't shock me if Yao could do some things better than Rust, in accordance with its goals. But that also means that sometimes, Rust would be useful where Yao cannot be. Everything is tradeoffs.
Incidentally, I actually think that figuring out what your values are, and what your needs are, is a great way to pick a programming language. Decide what matters to you as an engineer, and then find a language that shares similar values. I gave a conference talk a few years back on this idea, and how I viewed Rust's values at the time https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-tradeoffs/
This was based off of bcantrill's Platform as a Reflection of Values, which was very influential on me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhx970_JKX4
If you've ever heard about Oxide's focus on values, this is some of the older background on that.]]></summary>

Their favorite family trip so far?  When we traveled to Arkansas to mine for crystals.  AKA, dig in the dirt all day.  They saw it on a YouTube video. They asked to go.  So we obliged. I had never been to Arkansas.  It's beautiful.

PR and ad culture was there to support that. The goal was to change values and behaviours to get people to Buy More Stuff. OK.

Now, I'm not going to criticize anyone that does it, like I said, you have to, that's it.

Gambling wasn't seriously problematic in this country until 2005, when regulations were substantially liberalised. Pre-2005, sports betting was something that old men did in dingy backstreet shops; post-2005, it became a widespread social phenomenon, turbocharged by advertising and the growing influence and accessibility of the internet.
There's a false dichotomy between prohibition and laissez-faire, which the US seems particularly prone to. You've seen similar issues with the decriminalisation of cannabis, where many states seem to have switched abruptly from criminalisation to a fully-fledged commercial market. There is a broad spectrum of other options in between those points that tend to be under-discussed.
You can ban gambling advertising, as Italy did in 2019. You can set limits on maximum stakes or impose regulations to make gambling products less attractive to new customers and less risky for problem gamblers. You can have a single state-controlled parimutuel operator. Gambling does cause harm - whether it's legal or not - but it is within the purview of legislators to create a gambling market in which harm reduction is the main priority.]]></summary>

Immigration. A nation of immigrants, with dying main streets, empty classrooms, and labor shortages in key industries, is about to cast its votes based in large part on which candidate can best be trusted to reduce rates of both legal and illegal immigration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports gambling, like all gambling, ruins lives. It's certainly worth having the discussion about whether people should be able to run a train through their life and the lives of their families via app.
But a much easier argument against sports betting is that it ruins the sports. Players throw. They get good at subtly cheating. The gambling apparatus latches itself to the sport, to the teams and players, the umpires and judges, the sporting organizations. With this much money on the line, it's not a matter of if but when games are thrown, cheated -- the bigger the game, the bigger the incentive. It's even easier now because of the amount of side/parlay betting that is available. It exhausts the spirit of competition.
Sports gambling is diametrically opposed to sport itself.]]></summary>

There are surely loads of artists and independent technical authors who got screwed by it which I am not diminishing, but this is more than dwarfed by the benefit to the hundred of millions around the world especially from developing countries who can't afford to pay $100+ for a textbook on essential topic like organic chemistry or electrical engineering.
