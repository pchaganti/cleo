        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Java has evolved significantly since the release of Java 8 in 2014. Java 17, released in 2021, brings a host of new features and improvements that can enhance your code's readability, maintainability, and performance. This article will guide you through the key features introduced between Java 8 and Java 17, providing examples of how to migrate your code to take advantage of these new capabilities.
Sealed Classes
Java 17 introduces sealed classes, a powerful feature that enhances Java's object-oriented programming model and works seamlessly with pattern matching in switch expressions.
New Syntax:
The sealed keyword declares a sealed class or interface, and the permits clause specifies allowed subclasses:
public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle { }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[it’s kind of odd how good i’ve been doing lately; almost scary, even. i think i’ve spent most of my existence being kind of miserable, which in hindsight feels a little bit like a waste. i’ve dealt with plenty of sad and complicated situations (for a lot longer than i should have, really) throughout my life that have made most of my time on this earth leave something to be desired. even when things were going pretty alright externally, internally i always felt like there was this vague feeling of sadness looming over me—like maybe i didn't really deserve to be completely happy. at best, i was always just okay and nothing better.
but not this time…?
i think i can say i’m actually in a pretty good spot right now and it’s really weird being able to say so. it’s something i’m struggling to believe, even though i know it’s true. of course there are still some devils i don't really want to tango with yet, but i'll cross that bridge when i get there. for now, i'm having fun.
genuine contentment is an uncomfortable feeling but it’s very much welcome to stay for as long as it’d like. i hope you've been doing good too.
until next time!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I take inspiration from everything and everyone.
People- First of all, I don't know if I would be writing this without my brother, Arun. He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I've learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.
The war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I've read not because of it's writing but because if it's relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.
Brandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It's such a perfect series. Then there's the Stormlight Archive and it's huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).
Haikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It's about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.
It just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it's all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.
Naval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you've been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He's everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.]]></summary>

Title: The left of capital is sabotaging the anarchist movement: let’s fight back!

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I don't know... Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I've already failed?), seriously.
I'm a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I'm failing more.
I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I coul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heard there was a heatwave going on across the country right now.
I spent quite a few years in the Middle East (in my namesake city) where heat is the norm. I grew up in the East Coast (of the US), where we had 4 seasons, and summers were hot and humid. Now, living in a specific part of the West Coast where summers rarely hit above 70F/21.1C (and rarely humid), we are in our own little cocoon. Like right now, it’s 66F/18.89C (1:52pm).
I’ve been sensitive to temperature (and weather changes in general) for as long as I can remember. High temperatures and barometric pressure changes are two big migraine triggers. So if it’s too hot, raining, or humid… chances are, I’ll be out of commission, or least somewhat more miserable than an average person.
I didn’t know much about San Francisco (and Bay Area in general) prior to moving here 5+ years ago. I think in some ways, I just got lucky. I have a love/hate relationship with this city (more on that later), but in some ways, I think this is where I’m meant to be.
You see…it doesn’t rain here often. We have our rainy season end of the year / a few months into the new year, but that’s pretty much it. In the areas I’ve lived in (and currently live in), it rarely gets hot. The more inland you go, the hotter it could get. Thankfully, the area we are in only gets hot a few weeks in the year. It saves me from suffering too often due to high temperatures.
And so, I’m sending cooling vibes and energy to all those melting in other parts of the country right now. We’ll hit 77F/25C this weekend, and 80F/26.67C at some point next week. Although it may seem mild to many, it’s not something my body is accustomed to anymore.
Anyways, please don’t hate me for writing this. I feel for those struggling right now with the heat, and I really do wish I could share a little bit of our cooling breeze your way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had a nostalgic moment in my exam hall. It was so quiet except for the sound of the ceiling fan and people's footsteps outside. I was looking at the wall clock 45 minutes into my exam (that's what I do in exam halls). This particular time, it brought back memories of my childhood (like in 5th or 6th grade) when I used to play Monopoly with my friends during power cuts.
Another memory that recently surfaced depicted my school at 3:30 PM when classes would be over, and there would be clamoring in the corridor until we went to the parking lot. This was triggered by people chatting in front of the exam halls. There is a certain comfort in these noises.
Savor these moments when they happen, but don't be jailed by them. Remember, time is a cruel mistress who will make you forget the struggles and just remember the good parts.
It's like what Andy says in The Office: "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them."]]></summary>

I've always loved the vintage aesthetic, but have been more drawn to it recently. Been loving this little area in the MOM & POP art shop in downtown Point Richmond (CA). We've gotten a few pins and a record (or 2) here in the past.
Here are some of my favorite snapshots...





And then some more finds around the area...
In case you didn't know, I have a thing for photographing old school pay phones.

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning.

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides.

The walls were decorated with plants and art. One of the pictures caught my eye. It said:
Always be a little kinder than necessary.
Wise words! And so simple. A free gesture that can brighten someone's day.
A little smile. A thumbs up. A "tell the chef the food was delicious".
We don't need to exaggerate. We don't have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.
But we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.
If we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.

Title: On Eugene O’Neill’s “Philosophical Anarchism”
Date: 2007
Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/29784831>

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…]]></summary>

In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.]]></summary>

Title: On Organization
Date: 1954
Notes: Translated from the Italian-language article in ‘L’Adunata dei Refrattari’, June 19, 1954, New York City and Newark. A partial English translation previously appeared in ‘Resistance: An Anarchist Bi-Monthly‘, August-October 1954, New York City, but this is a new and complete translation

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…]]></summary>

Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.
