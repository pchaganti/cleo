Four of them are done and on their way to their forever homes to be read and tucked away in books, to be pinned on a fridge or placed on a shelf perhaps. Tiny paper notes traveling across the globe.

finished postcards...can you guess which one is yours?

Things Seen by Annie Ernaux
my fanciful summer wishlist:
reading print magazines/books
sending handwritten postcards and letters
handmade bed quilt > duvet
playing cards by candlelight
more candles and boxes of matches
going to a drive-in (i've never been)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn't gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I'm so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I'd make my own version of it
Here's my anti-resume,
I don't specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I write code because its fun. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That's it for now :)]]></summary>

Disclaimer: I am not a fan of gambling. I do not condone it. I do not recommend it. In fact, I believe online gambling and sports betting will irrevocably damage entire generations. I was terribly addicted and it really gave me bad thoughts all the time. Do not, do not gamble.
With that being said, I used to gamble, a lot. I started really young: when I was 11. It began innocuously with Team Fortress 2, betting in-game currencies like refined metals in raffle groups for larger prizes. I was on the edge of my seat for pennies. I never told my parents (hint: my family was poor). While this wasn't particularly profitable, it was my introduction to the habit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in early 2016 I had a medical emergency I never saw coming and had something happen to me that resulted in my having to take early retirement. Though I am thankful it wasn't permanent retirement to the grave.
The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can't say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…]]></summary>

Title: Letters of Insurgents
Date: 1976
Notes: Published by Black and Red Press, Detroit, 1976.

Yarostan’s first letter
 Dear Sophia, 
 Forgive me for addressing you familiarly, as a friend; I have no way of knowing if you’re still the person I once knew. I can’t remember the sound of your voice, the shape of your face or the feel of your hand. I vaguely remember admiring the energy and intelligence in someone so young, but I regret that you didn’t leave a lasting mark, you didn’t become my guide in my journey through hell. 
 I wouldn’t even remember your name if you hadn’t written me twelve years ago. My wife Mirna memorized the name and address on the envelope because she attributed a strange power to your letter. Unfortunately I never saw that…]]></summary>

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It's citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers' losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).
Similarly, CMU students are driven not by dreams of passion o…]]></summary>

 It was the early spring of 2017, and I stood in line for the daily school routine. We did the usual routine of standing up for the Palestinian anthem and the obligatory start-of-the-week fingernail check. The inspector will hit your hands with a wooden stick if you do not cut your fingernails every week. After the morning routine, we saw our sports teacher make an announcement:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It's a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.



Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let's call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There's more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Video
Here's a two minute video on how to add commenting to a Bear blog post.
Give it a go
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it's completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.
I'm happy to help, if you are not sure how to set it up.  Email david@komments.cloud
