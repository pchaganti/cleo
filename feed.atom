        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> "I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read."
This is now to me the "old school" internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don't blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly "Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?"
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it's been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don't participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these "professional" creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.]]></summary>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary dream…]]></summary>

DJ: What is Anarchism? 
JZ: I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination. This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn't really my choice; the doctor said that they could "try to do some creative billing," but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i'm away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i'm living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i've met so many wonderful friends. i've lost a few. i've bought a car. i've gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i've had more than a few mental health episodes... i've also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i've learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what'll happen in the next five!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.
I don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.
I have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.
this isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.
I don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?
but it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.
do what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.
on my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I could be wrong; I've been wrong once before."
A former coworker of mine used to say this. Of course, he said it as a joke, but it's also a classic example of 'it's funny because it's true'.
No one would seriously express themselves this way, but it seems to be the attitude many people harbor. I was reminded of this when I read Manuel Moreale's great post, It should be easy to say "My bad, I was wrong". He writes:
Saying "I was wrong" is a sign you're willing to get better and improve.
So true! Making mistakes and being wrong is part of life's learning curve, from the moment we take our first stumbling steps. We learn, develop, and move forward with newfound knowledge and wisdom.
But it's as if our delicate little egos, built on something as fragile as always being right, are afraid of perishing if they admit to being wrong. It's not only a fragile existence but also a very foolish attitude.
Often, when we make mistakes, it's partly because someone else taught us wrong from the beginning. So, it's not just our own ego we're trying to protect but others as well. An impossible mission where the only thing that will self-destruct is ourselves.
Admitting that we were wrong is not only the right thing to do. It's also significantly easier than fighting for the right to "be right."
Let's all do the right thing when we're wrong by simply saying:
Sorry, I was wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafax
We're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).
Problem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of "de-NVIDIAfying" that needs to be done.
Solution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.
Our strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1676 Roemer estimated the speed of light by timing the orbit of Jupiter’s moon Io, noting that as the Earth approached Jupiter, Io emerged from behind Jupiter a little earlier every day, and as the Earth traveled away from Jupiter it appeared a little later every day, with the time of day varying by 22 minutes over a year. Knowing the difference between the two distances, he reckoned that light travels that distance in 22 minutes, or 227 thousand km/s. The actual speed is about 300 thousand km/s. Not bad!]]></summary>

It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.

My darkest moment in life occurred about five years ago. For a long time, I understood that something wasn't right, but refused to accept it — both for those around me and for myself.
"I'm handling this myself! I won’t let anyone think there’s something wrong with me, ever. I got this!"
I tried weight training, yoga, meditation, running, seeking spirituality, reading books, attending online events, going on retreats…

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it's because i need to promote something or i'm reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don't like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn't; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed "posting" on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr's design the most) so i'm unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i'll ask them. if i'm gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i'll message them instead of posting into the void.
it's all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don't know what's going on because you're shouting into the void and they're not in it, but you don't actively talk to them because there's this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i'm pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i'm looking forward to never thinking about social media again.]]></summary>

In fact, that's the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone's site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).
There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content.

Title: Anarchy is Love
Date: Summer 2024
Source: Dope 26

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…]]></summary>

Title: The Making of the Spanish CNT-IWA (2010–2024)
Date: September 21, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 23rd September 2024 from libcom.org

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside. This (rather incomplete) article resumes the story of that conflict as seen through the eyes of what is now the CNT (CIT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).]]></summary>

This add-on for the Bearming theme allows you to include buttons for emailing, printing, and sharing your blog posts on social media (see examples at the bottom of this page).
To use the add-on, which requires the latest version of the Bearming theme (1.3), add the code below to the end of your posts. If you prefer to avoid adding it manually each time, paste the code into your post template (Bear dashboard -> Posts -> Edit template).
<ul class="share">
<li><a href="mailto:?subject={{ post_title }}&body=Hey there,%0D%0A%0D%0AI saw this post and thought you might like it:%0D%0A{{ post_link }}"><span class="material-icons">mail</span> Email</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url={{ post_link }}&title={{ post_title }}" target="_blank"> <span class="material-icons">share</span> Share</a></li>
</ul>

Then add the following style to your theme:
/* Share buttons */
.share {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);

Granted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don't have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I've been to a few really enjoy…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s nothing wrong with listening to podcasts and audiobooks. There’s a ton of great content out there. The problem is the amount I consume.
Most of what I listen to falls under the productivity/self-improvement category, things you'd classify as "good content." And in moderation, it can be helpful. Who doesn’t want to improve their life?
But I suck at moderation. I listen to back-to-back episodes, not giving myself time to process what I've heard. Hours of opinions and advice that rarely result in meaningful life change.
The constant audio stream prevents me from letting my mind wander. My thoughts are crowded out, and my attention is divided, making it difficult to fully engage with the present moment.
This weekend, I put my headphones away. I wanted to see how I felt without the distraction.
At first, it was uncomfortable because I have a habit of always listening to something. But after a few days, I appreciated times of silence. I felt more relaxed.
From now on, I want to be more intentional about how much content I consume. I could limit myself to one episode of a podcast or one chapter of an audiobook.
More doesn't necessarily mean better. You can only absorb so much in one day, and at a certain point, there are diminishing returns. Often, a slow and steady approach works best.

Engineers should get the time to “sand” their products, but we just don’t. If QA doesn’t make a ticket for the space between, it’ll never get fixed.
The customer probably notices this kind of a thing but it’s a miracle if the customer bothers to report it, and another miracle if it eventually turns into a ticket, and another miracle if someone prioritises it enough to spend time fixing it.
[In fact most companies have such opaque issue boards that as a customer I get so frustrated when I find a small issue or bug and have to spend like 50 hours back and forth to prove it’s a bug and actually get a ticket put in the tracker.]]]></summary>

All of the important characters could be handled in just a few bits (7 or 8) and low resolution in Western markets, with different fonts and character maps dropped in to support a few different alphabets.
But in CJK countries, things were much harder and the entire I/O system had to be significantly more capable than what might pass for usable elsewhere. This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time. A common add-on was ROMs with Kanji (Chinese derived characters) support in the same way a person in the West might buy a …]]></summary>

(note: this post is image-heavy)
I bought a new camera this week. Or, at least, a refurbished one, purchased on impulse as part of a mad scramble to fill my life with things to do that don't involve looking at a computer.
This isn't my first flirtation with photography. A brief obsession with the fantastic Umurangi Generation pushed me to pick up a cheap Centon df300 a few years back. I love film, I really do; the warm texture of shots, the ritual of getting it developed, the unpredictability of how things will turn out. But between the cost and time it took to see the results and the technical fussiness of keeping a decades-old handheld working, I slowly began to fall off.

Title: Anarchism, anthropology and Andalucia
Subtitle: An analysis of the CNT and the ‘new capitalism’

ABSTRACT
 Systems theory can show us how organizations develop, allowing them to survive changes in their environments. Such analyses also demonstrate why the CNT is passing through such a profound crisis: it is a trade union which is completely excluded from the world of work. The CNT began in a society very different from today. Despite the many significant changes which have occurred since 1910, its organizational structures and ideological assumptions have remained practically unchanged.

 We have allowed the American ruling class[1]to abstract themselves almost entirely from their substantive political positions and practices. So deeply engrossed are we in their branding as products of consumption, in their spectacular representations, that we seem to have no capacity to grapple critically with the situation we find ourselves in. The moment calls for careful reengagement with French philosopher Guy Debord’s book The Society of the Spectacle, as well as one of its most important, if unsung, precursors, German philosopher (perhaps anti-philosopher) …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m finding myself falling into this habit of reading blog posts that resonate with me, with full intention of writing a response post for it, and never actually doing it.
Half the time, it’s because I answer it in my head, and forget that I didn’t actually answer it out loud (or in this case, via a blog post).
I do this often. Not just for blog posts.
If I’ve ever left you on Read1, it's (mostly) not because I am ignoring you. Most of the time, I respond in my head, exit out of the message, and completely forget about it. This can happen for text or email.
It's not you, it's me.
Sometimes, I just get really overwhelmed and may take me some time to respond. Again, it's me, not you.
Anyways, back to the blog posts.
I've been reading a ton of blog posts that I've wanted to reply to. Or mostly to spin off my own Reply post to it. I think I've only done one response post because I keep forgetting to physically write it down on my to-do list to start.
Essentially this is just a reminder to myself that I'd still like to do that. And to stop forgetting.
That's all. Maybe it can be a reminder for you too.
