Over the course of the week, the Democratic Party elite rubbed elbows and egos at the United Center and the McCormick Place Convention Center while outside, thousands gathered for meetings and marches, demonstrations and disruptions. CounterPunch Radio co-host and worker-owner at Chicago's Pilsen Community Books, Erik Wallenberg, captured voices in the streets and Nathaniel St. Clair produced the episode.
We hear from leaders of the opposition including Cornel West and Medea Benjamin as well as protesters who organized against the 1968 DNC and came out in the streets this year too. A speech from Chicago for Abortion Rights leader Mandy Medley, music from Songs for Liberation, and words from Mennonites for Ceasefire ring out alongside members of Jewish Voice for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine, and Veterans Against the War. The episode closes out with a song, Fields of Palestine, which was performed by Ryan Cason, a member of Songs for Liberation and Irish Americans for Palestine. They adapted the Irish folk song, Fields of Athenry in solidarity with the struggle in Palestine. More

 If, for any number of reasons, you’d like to burn telecoms to the ground and build a new internet service provider on their smoldering remains, good news for you. New York City Spectrum workers, who’ve weathered an anguishing four-year strike, have built their own internet service provider. If the city throws its support behind it, People’s Choice Communications could liberate New Yorkers from cable gangsters once and for all. 
 The city itself is almost constantly fighting Spectrum. With its rise to dominance in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tried to evict it; attorneys general had to chase it around for allegedly defrauding…]]></summary>

 My name is Kostya, I am a student of the second grade. [Kostya lives in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine.] 
How did you experience the beginning of the war?
 In fact, I sensed that a full-scale invasion would soon occur, but I did not expect it to be so large and destructive. I remember the beginning very well. My mother asked me to buy food, which was practically non-existent, and told me to stay at home. The first week was very scary, nobody knew what was going to happen.

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …]]></summary>

I was managing a small optics factory in Livermore. We made laser mirrors to order there — any wavelength, any reflectivity, any angle, any polarization, you name it. I was working my ass off and was unmarried at the time. Thanksgiving came around and I had nowhere to go. But I hooked up with a church in San Jose that had a dinner for poor people and went as a volunteer. After serving the dinner, I wandered back into the dish room. I immediately went over to the sink and kicked out the lady who was pretending to work. I then washed all the dishes and left.
Comes one year later.  I’m in the exact same situation.  I call up that church.  The lady says, “Oh, that’s very nice of you.  But we don’t need any more volunteers, we have enough.”  Oh shit.  What to do.  I found my old replica army parka I had bought in a Cambridge surplus store 20 years earlier. I went as a poor person. I didn’t want to be alone.
The first thing I found out is that poor people are herded, controlled, treated like children. We had to wait outside the church in the mild cold until permitted to enter, in a kind of line. So I sit down.  I will never forget the beatific smiles of the volunteers that served us.  This was performance art, and they were the stars.  Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this, I’m sure. So the meal ends. I walk back into the dish room, survey the situation, once again kick out whoever was pretending to do the dishes, do the dishes, and leave.]]></summary>

Today marks the first anniversary of your passing. Not a day goes... eeh, what’s that you said?
"I know, you don't have to rub it in."
Haha! Your sense of humor is intact. That's still one of the first things people mention when your name comes up: your wonderful sense of humor, and how incredibly kind you were.
You truly treated everyone with the same care and respect.
I still remember the incident in the garden from when I was little. A drug addict had wandered in and fallen asleep there. Mom and all of us kids stood at a safe distance, nervously watching as you helped him. Before staggering off, he turned around with tears of gratitude and asked:
"Are you a priest?"
That’s the kind of person you were. A helping hand and a life saver. A true hero.
As you know, your other son turns 50 today. But this day is not about birth or death. It’s a day of celebration and love. A day of unity, no matter the realm of residence.
Thank you for the long and wonderful time you gave us. Thank you for all the lovely memories that keep your spirit alive. Thank you for all the beautiful things you passed on to us.
I'll end with your last words:
I love you!]]></summary>

I’ve had a really good few days (since Friday) break. We did a lot in a relatively short amount of time.
So many indicators of a memorable time.
Tan lines in random places to indicate getting that much needed Vitamin D.
Photographs that froze time to be remembered and printed.
(Enamel) Pins added to my collection of places visited.
Stickers. All of the stickers, even though pins have replaced that obsession.
A couple of library cards to show that even during vacation, I still think about all of the books to be read in the future.
Memories of full bellies because we ate a lot of really yummy food.
I’m still processing everything. I’ll be posting all of the photos in the future, whether it be on here, or on the photoblog.
Last day of my very short “vacation” today.
I woke up this morning after having dreamt of work, with tears in my eyes. Is it respectable for me to throw a tantrum to show that I really don’t want to go back to work tomorrow?
Probably not. For today, I’m going to try really hard to just not think about it.
Vacation is not over until it’s over.

To temper this a bit, you may want to pay close attention to the demo videos. The player rarely backtracks, and for good reason - the few times the character does turn around and look back at something a second time, it has changed significantly (the most noticeable I think is the room with the grey wall and triangle sign).
This falls in line with how we'd expect a diffusion model to behave - it's trained on many billions of frames of gameplay, so it's very good at generating a plausible -next- frame of gameplay based on some previous frames. But it doesn't deeply understand logical gameplay constraints, like remembering level geometry.]]></summary>

Things evolved a lot over the years. Mono's legacy goals, which are to be a portable CLR (.NET) runtime for platforms that Microsoft didn't care about, don't make much sense today.
Mono made a lot of sense for running places where full .NET didn't, like in full AOT environments like on the iPhone where you can't JIT, or for random architectures that don't matter anymore but once did for Linux (Alpha, Itanium, PPC, MIPs, etc.). When Microsoft bought Xamarin (which itself was born out of the ashes of the Novell shutdown of the Mono effort) and started the DotNET Core efforts to make .NET more portable itself and less a system-provided framework and merge in a lot of the stuff Mono did a single more focused project made more sense.
Mono was still left out there to support the edge cases where DotNET Core didn't make sense, which was mostly things like being a backend for Wine stuff in some cases, some GNOME Desktop stuff (via GTK#, which is pretty dead now), and older niche use cases (second life and Unity still embed mono as a runtime for their systems). The project was limping, though, and sharing a standard library but different runtimes after much merging. Mono's runtime was always a little more portable (C instead of C++) and more accessible to experiment with, but we need that less and less, but it's still perfect for Wine. So, having it live on in Wine makes sense. It's a natural fit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a lot. Probably more than a lot of people, but still not as much as some.
When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it's just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less growing up. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn't unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven't heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library's entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with a local library card to start with. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I'm a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards = even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.

People in the first world take having fun very seriously. We sure spend enough money on it. Some kinds of fun are pricing themselves out of the middle-class range. Tickets and all that goes with them (parking, food, souvenirs) to major league sports and top-tier concerts can easily take a family outing into four figures. A day at a Disney theme park for a family of four is well over $1000.
I've never been to a Disney Park, and my last concert was 15 years ago. I guess I'll die without seeing Bruce Springsteen. I heard the other day that he's reached billionaire status, and I'm not giving a billionaire any of my dough to be entertained for three hours, no matter how good a showman he is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what you’re thinking:
“Not another blog challenge!”
But hear me out...
There’s been a debate lately about the existence or non-existence of blog challenges. The criticism has been that quantity takes precedence over quality. Even though there haven’t been any requirements for daily posts, it’s sort of become the norm to post every day.
With that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A "challenge" where quality comes first – and only.
The idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your "best" during the month.
The post that...
...you are most proud of.
...was the hardest to write.
...is the most personal.
...best represents you.
...made you think in new ways.
Or whatever you base "best" on. Your favorite, simply put.
Why this challenge?
As a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.
If you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.
Please note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.

I'm constantly evaluating whether I feel good enough and if not, what I can do to rectify that situation. Do I need a snack? Maybe some cell phone time is called for. Maybe I am working too hard, and I need a break. Are people treating me with enough respect? Are my co-workers doing their fair share of tasks? Are raises coming up? Will I get what I deserve?
If I had the power to do one thing to my worst enemy, I would make that bastard as self-centered as possible, because brothers and sisters, let me tell you, a self-centered existence is a miserable existence. Until I was 43, the answer to the internal question "Do I feel good enough?" was…]]></summary>

A manager _can_ contact an employee on a Sunday, but then the employee is immediately on weekend-rate overtime even if they just got an email with "deal with this next week". So, many companies have systems that hold back e-mail sent outside of working hours until the next working day unless specially authorised and costed.
Never underestimate an economics-based solution to a legal problem, a.k.a. "if you really want to ban it, tax it".]]></summary>

> Visitors who didn't see the calculator were 16% more likely to sign up and 90% more likely to contact us than those who saw it. There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.
Of course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That's not something you will figure out from a short-term A/B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.
I see this dynamic frequently with A/B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A/B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through. The question of which is actually better seemed to have been totally forgotten.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've dabbled in management a few times in my career. This meant attending manager-only meetings and trainings. I'll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, "The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they'll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else." This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.
After I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I'd need to be "one of them." I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.
I know not every manager is like that. I'd like to think I wasn't. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.
The Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.
The report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.
Indeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he'd done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! We're engineers/designers from France, and we've built the Ultimate DIY Battery that you can repair and refill!
It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike?
We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence!
Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it:
- What is the Gouach Battery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsuW1NPkvNk
- Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLoCihE0eIA
- Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDJpt7RDbRM
Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com
We'd love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community
Oh, and it's launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You just have to double check the results whenever you tell Claude to extract lists and data.
99.9% of it will be correct, but sometimes 1 or 2 records are off. This kind of error  is especially hard to notice because  you're so impressed that Claude managed to do the extract task at all --  plus the results look wholly plausible upon eyeballing -- that you wouldn't expect anything to be wrong at all.
But LLMs can get things ever slightly wrong when it comes to long lists/tables. I've been bitten by this before.
Trust but verify.
(edit: if the answer is "machine verifiable", one approach  to ask an LLM to write a Python validator which it can execute internally. ChatGPT can execute code. I believe Sonnet 3.5 can too, but I haven't tried.)]]></summary>

It's a ton of work, especially with the number of systems - you've got combat, resource management, settlement development, food managment, espionage, diplomacy etc - these all need to play together well. And then you've got to add in the storyline, graphics, marketing -but I think I'm making pretty good progress.
I'm still using Unreal Engine 4 because I started work on that version and I haven't needed to upgrade to 5 since it's been released.
I've got a free prologue that I'm releasing on October 1, so now until then is a lot of polishing to make it work well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.
As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.
Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.
And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.
Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.]]></summary>

All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let's give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn't much to a determined spammer, but I didn't want to be…]]></summary>

Every day I tell myself the same thing: “You’ll feel much better if you do!” And it’s true! I don’t know of any tonic that’s as good for my mood, energy, and mental health as a solid hour of writing in the morning before life starts. It feels like a luxury, really, having the time to do this, and I’m grateful. It’s just me, the sunrise, my dog sitting next to me, and the sound of the pen as it scratches meaning on paper, echoing in the silent dining room.

 “Anarchism is still the most beautiful ideal, and I think someday it will come,” wrote Lau Chung-Si (Ray Jones) from a small apartment in San Francisco. At the time he put these words to paper in 1974, he was a relic of another time. Jones was a Chinese man who, in 1909, immigrated to the United States and quickly became enamoured with the ideas of anarchism. He was involved in a collective of Chinese American anarchists in San Francisco named Pingsheh (Equality Society). He also attended meetings held by ot…]]></summary>
