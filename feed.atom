Things seemed fine in the beginning. The instructors were good, and I liked that there were actual live classes. Things degraded very quickly. They kept changing the format and the curriculum ("iterating"). They doubled the length of the program that I was in, which made it impossible for me to even finish it. I was working in a tech support job where we had to do shift bids and no shift was guaranteed. I enrolled in a plan that fit the shift I was working, and the expected end date, and when they changed the program length and format, I couldn't complete it.
They promised career guidance, including having a career councilor, but I never got one. They kept telling my cohort we would get our councilors after this or that milestone, but when we got there they would move the goalpost again. The closest we got was a resume course that was not relevant to tech at all and a resume review by another student.
When I had to drop out of the program, I tried to get them to cancel the ISA or reduce it, but they said I had completed "most" of the curriculum and thus was on the hook for all of the ISA.
They then started billing me for it because I was working in tech, in the job I had for 6 years before I ever even started their program.
I went to a lawyer and was told it wasn't worth suing, because they required arbitration in NYC, which would cost more than I would save.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To this day, my most public contribution to reddit is that I wrote the code to put the title of the post in the URL.  That was done specifically for SEO purposes.
It was pretty much the only SEO optimization we ever did (along with a few DOM changes), because shortly after that, Google basically dedicated engineering effort specifically to crawling reddit.  So much so that we lost the "crawl rate" button in our SEO admin page on Google, it was just set to "Custom".
I had to stand up a fleet of app servers and caches and databases, and change the load balancers so that Google basically had their own infrastructure (although we would shunt all crawlers there).  Crawler traffic was very different than regular traffic -- it looked at pages more than two days old, something humans rarely did at the time.  It would blow out every cache (memory, database, disk, etc.).  So we put them on their own infra to keep them from killing the rest of the site.
And now I will hang an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time.]]></summary>

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40067677</id>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a project I've been working on for the last few months.
It's a new (I think) algorithm, that allows to adjust smoothly - and in real time - how many calculations you'd like to do during inference of an LLM model.
It seems that it's possible to do just 20-25% of weight multiplications instead of all of them, and still get good inference results.
I implemented it to run on M1/M2/M3 GPU. The mmul approximation itself can be pushed to run 2x fast before the quality of output collapses.
The inference speed is just a bit faster than Llama.cpp's, because the rest of implementation could be better, but with a better development I think it can be a new method to speed up inference - in addition to quantization.
You could call it ad-hoc model distillation :)
You can change the speed / accuracy of a model at will, in real time.
Oh, and as a side effect, the data format allows to also choose how much of the model you want to load into the memory. You can decide to skip say 10-20-40% of the least important weights.
It's implemented for Mistral, it was also tested slightly on Mixtral and Llama. It's for FP16 for now, but Q8 is in the works.
The algorithm is described here, and the implementation is open source.

I know these are bold claims, but I hope they survive the scrutiny :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.]]></summary>

By holding that the essence of private property is its ability to be sold or forfeited irreversibly, Roman law removed the archaic checks to foreclosure that prevented property from being concentrated in the hands of the few. This Roman concept of property is essentially creditor-oriented, and quickly became predatory. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was Alex (my name is not Alex).  Graduated high school in 97, but with a 2.1 GPA (yeah, pretty bad). Went to community college while working part time, living in a 'separated' household (mom/dad did the splits), supported both my parents both emotionally and financially (as much as I could) through their transition and new living arrangements.  We were all immigrants, and still learning the ropes in this wonderful country.  I did not graduate college, but instead went the part-time/apprenticeship/gain-experience route, while going through many roles.  My baseline was to be a good citizen.  A good son, a good partner, good friend, good husband and a good dad (4 wonderful kids).  There were many good times, but also sad times, including when we lost our house and cars (2008), and that month when we literally didn't have money for food... but this country gives you many opportunities.  There are safety nets, use them!  You just have to focus on the goal:  Move forward!  There is always someone else who needs more help than you.  Stay the course, and try not to lose perspective.
I'm one of the luckiest people alive because I live in this country, and was always able to surround myself with supportive, positive and forward thinkers.
I don't know why I shared this.  Maybe because I don't care to blame society for my adverse experiences.  Through those experiences, I learned to lead.  I learned to listen.  I learned to value and appreciate.  I learned to live.]]></summary>

Similarly artists have trouble securing large venues if not participating in their scheme.
This is the problem with most 'monopolies', they reach a certain critical mass where they can no longer be dealt with on even footing. You are at their mercy as a vendor and as a customer. You can often argue that 'choice' exists, but what choice is it really? Taylor Swift isn't going to come play at our local music house/bar.]]></summary>

I grew up in a 'high risk environment', and experienced all the adverse experiences with the exception of gun violence (yay Canada). I'm one of the few that 'made it out'. Many of my childhood friends are dead (usually overdoses), suffer from substance abuse, or are still stuck in the poverty cycle (on average it takes 7 generation to break the cycle).

I was underwhelmed by some points that seemed like they should have been more shocking. Look at the huge number of people in the many adverse experiences category who made it to college, and make a high salary. that was shocking! and look at the people who had no adverse experiences and still managed to end up poor. how does that happen?
I was left with the impression that if the government threw a lot of resources at it we might be able to move a noticeable percentage of those people in a better direction, but not most of them.
The questions that remain are, how many people's lives could we improve and by how much? And, critically,  how much are we willing to collectively sacrifice to move that percentage of people in a positive direction?]]></summary>

In other words, the artists, venues, producers, and Ticketmaster are in cahoots to fleece fans for as much money as possible, and Ticketmaster is willing to play the 'bad guy' and take the blame for high prices, and they get to keep a bigger slice of the overall pie than they would in a highly competitive market for ticketing services because they provide that "service".
Take away this dynamic, and the face price of tickets is going to go up, and the total price is unlikely to change substantially.
Personally, I think this would still be a net plus for society.  In order for market forces to work well, you need pricing transparency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've done a good amount of geospatial analysis for work.
One thing you quickly realize with geospatial data is that it's incredibly nuanced. You have to be quite careful about understanding which coordinate reference system (CRS) and for visualization which projection is being used. The CRS is somewhat paranoia inducing if you don't have great infrastructure setup with the right tools to carry that metadata with your geospatial data.
I've tested everything AWS has to offer, Postgres/PostGIS, Spark/DB, Snowflake, Trini, and ARCGis.
I'm convinced the best tool for large scale geospatial work is Google BigQuery and it's not even close. It took an expensive multi hour query running on PostGIS deployed on an enormous m6a EC2 instance to less than 5 seconds that ran in the BigQuery free tier. It does make sense if you think about it, Google was early with Maps, but it is just stunning how much better they are in this specific niche domain.
This was using publicly available FEMA data that Snowflake and AWS services would just choke on, because the geometry column exceeded their maximum byte size. Spark doesn't even have geospatial data types and the open source packages that add support leave a lot to be desired.
This guy is running on-prem, so maybe this made sense, but I just would never bother. The storage for BQ would probably be less than $100/months for 20 TB.]]></summary>

The etak system of navigation involves navigating by stars and ocean swells to get the heading, but a key issue when navigating by dead reckoning over long distances is that if you're a fraction of a degree off you may miss your destination and never know it, so it's also vitally important to know how far you've gone. This is hard when there are no landmarks. The navigators estimated their distance by using intermediary islands off to the side, which they viewed as coming towards them (from their point of view, the navigator stays motionless on the open ocean while the world moves towards them) and past them. These reference islands were called etaks.
However, confusingly, the etaks were generally not visible, being beyond the horizon, and sometimes did not even exist. The navigators would have named etaks that they pictured being just over the horizon, whether they were there or not, and would track their procession past their boat. When the set number of etaks had passed, they would know they were in the vicinity of the destination island. If they were not at the right time of day for birds to be out, they would then hang out in the area waiting to spot the birds leaving or returning at dawn or dusk.
So the system involves dead reckoning plus a system of turning the navigators' own well-developed intuition of how far they had travelled into a formalized system of generally-invisible islands that they used as a mental model to externalize this intuition.
(My knowledge of this is from Cognition in the wild, Hutchins, E., 1995.)
Edit: D'oh, I should have finished TFA. This is described at the end, although more roughly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is one of the all-time cryptography footguns, an absolutely perfect example of how systems development intuition fails in cryptography engineering.
The problem here is the distinction between an n-bit random number and n-bit modulus. In DSA, if you're working with a 521-bit modulus, and you need a random k value for it, k needs to be random across all 521-bits.
Systems programming intuition tells you that a 512-bit random number is, to within mind-boggling tolerances, as unguessable as a 521-bit random number. But that's not the point. A 512 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, which are legible to cryptanalysis as bias. In the DSA/ECDSA equation, this reduces through linear algebra to the Hidden Number Problem, solvable over some number of sample signatures for the private key using CVP.

While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The "AI" versions of the movie stills are darker and "greener" or "bluer" in all cases in this article, which is NOT the case when you watch the movie. It's a mistake on the part of whoever put together the image comparisons.
The culprit here is that the non-AI screenshots are taken from presumably 1080p non-HDR sources, while all the AI screenshots are taken from presumably 4K HDR sources. The "AI" images are all displayed in the completely wrong color space -- the dark+green/blue is exactly what HDR content looks like when played on software that doesn't correctly support decoding and displaying HDR content.
It's a shame that the creator of the comparison images doesn't know enough image processing to understand that you can't grab stills from HDR content from a player that doesn't properly support HDR.
On the other hand, the state of HDR support is a mess right now in software players. Playing HDR content in common players like VLC, QuickTime, IINA, and Infuse will give you significantly different results between all of them. So I can't actually blame the creator of the images 100%, because there isn't even a documented, standardized way to compare HDR to non-HDR content side-by-side, as far as I know (hence why each player maps the colors differently).]]></summary>

The sectors that are currently involved in this geopolitical race include semiconductors, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Despite their growing adoption, little is known about the effect of export controls on supply chains and the productive sector at large. Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.]]></summary>

Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.]]></summary>

Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.]]></summary>

start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.

Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.]]></summary>

with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>
