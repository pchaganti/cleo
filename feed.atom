I've published a few essays about how journaling has impacted my life by providing the space for me to reflect on my day. One thing I have never done until this year, however, is read any of my old journals.
This may seem strange, since what is the point of writing if not to be read. But that isn't why I do it. I write as a practice. As a thing that I do. If all my journals were lost in a house fire, I'd be sad, yes. But the documentation of my life isn't what's valuable. That value has already been gleaned through the act itself.

Second year dropping by the Pinole Pride / Juneteenth celebration event (6/9), and I was honestly a bit disappointed. Last year was the the inaugural event so it was understandably small. This year, it felt smaller and I'm not sure if it's because they didn't advertise enough? There were 2-3 food trucks and a few tables, but that's pretty much it. The bands were lively, and I think we missed some of the performances during the beginning of the day. The event was only 3hrs long, which was also SUPER short. We didn't even bother checking out the mini-petting zoo by the baseball fields.
In retrospect, I think it could also be because I'm used to attending big city Pride events, and have higher expectations. I understand that this is a small town event, so maybe this is actually pretty normal.
Anyways, here are some pictures.





There were a lot of dogs there, but of course Cocoa was the only one in a stroller. All the other dogs actually had to walk.
Hoping for a bigger turnout next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[it's easy to get distracted by the current discourse on what people are learning (or posing to learn).
you need to be careful on prioritising what you want to learn.
somehow these days the meme has been let's do hardware, c is cracked, we will go cuda. it's downstream of what influential figures like karpathy are pursuing.
problem is, mere exposure can make you feel more interested in new things like gpu programming, writing llm in c and unconsciously prioritise the same when let's say you were already trying to learn about the transformer architecture. (shiny object syndrome sort of situation lol)
frequently hopping bandwagons will lead to scattered attention and you don't want that. now i get it, you gotta pursue your intellectual curiosity but you also need to think from your usecase point of view.
what do i require to learn more urgently? what will allow me to build the thing i want to build faster? what is more relevant for me based on my previous understanding? is it worth going this deep in the stack for now?
depending on the time you have, you can pursue more than 2 things in parallel but you gotta stick to what you have decided atleast for a few days.]]></summary>

More than mere entertainment, music is a vessel for intimate meaning, a medium through which the most profound truths and innermost feelings can be expressed.
Michael Spitzer, a renowned musicologist, speaks about the origins of our innate musical inclinations, tracing them back to the Australopithecus, our southern ape ancestors who roamed the Earth over 4,000,000 years ago.
He unveils the profound connection between our walking patterns and the very essence of rhythm: when we stride forth, our steps fall into a natural, cadenced beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It's like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).
This perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.
On the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let's say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.
Thinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent about a year struggling with GJK back in the 1990s.
It's useful for collision detection in 3D, and it can also be used as a closest-points algorithm. As a closest-points algorithm, it's easy to understand the basics. You have two convex solids. Start with a random point on each, and get the distance between those points. On each solid, try to improve the distance by advancing along each edge from the current point. Pick the new closest point. Repeat.
This stops working when the closest point is no longer a vertex. That's when the "simplex" concept is needed. The closest points can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-edge, edge-face (no unique solution) and face-face (no unique solution). The simplex thing is really doing a case analysis of those cases.
Lots of things go wrong in practice. If you are doing a physics engine, objects will often settle into face-face contact. A single-point collision model will then result in vibration or incorrect movement. Also, as positions settle into face-face contact, the GJK algorithm runs into a small difference of large values problem that can result in a complete loss of floating point significance. 
The termination condition can also cause infinite looping.
In theory, this is an elegant solution, but it's a difficult numerical analysis problem.
Despite that, it's probably the fastest approach to the problem. It's O(log N) in normal cases, and O(1) for situations where the positions are closest to the previous positions and you use the last solution as the starting point.
The late Prof. Steven Cameron at Oxford did a lot of work on getting GJK right.
I used GJK in "Falling Bodies", the first commercial 3D ragdoll system, in the late 1990s.]]></summary>

But when the startup ends up selling for $250M, that $500k of 'early' selling would have been worth $5M (less any dilution between rounds) - hard not to regret the choice in that case even if hedging is going to be the correct choice 99% of the time.
IMHO, it's very easy not to regret, with those particular numbers.
I'd take $500K now plus possibly $45M later -- over $0 now and possibly $50M later.
I'd take that deal even if "possibly" were "guaranteed".

Editorial — Post-anarchism Today
 Lewis Call{1}
 Welcome to Post-anarchism Today. This is certainly not USA Today, et ce n’est certainement pas Aujourd’hui en France. Indeed, it is a refreshing antidote to all such discourses of modern state capitalism. During its short but colourful existence, post-anarchism has always been libertarian and socialist in its basic philosophical outlook: that’s the anarchism part. But post-@ has also maintained its independence from modern rationalism and modern concepts of subjectivity: that’s the post- part. As I survey post-anarchism today, I find to my surprise and delight that both parts are stronger than ever. It’s now clear t…]]></summary>

She invented superscalar architecture at IBM, just to be fired in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition, then 52 years later IBM formally apologized to her in 2020. She successfully rebooted her life, invented and taught VLSI design to industry pioneers who founded many successful companies based on the design methodology she invented, wrote the book on, and personally taught to them, and then she became a trans activist who helped many people transition, find each other, and avoid suicide, fight abuse and bigotry, and find acceptance, by telling her story and building an online community.

Over the years, I started facing a dilemma that I never truly faced when I was collecting other things like magnets or keychains: where do I put them? The idea of permanence gave me some unneeded anxiety. On one hand, I loved the idea of decorating my laptop with the stickers, but the thought of losing those stickers when my laptop died (because they all inevitable do), made me super sad. This hesitation led to a growing collection of stickers sitting unused, each waiting for that perfect place that never seemed to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IMHO "every day" is far too frequent, and this ADHD-ish attitude is one of the reasons why the quality of average software has gone down the drain. Developers need to step back, think more deeply, and not worry about being pressured into "shipping code" that barely works.
The dopamine rush of your code being shipped
This frequent overstimulation leads to less ability for long-term attention. When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.
Your team (and manager) sees you're working
Tough problems need time to solve, and you won't see much meanwhile. If needing to put on a show for others is more important than actually working, something is very wrong.
Your git commit streak looks good
Yes, people say this doesn't matter. But I'm sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn't a great look.
Optimising for metrics never works for those who can see through the illusion, and that's an increasing number of people over time. If I was a recruiter and saw that sort of activity, I wouldn't think of it as more than someone just putting on a show --- especially if the majority of those commits are effectively "thrashing" or "churning".
The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done
I can personally say that the satisfaction is far bigger the longer you've persevered.]]></summary>

Twitter broke my heart - it connected me to many cool people, helped me find an audience as a musician, and led to lifelong friendships.

Safari? Not on Windows.
Apple Music? This actually has a Windows client. I'm not sure how good it is. But Spotify supports Windows and even Linux.
Apple Password Manager? Will this be tied to iCloud? Will I be able to use it on Android? If I no longer have an iPhone will it be a pain to maintain and use?
A dog cannot serve two masters. A company like Apple doesn't see any of these things as a product. They're a means to an end: to push the iPhone platform (and hardware sales). That priority will always trump the interests of a product like this.
It's also why I refuse to buy more into Google products: it's too much of a risk to lose access to everything if Google wakes up one day and decides to suspend your account with no recourse other than making enough of a stink on social media such that an employee will actually look into it.

Nobody wants a GenAI feature that works in Gmail, a different one that works in Messages, etc. -- they want a platform capability that works anywhere they use text.
I'm not sure either Google or Microsoft are organizationally-capable of delivering that, at this point.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IMO this really feels like the Facebook / Twitter integration from early iOS. That only lasted a few years.
Apple clearly thinks it needs a dedicated LLM service atm. But still thinks it is only supplemental as they handle a bunch of the core stuff without it. And require explicit user consent to use OpenAI. And Apple clearly views it as a partial commodity since they even said they plan to add others.
Tough to bet against OpenAI right now...but this deal does not feel like a 10 year deal...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have to say, I was thoroughly  impressed by what Apple showed today with all this Personal AI stuff. And it proves that the real power of consumer AI will be in the hands of the platform owners where you have most of your digital life in already (Apple or Google for messaging, mail, photos, apps; Microsoft for work and/or life).
The way Siri can now perform actions based on context from emails and messages like setting calendar and reservations or asking about someone’s flight is so useful (can’t tell you how many times my brother didn’t bother to check the flight code I sent him via message when he asks me when I’m landing for pickup!).
I always saw this level of personal intelligence to come about at some point, but I didn’t expect Apple to hit it out of the park so strongly. Benefit of drawing people into their ecosystem.
Nevermind all the thought put into private cloud, integration with ChatGPT, the image generation playground, and Genmoji.  I can genuinely see all this being useful for “the rest of us,” to quote Craig. As someone who’s taken a pessimistic view of Apple software innovation the last several years, I’m amazed.
One caveat: the image generation of real people was super uncanny and made me uncomfortable. I would not be happy to receive one of those cold and impersonal, low-effort images as a birthday wish.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I parent a child with autism. The care needs are intense; the burnout is real. But I can't employ usual burnout mitigation techniques like taking time off or making career / lifestyle changes. The world relentlessly marches forward. However, I've learned human resilience is AMAZING. You'll be surprised at what you are capable of when life asks for it.
Here are a few big insights that have really helped me:
- You never have to feel like doing something to start doing it. This insight is so strangely freeing. It really got me out of my head and the loop that I was in berating myself about motivation.
- The act of doing something is usually what creates motivation to continue. Tell yourself you'll spend 30 minutes on whatever it is. No matter what it is, I always know I can survive 30 minutes of it. However, 90% of the time, the timer goes off, but I don't feel like stopping. I've found my grove and I keep going.
- Procrastination isn't poor time management; it's poor emotional management. Be gentle with yourself. Know that you can be scared, frustrated, or angry but don't have to let those emotions define you. CBT works really well here. Don't define emotions as "good" or "bad". Define them as "useful". If the emotion you feel isn't useful, acknowledge it, but realize it's fleeting and let it pass on. Some people like to visualize emotions as clouds drifting by.
"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."

 SOLIDARITY TO OLGA ECONOMIDOU 
 “Turn off the main switch in this dump. Here the beautiful becomes ugly, the choice becomes a habit and the meaningless important. Prison dirties creases and swallows pieces of dreams, desires, thoughts and feelings. Its most permanent residents, the majority of the prisoners are now a part of the appliances of the prison. Bars, yard, cameras, locks, prisoners mix all together and re-enact the world of captivity. Nothing is worthy in here. Come let’s go and don’t look back… Only fire will cleanse this place… ”

 On March 3rd, “justice” decided on the pre-trial detention of the mother of the comrades Christos and Gerasimos Tsakalos and the second one’s girlfriend, with the charge of accession and participation in a terrorist organization.
 Behind the obvious ridiculousness of the charge, it is the morbid vindictiveness of the counter-terrorism and the judicial authority hiding, which wishes to blackmail emotionally both the two comrades and all of us. It is not ju…]]></summary>

It is sometimes useful to keep a distance from events before you talk about them. Anticipation and the frozen time of captivity in prison accelerate, nevertheless, the cool-headed distance from events. A self-possessed distance gives you the opportunity to observe details which are usually ignored and bulldozed by the warm blood conditions’ momentum of intensity. So, as they often say, “the devil is hidden in the details”…

Until the day comes we will remain with the head held high....
1. Solidarity is our weapon
 Many things have been written and said about solidarity. Usually when there have been so many discussions and so many texts have circulated on a matter, it ends up trite, predictable and without any particular interest. It seems as if its content has run out and it’s constantly being repeated. 
 We believe there are no trite practices, but trite ways of thinking. Particularly today, in the suspicious days we are living in, with the dozens of imprisoned urban guerrillas and anarchists, we should sharpen the blade o…]]></summary>

I. “The days are coming when they try…”
 “Whoever passed by the front of a courthouse or prison and his look didn’t darken in the thought that he could be there as the culprit, then he did not live his time with integrity and dignity” 
 The attack on the Administrative Court is dedicated with all our fire to our brothers (G.Tsakalos, P.Argirou, H.Hajimihelakis) of the prisoner’s cell of the members of Conspiracy Cells of Fire. Our comrades and the honest minority of dignified revolutionary Persons political and civil, are not just a piec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minutes before I left home on Thursday one of my mom's coworkers pulled up on the driveway and handed me a plastic bag of zongzi as a going away gift. "Good luck with the move!" he said. "Go do what you love."
That last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.
A large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?
In Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that "looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything." I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I'm not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I'm nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I'm doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.
