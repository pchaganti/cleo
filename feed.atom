        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Faced with two wars, nuclear confrontation, extreme economic inequality, and a climate crisis -- not to mention threats to reproductive rights, forever chemicals, housing shortages, gun violence, and rising educational debt – what do 82% of Republican and 39% of Democratic voters, according to a Pew Research poll, say is the most important issue in the Presidential election? Immigration. A nation of immigrants, with dying main streets, empty classrooms, and labor shortages in key industries, is about to cast its votes based in large part on which candidate can best be trusted to reduce rates of both legal and illegal immigration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The launching of the widespread terror campaign targeting civilians in Lebanon is an integral part of the Israeli war strategy to achieve tactical military objectives. The new Israeli strikes which started on September 17 with the exploding pagers have resulted so far in more than 5000 killed and injured Lebanese.
For the past 11 months, the Lebanese Resistance limited its attacks exclusively to Israeli military bases, in or near, the "Jewish-only" colonies along the Lebanese border. The current Israeli assault was likely planned to take place on September 16 ahead of the aexplosion of the pagers, but had to be postponed due to an unforeseen clash with the visit of Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein. Consequently, Israel may have failed, either due to confusion or technical difficulties, to reprogram the pagers’ activation to another date. More

There is a dispute between Automattic and WPEngine. The resources of Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation should not be leverage in this dispute.
The fact that those boundaries are crossed means that anyone who is in competition with Automattic might have any and all ecosystems that Matt has any control over leveraged against them if they upset Matt or Automattic in any way.
It is very poor taste and changes the perspective of the product. Instead of a professional entity who will engage professionally it is now a form of leverage that a single person could wield against anyone who crosses them.

I am a spacecraft engineer. I don’t see anything in the linked article indicating that they are actually running Windows - the BSOD claim is tongue-in-cheek, or at least that’s how I read it. I also don’t know of anyone anywhere that runs Windows on a spacecraft, with the exception of laptops used by astronauts. Typically one runs vxWorks, or maybe QNX. Some experimental (high risk, low cost) systems run Linux. Older spacecraft don't run any OS at all, everything is running on bare metal, and that may be true for a handful of current spacecraft as well.
Windows is used in some places by ground controllers, but these days they tend to be running Linux a lot more often.]]></summary>

That's why it took so long for me to seek help when I was going through the most challenging time of my life. I thought it was a sign of weakness – a failure, a loser.
When I finally came to my senses and got the help I needed, you might think that kind of foolish reasoning was finally gone, right? Nope, not at all!
Two weeks into treatment, I called my doctor and explained that I'd figured out how to fix this on my own. Of course, he strongly advised against it but said it was ultimately my decision.
After the call, I started thinking...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> "I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read."
This is now to me the "old school" internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don't blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly "Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?"
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it's been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don't participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these "professional" creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.]]></summary>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary dream…]]></summary>

DJ: What is Anarchism? 
JZ: I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination. This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn't really my choice; the doctor said that they could "try to do some creative billing," but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i'm away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i'm living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i've met so many wonderful friends. i've lost a few. i've bought a car. i've gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i've had more than a few mental health episodes... i've also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i've learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what'll happen in the next five!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.
I don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.
I have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.
this isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.
I don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?
but it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.
do what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.
on my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm currently on the hunt for a job. I was previously in a decently paid if incredibly monotonous QA job and while the firing sucked, I wasn't particularly distraught over it: I went to work there mainly because there was a lot of downtime and it gave me time to do homework and prepare for tests, so I didn't have to pick between school and work, and instead do school at work. Beyond that, it was fairly dead-end job and once I was approaching graduation I started looking for greener, brighter pastures.  "Maybe a gaming job," I thought to myself, "or just a regular backend gig. I'm sure I can find some sort of junior position to slot into in no time at all."
That was about four months ago and now my standards are somewhere along the Mariana Trench.

It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.
I’ll give you an example.

These are the questions posed by Matthew Graybosch for September's IndieWeb Carnival, Power Underneath Despair.
My darkest moment in life occurred about five years ago. For a long time, I understood that something wasn't right, but refused to accept it — both for those around me and for myself.
"I'm handling this myself! I won’t let anyone think there’s something wrong with me, ever. I got this!"
I tried weight training, yoga, meditation, running, seeking spirituality, reading books, attending online events, going on retreats…

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it's because i need to promote something or i'm reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don't like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn't; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed "posting" on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr's design the most) so i'm unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i'll ask them. if i'm gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i'll message them instead of posting into the void.
it's all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don't know what's going on because you're shouting into the void and they're not in it, but you don't actively talk to them because there's this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i'm pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i'm looking forward to never thinking about social media again.]]></summary>

Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone's site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers.

There are pretty common ethical standards about disclosing vulnerabilities privately before disclosing them publicly. I don't see how the obviousness of the vulnerability changes the situation. By warning the company, you give them the opportunity to remedy the problem before announcing to the world that anyone with a laptop can exploit it. Probably they were just hoping that nobody would notice, which is stupid of course, but now they don't have the chance to build up a better wall before the flood of fake orders that could cause real harm to the small businesses whose financial information you disclosed online.

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…]]></summary>

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside. This (rather incomplete) article resumes the story of that conflict as seen through the eyes of what is now the CNT (CIT).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).]]></summary>

This add-on for the Bearming theme allows you to include buttons for emailing, printing, and sharing your blog posts on social media (see examples at the bottom of this page).
To use the add-on, which requires the latest version of the Bearming theme (1.3), add the code below to the end of your posts. If you prefer to avoid adding it manually each time, paste the code into your post template (Bear dashboard -> Posts -> Edit template).
<ul class="share">
<li><a href="mailto:?subject={{ post_title }}&body=Hey there,%0D%0A%0D%0AI saw this post and thought you might like it:%0D%0A{{ post_link }}"><span class="material-icons">mail</span> Email</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:if(window.print)window.print()"> <span class="material-icons">print</span> Print</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url={{ post_link }}&title={{ post_title }}" target="_blank"> <span class="material-icons">share</span> Share</a></li>
</ul>

Then add the following style to your theme:
/* Share buttons */
.share {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
}
.share li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 7px;
  line-height: 41px;
}
.share a {
  padding: 6px 10px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  text-decoration: none;
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
.share a:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.material-icons {
  font-family: 'Material Icons';
  font-size: 16px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  vertical-align: text-top;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-feature-settings: 'liga';
}

That's it! I hope your readers find this feature useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the ways that I'm fortunate is that I enjoy simple pleasures the most. I have no need for elaborate, constant, and expensive variety to be satisfied. It's not that I don't enjoy an occasional adventure—I do. It's just that I am very happy to have a nice time in my own home, surrounded by the things I've already accumulated that bring me pleasure. It was only as a teenager that I felt that restless call to get out and get away from home to experience something besides the same old, same old.
Granted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don't have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I've been to a few really enjoy…]]></summary>

(note: this post is image-heavy)
I bought a new camera this week. Or, at least, a refurbished one, purchased on impulse as part of a mad scramble to fill my life with things to do that don't involve looking at a computer.
This isn't my first flirtation with photography. A brief obsession with the fantastic Umurangi Generation pushed me to pick up a cheap Centon df300 a few years back. I love film, I really do; the warm texture of shots, the ritual of getting it developed, the unpredictability of how things will turn out. But between the cost and time it took to see the results and the technical fussiness of keeping a decades-old handheld working, I slowly began to fall off.
