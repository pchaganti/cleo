Nos piden desde el principio un régimen perfecto, garantía de que las cosas se harán así y no de este otro modo, sin coscorrones, sin tanteos. Si hubiéramos de aprender a vivirlo, no terminaríamos nunca el aprendizaje. Ni el niño aprendería a andar, ni el chico montaría en bicicleta, ni sería posible adquirir un oficio o una especialización. Al contrario, en la vida se hacen al revés las cosas.

Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/29784831>

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…]]></summary>

In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.]]></summary>

Add in the ability today to buy and sell to others along an internet-enabled, “bi-directional” grid, however, and we could soon be embarking on the next big thing or an unregulated free-for-all with everyday customers holding the bag.

Notes: Translated by Andrea Asali, from “‘La nazione armata,’” La Rivoluzione Sociale (London), no. 4 (November 15, 1902), published in ‘The Complete Works of Malatesta, Vol. V, The Armed Strike: The Long London Exile of 1900–13′ (2023), edited by Davide Turcato, who notes that "In the debate on how the army should be structured, a debate that has accompanied the history of unified Italy, the 'armed nation' was the model that federalist and democratic forces opposed to that of the permanent army at the sovereign’s service. Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(ARC Prize co-founder here).
Ryan's work is legitimately interesting and novel "LLM reasoning" research! The core idea:
> get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s)
Roughly, he's implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we'd love to see more of.
A couple important notes:
1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).
2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn't been validated or scrutinized yet.
All said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We'll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard
EDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember doing laser cooling of rubidium atoms in physics class. It's really cool how it works:
* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.
* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn't affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.
Rubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.]]></summary>

It meant people learnt their software at home and then insisted on using it at work, where it would be a paid for license.
It seems their attitudes changed soon after, perhaps due to their almost total market dominance, and they became aggressive towards their users in the pursuit of profits. The last Adobe software I really used was Lightroom as that was one of the last pay-once software titles. Now the only Adobe product most of us at work have is except Acrobat Reader.

Some APIs are very stable, and testing against the API itself can hit rate limiting, bans, and other anti-abuse mechanisms that introduce all kinds of instability to your test suite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because the Bantu languages (most prominently: Swahili) and Japanese have similar sound systems.   Finnish is also oddly similar-sounding, or Hawaiian.  None of them are actually related.
It's because the syllable is restricted in the number of possible forms, in a similar way.  (And they all have approximately five vowels.  And a pitch accent.)  In Hawaiian, nothing but consonant + vowel syllables are possible.  Swahili and Japanese allow an optional final n sound.  Finnish is a little more flexible, and syllables can end with an n, r, l or t.  No consonant clusters, in any of the languages.  No syllables ending with consonants outside the restricted set (if any), in any of the languages.
This results in a lot of syllables of the form: i, a, ne, na, ka, ta, po, to...  "Pokatokaino".  I just made that up and it's probably not a Swahili, Finnish, Hawaiian, or Japanese word -- but it could be.
This basic pattern (consonant + vowel + maybe limited option for final consonant) is very common; it's the most common arrangement among the worlds languages.   Far more common than languages like English which allow monstrosities like "strengths" (which is 6 consonants and one vowel).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have always loved reading, even as a child. I remember reading under the covers until 2am, way past lights out and my bedtime. I would go to the library after school and put my name down on the waiting list for newly released books. I'd (im)patiently wait for my turn.
But for some reason, I never appreciated the books we were assigned to read in school. I'm not quite sure if it's due to the selection of books, or just the fact that I was required to read it (I’m not great at being told what to do). Either way, I would read the books I wanted, and read cliff notes (are cliff notes still a thing today?) of those that I didn't read for school.
Needless to say, I completely regret showing a lack of appreciation for the classic books. To make up for it, I am attempting to build up a collection of books I admire that I should've appreciated a long time ago. The goal is to get the covers I remember from back in the day, instead of the more modernized version.
Yesterday’s thrift finds:
Bridge to Terabithia
A Wrinkle in Time
The Great Gatsby
The Metamorphoses
It joins my (still small) existing collection of:
Lord of the Flies
To Kill a Mockingbird
A Tale of Two Cities
Fahrenheit 451
Gulliver's Travels
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
Now I just need to find the time to re-read them all. Do you have a favorite classic must-read?
Bonus find: An original Sound of Music vinyl record -- this was a super happy find. I initially found a really scratched one, but thankfully found a total of THREE at the thrift store. I was able to pick the one that didn't have a lot of scratches on it. Super excited to play it on the record player.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think a lot of people don't realize that there was a decent size, but small market for SBCs for low-volume embedded work (including hobbyists) before Raspberry Pi. You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.
Broadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.
5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.
What's always been funny to me about the scientific approach to animal consciousness/emotions/empathy is that in a perfectly rational world the default assumption would be that animals and humans exist along a spectrum and there isn't a sharp cliff where humans are 100% conscious and empathetic but dogs are 0%. The claim that humans are categorically different than other animals is the extraordinary one, not the claim that we are made of mostly the same stuff.
The only reason why animal consciousness has been controversial historically is a religious one—the Bible has typically been read as placing humanity in a category of its own. And yet we see countless secular scientists clinging to that perspective when even a cursory glance at the evidence and a basic application of Occam's razor would suggest the opposite.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I self-host a (non-critical) mail server and a few other things and occasionally look at live firewall logs, seeing the constant flow of illegitimate traffic hitting random ports all over the place, some hitting legitimate service ports but others just probing basically anything and everything. I decided to setup a series of scripts that detect activity on ports that aren't open (and therefore there's no legitimate reason for the traffic to exist) and block those IP addresses from the service ports since the traffic source isn't to be trusted.
Something that came out of analysis of the blocked IP addresses was that I discovered a few untrustworthy /24 networks belonging to a bunch of "internet security companies" whose core business seems to depend on flooding the entire IPv4 space with daily scans. Blocking these Internet scanner networks significantly reduced the uninvited activity on my open service ports. And by significantly I mean easily over 50% of unwanted traffic is blocked.
Network lists and various scripts to achieve my setup can be found here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity
Internet Scanner lists are here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
Large networks that seem responsible for more than their fair share of uninvited activity are listed here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
I'm semi-aware of the futility of blocking IP addresses and networks. I do believe, however, that it can significantly reduce the load on the next layers of security that require computation for pattern matching etc.
Be aware: there are footguns to be found here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been preparing for job interviews (looking to get into genai+backend roles you know). I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My notes say it was 193k at the start. The final dashboard when we stopped said "216,626 / 216,890 = 99.8%; 264 to go".
The other correction I would make is that this post does not mention Nilton Volpato, who had written an earlier Buildifier and graciously accepted replacing his implementation with a new one and then taking over ownership for that new implementation as well. (Eventually ownership moved to Laurent's team.)
It looks like it was just under 2,000 commits. We did pretty extensive testing, by having Blaze load a BUILD file and its transitive closure and then dump that parsed form back out to a binary format. Any automated commit had to preserve that parsed-and-dumped binary format bit for bit. The slowest part of the testing was waiting for Blaze to do all the loads.
Every day I would prepare and test as many files as I could, break them into CLs (think PRs), mail Rob a shell script he could run to approve them all, and go to bed. Then I'd get up early in the morning (5am ET) to submit the changes, because there were various cached indexes that got updated when BUILD files got submitted, and it seemed better to send them when not many people would be working.
That scheme worked until a system did fall over and someone got paged, and then after that I agreed to only submit the large changes during business hours. :-)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two different questions at play here, and we need to be careful what we wish for.
The first concern is the most legitimate one: can I stop an LLM from training itself on my data? This should be possible and Perplexity should absolutely make it easy to block them from training.
The second concern, though, is can Perplexity do a live web query to my website and present data from my website in a format that the user asks for? Arguing that we should ban this moves into very dangerous territory.
Everything from ad blockers to reader mode to screen readers do exactly the same thing that Perplexity is doing here, with the only difference being that they tend to be exclusively local. The very nature of a "user agent" is to be an automated tool that manipulates content hosted on the internet according to the specifications given to the tool by the user. I have a hard time seeing an argument against Perplexity using this data in this way that wouldn't apply equally to countless tools that we already all use and which companies try with varying degrees of success to block.
I don't want to live in a world where website owners can use DRM to force me to display their website in exactly the way that their designers envisioned it. I want to be able to write scripts to manipulate the page and present it in a way that's useful for me. I don't currently use llms this way, but I'm uncomfortable with arguing that it's unethical for them to do that so long as they're citing the source.]]></summary>

There are many excellent blogging platforms available nowadays. The concept of "better" is not especially relevant. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences and requirements.
This post outlines why I chose Bear after trying many different tools. If your blogging preferences align with mine, then Bear might be the right platform for you too. If you're already happy with your current tool, congratulations – no need to keep reading.

He has also written about the childlike nature of certain rock and pop songs, especially certain songs by The Beatles and Donovan. He has interviewed artists, musicians, writers and others from Chinua Achebe to John Lennon and many more. His works refer to everyone from Carl Jung to Tony Bennett; Rollo May to the Old Testament; Greg Bateson to Gaston Bachelard. At times, his ability to connect seemingly disparate phenomena is mind-blowing. Other time, one nods their head knowingly at a reference that they might have often considered just to see it verified via Cott’s quotation and argument tying the two things together. Some might consider his considerations too fanciful while others might see them as so simply obvious they wonder why he bothered to even write them down.

 War is the health of the State.

The machinery of government sets and enforces the drastic penalties. The minorities are either intimidated into silence, or brought slowly around by subtle process of persuasion which may seem to them really to be converting them. Of course, the ideal of perfect loyalty, perfect uniformity is never really attained. […] (I)n …]]></summary>

I also don't think it's cynical to think that a manager looking for a reason to get rid of someone will have a much easier time justifying a PIP or just straight up firing someone if they can retroactively have an AI do it for them.
Why wouldn't they be able to ask the system "how much of 's time do they spend doing things on the computer that are not directly related to ?"

 Your own kind over the abstract confines 
 Of a triple helix with the extra back 
 Bone of suffering.

 Memories that we perhaps should forget but cannot 
 Unsee through flashbacks of those who harmed - 
 Us, through bricks at glass and break the institution 
 That hates us - that seeks to eradicate us

I've published a few essays about how journaling has impacted my life by providing the space for me to reflect on my day. One thing I have never done until this year, however, is read any of my old journals.
This may seem strange, since what is the point of writing if not to be read. But that isn't why I do it. I write as a practice. As a thing that I do. If all my journals were lost in a house fire, I'd be sad, yes. But the documentation of my life isn't what's valuable. That value has already been gleaned through the act itself.

The New York-based former members of the American Situationist International had largely gone silent, had disappeared from t…]]></summary>

Introduction
Who is Jean-Pierre Voyer?
 French social thinkers don’t have the best reputation in America. Typically they are seen as humorless, self-important, elitist intellectuals whose purpose is to tell the world not only what to believe, but what to do with those beliefs. We know Jean-Pierre Voyer, and he is none of those things. He has worked as a cab driver, a plumber an…]]></summary>

- Install a recorder which records everything you do. For the benefit of users of course - you know, what if a user missed an ad and wants to go back and see what they missed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It's like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).
This perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.
On the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let's say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.
Thinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.]]></summary>
