 Historically, it’s been hard to find any information of anarchism in central Africa, there was the short lived Anarchist & Workers’ Solidarity Movement (AWSM) in Zambia led by Willstar Choongo, Zambia in the mid nineties had a very small “left” and Willstar came up through organising his fellow workers at the University of Zambia (UNZA), his group would later be kicked out of the University for advocating decentralisation and organising meetings outside of political parties [1].

Coding, CASE tools, even Rails and the rest of the opinionated web tools.
Every generation has to learn “There is no silver bullet”.
Even though Fred Brooks explained why in 1986. There are essential tasks and there are accidental tasks. The tools really only help with the accidental tasks.
AI is a fabulous tool that is way more flexible than previous attempts because I can just talk to it in English and it covers every accidental issue you can imagine. But it can’t do the essential work of complexity management for the same reason it can’t prove an unproven maths problem.

For Freire, education and literacy were revolutionary tools for developing an anti-capitalist consciousness.  However, as Freire’s work traveled from Brazil to Latin America, Africa, and the hybrid cultural borderlands of North America, it was and has often been appropriated in ways that dilute its radical essence.

 In the early beginnings of Freedom, some sixteen years ago, there was in our paper an article, entitled ‘Local Action’, which attracted at that time a good deal of attention in Socialist circles. Till then, the workers had been told that the socialisation of the factories, the mines and so on, could only be accomplished by the State, by an Act of Parliament. However, the Paris Commune had commenced, since 1871, a new era of communal revolutions. It had indicated to us that, in all probability, the Social Revolution would begin in many points of every territory at once.

 People are often drawn to the study of labour history because they want to understand how to change the world. It is thought that the history of class struggle contains within itself not only a series of events and dates laid out in chronological order but also lessons. Through studying the history of class struggle we can establish with evidence what strategies and tactics work or do not work, why movements grow and why they collapse, what challenges social movements will have to overcome and so on. The necessity of studying history emerges from the fact that socialists cannot run scientific experiments in a laboratory and thereby establish the definitive formula for revolution.

 For far too long have radical communities and their discourses treated domestic violence and abuse as external from the considerations of revolutionary struggle. Abuse is seen as simply an interpersonal issue, springing from individual pathology which we must address by correcting certain behaviors and teaching better communication skills. The intervention tools of choice are frequently limited to restorative or transformative justice practices, with the ultimate aim of protecting and maintaining the abuser’s place in the community, often at the cost of surv…]]></summary>

Title: James Connolly and Syndicalism

Notes: Excerpted from “James Connolly: Labor, Empire, Ireland”.
Source: The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism

 By the early 1900s, James Connolly, with the Irish Socialist Republican Party still struggling to make an impression on the Irish political scene, had become aware of the American Socialist Labor Party, which seemed to be attaining some successes under the energetic leadership of Daniel DeLeon. The context for Connolly’s learning of the SLP and DeLeon was a debate within the Second International on the question of socialist parties making alliance with bourgeois parties: DeLeon and his SLP were fiercely opposed to such marriages of convenience, as were Connolly and the ISRP. He tried t…]]></summary>

Background
 On November 27th the loose coalition of forces that has been engaged in a years-long military conflict with the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, broke out of a containment zone in the country’s North Western Idlib province. In a matter of days they were able to drive out government forces and claim control over Aleppo, the country’s most populous city. 
 While made up of a variety of discrete factions, the group responsible for leading the lightning advance is Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)…]]></summary>

 Juan García Oliver gave a lecture at a union hall in the El Clot district to an exclusively worker audience on the parallels between Socrates and Christ’s lives. He was extremely eloquent and expounded original ideas as he shared his knowledge of the Socratic philosophy with the workers. And if the speaker is admirable—this young man who gave himself an exceptional education in hours robbed from sleep and during long years spent in prison—the same can be said of the audience.

 A series of events have occurred between the publication of my article “A Circular and its Consequences” and the present. In the first place, a group of militants—which the bourgeois press, Macià, and Companys describe as the “sensible part” of the Confederation—published a manifesto. Second, there was the strike in Barcelona, which Governor Anguera de Sojo, a creature of Maura, caused with his unspeakable attitude toward the prisoners.

 We anarchists will respond in an energetic but noble way to the attack made upon us by some members of the Confederation. I hope it’s clear that this is a direct attack on García Oliver and me. That’s natural; I clashed with these figures when I arrived in Barcelona and, after we spoke for several hours, it became obvious that we had two different positions, which are only becoming more and more distinct.

 Our movement is often criticized for its lack of ideological content and this objection is perhaps not without foundation. Nevertheless, we are victims of a lack of understanding and misinterpretation. 
 If we compare our movement with those in other countries, I sincerely believe that its ‘theories’ are not brilliant. But if the Spanish proletariat isn’t educated at the European level, it has, to even things out, a richness of perception and a far superior social intuition.

 In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, the gravitational pull of electoral politics has gripped the left with renewed intensity. Fueled by the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders, discontent with political elites and the failure of the Democratic Party to defeat Trump, various segments of the left see an opening for breathing new life into building a “party of the 99 percent,” a “party of a new type” or a “mass socialist party.” Others are content running leftist candidates as Democrats under the guise of radical pragmatism.

 The old cry that Anarchists are haters of mankind, and apostles of wholesale destruction, is beginning to die out.

Multitudes of earnest and thoughful men and women of every class are beginning to recognize the sublimity of the Anarchist ideal. The ground of criticism has entirely shifted. Instead of being denounced as human monsters, Anarchists are now accused of being unpractical idealists. Only the grossly ignorant now assail us from the old standpoint. It has beco…]]></summary>

The ultimate success of this strategy depends on what we might call the enterprise AI adoption curve - whether large organizations will prioritize the kind of integrated, reliable, and "safe" AI solutions OpenAI is positioning itself to provide over cheaper but potentially less polished alternatives.
This is strikingly similar to IBM's historical bet on enterprise computing - sacrificing the low-end market to focus on high-value enterprise customers who would pay premium prices for reliability and integration.

No they are most certainly not. Corruption is in McKinsey's DNA.

Companies like McKinsey, Bain, Accenture, etc., have been instrumental in the rapid increase of executive compensation, flat comp for workers compared to inflation, intentionally unsafe practices and corner-cutting to save money, and just generally creating as many negative externalities as possible in the name of feeding the beast that Milton Friedman created with his rhetoric about the primacy of the shareholder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article’s headline is rather misleading (I assume unintentionally), because it omits that the actual seizure and data access was done pursuant to warrants. Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.
Here, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.
In this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One key motivation for imposing tariffs on imported goods is to protect U.S. firms from foreign competition. By taxing imports, domestic prices become relatively cheaper, and Americans switch expenditure from foreign goods to domestic goods, thereby expanding the domestic industry. In a recent Liberty Street Economics post, we highlighted that our recent study found large aggregate losses to the U.S. from the U.S.-China trade war. Here, we delve into the cross-sectional patterns in search of segments of the economy that may have benefited from import protection. What we find, instead, is that most firms suffered large valuation losses on tariff-announcement days. We also document that these financial losses translated into future reductions in profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity.]]></summary>

 Coercive control, a framework originally conceptualized in Evan Stark’s Coercive Control: How Men Entrap Women in Everyday Life and widely utilized in domestic violence theory, is one that can be expanded to understand the tactics and underlying values of all forms of authoritarian control. I have argued for this in other essays and have alluded to how an understanding of domestic violence can sharpen one’s political analysis of authoritarianism in other forms. In this essay, I will demonstrate just how such an analysis can be applied to better understand the tact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from "ordinary expenses" as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people's intuition of what "living paycheck-to-paycheck" means. That isn't nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.
There is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; "ordinary" is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as "ordinary". By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.
By contrast, the median US household has >$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as "ordinary" and therefore not saving it. The categories of "non-ordinary" expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.
The implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.
Americans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During 2018-19, the U.S. levied import tariffs of 10 to 50 percent on more than $300 billion of imports from China, and in response China retaliated with high tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. Estimating the aggregate impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy is challenging because tariffs can affect the economy through many different channels. In addition to changing relative prices, tariffs can impact productivity and economic uncertainty. Moreover, these effects can take years to become apparent in the data, and it is difficult to know what the future implications of a tariff are likely to be. In a recent paper, we argue that financial market data can be very useful in this context because market participants have strong incentives to carefully analyze the implications of a tariff announcement on firm profitability through various channels. We show that researchers can use movements in asset prices on days in which tariffs are announced to obtain estimates of market expectations of the present discounted value of firm cash flows, which then can be used to assess the welfare impact of tariffs. These estimates suggest that the trade war between the U.S. and China between 2018 and 2019 had a negative effect on the U.S. economy that is substantially larger than past estimates.]]></summary>

* Don't add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed.
* Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.)
* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week.
* Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclosure: HPC admin who works with NIVIDA cards here.
Because, no. It's not as simple as that.
NVIDIA has a complete ecosystem now. They have cards. They have cards of cards (platforms), which they produce, validate and sell. They have NVLink crossbars and switches which connects these cards on their card of cards with very high speeds and low latency.
For inter-server communication they have libraries which coordinate cards, workloads and computations.
They bought Mellanox, but that can be used by anyone, so there's no lock-in for now.
As a tangent, NVIDIA has a whole set of standards for pumping tremendous amount of data in and out of these mesh of cards. Let it be GPU-Direct storage or specialized daemons which handle data transfers on and off cards.
If you think that you can connect n cards on PCIe bus and just send workloads to them and solve problems magically, you'll hurt yourself a lot, both performance and psychology wise.
You have to build a stack which can perform these things with maximum possible performance to be able to compute with NVIDIA. It's not just emulating CUDA, now. Esp., on the high end of the AI spectrum (GenAI, MultiCard, MultiSystem, etc.).
For other lower end, multi-tenant scenarios, they have card virtualization, MIG, etc. for card sharing. You have to complete on that, too, for cloud and smaller applications.]]></summary>

I embody those same sentiments.
A lot of my friends and family don’t know I blog or make zines. This breaks my heart because I consider these creative pursuits a big part of my life. It’s what I spend the most time thinking about.
Only recently have I nonchalantly told my bf about my website and zine making. It felt like a big deal sharing that information bc I'm such a private person, but I don't think he's checked it out yet.

It's been seven months since I started my weekly email letters, and I've put so much work into these missives.
I've asked people to financially support my email letters, but unfortunately, it's not panning out, and I'm unsure how to move forward.
Working towards something without moving the needle doesn't feel good.
It sucks to admit failure, and it sucks that it's not working out. Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn't enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.
Much self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making. When my efforts prove financially unsuccessful, it feels like a direct hit to my purpose/aim in life, which is a terrible feeling to reconcile. I have no idea how to untangle this.
Do I hit delete on my online efforts/website and write anonymously somewhere else? Perhaps.]]></summary>

Normally, I feel like I’m going so fast, I really don’t have time to think about who I am or what I’m doing. I’m just reacting, then reacting some more, and clinging onto anything that’ll get me through the day.
Living in such a way has no doubt created a bit of an identity crisis for me. I haven’t had this much free time to just feel myself out and discover the true me. Interestingly, things haven’t gone exactly the way I thought they would.
The internal battle I’ve dealt with my entire life has been this idea of masculinity vs. myself. I’ve convinced myself that the things I like are beneath me or should be in the past. My inter…]]></summary>

 From the 5th to the 7th of July, Prishtina, Kosova, transformed into a hub of anarchist thought, coordination, and solidarity as it hosted the 16th edition of the Balkan Anarchist Bookfair (BAB). This first-ever anarchist gathering in an Albanian-speaking locality brought together over 250 participants from 29 countries, spanning from Chile to Azerbaijan. A total of 32 collectives and initiatives exhibited books and zines, and 18 discussions and events were organized, showcasing the movement’s all-encompassing diversity. In the true spirit of collectivism and mutual aid, participants got engage…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I've been thinking about this for a while but couldn't gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn't work long-term. You don't smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you're never free from the thought "I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now." That's why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn't help me), or some other activity where you don't think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it's simply a fact I didn't want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that's it. I don't see anything wrong with games if they don't interfere with main tasks and don't cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people's blogs. Until recently, I didn't even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people's posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I'm very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it's much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn't waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.
Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, "I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....," which was code for "I want the night off."
I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.]]></summary>

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.]]></summary>

 Everything has its cost: our time, once spent, can be bought back neither by king nor trillionaire. We give up our time for what we do not want; 10-20 years for a house, 5-10 for a car, 50-100 hours per month for food, then phone bills, utilities, holiday gifts, shopping shopping shopping. We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt. Our careers become our lives. 
 In exchange for lost time we reproduce ourselves as obedient laborers, our consciousness accepts the global economic system as not only necessary but good, our taxes directly fund the imperialist monstrosities of the day, while our contribution to the GDP indirectly funds them. 
 We aim…]]></summary>

 One of the most pressing questions in our organization at the moment pertains to the anarchist’s influence in the unions. I remember past times when anarchists, who shunned rather than sought organizational posts, were seen as the best guarantee of revolutionary success, thanks to their moral solvency and especially their revolutionary intransigence. But apparently things have changed and now it is that very intransigence that is attacked most harshly. 
 “We defend the CNT’s independence,” they tell us, but then carry on about the so-called dictato…]]></summary>

 Captain, I’ve seen my comrades fall in slow death throes and then collapse on the ground, blood pouring out of their mouths, while life flees through small holes in their foreheads. These holes of death crush the skulls of their victims and comprehension in those who reflect upon them. Anido and Arlegui ordered it. 
 I’ve seen kicks destroy teeth, eyebrows, and lips; men fall unconscious only to be revived with pails of water…]]></summary>
