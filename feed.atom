 An ‘inimitable singularity’: this is how Ronald Creagh described the American utopian communities he studied for his doctoral thesis. [1] But Ronald himself was also an inimitable singularity. 
 A cosmopolitan by family and culture, with British, Italian, Egyptian roots, he had studied in France and written his MA on the free thought periodicals in nineteenth century North America – after having been a priest for many years. He then turned towards the early anarchist movement; this led him to visit the CIRA library (Centre international de recherches sur l’anarchisme) in Lausanne, in the early ’70s. My mother, who was in charge at that time, sugges…]]></summary>

 Ronald Creagh took great satisfaction from the fact that he was born in Alexandria, Egypt, a historic city that was the centre of ancient learning. He grew up in a multicultural milieu in Port Said, Egypt. He was the offspring of a British-Sicilian father and a Franco-Lebanese mother and was taught Sicilian by his paternal grandmother. He said that Sicilian was his first language. 
 In 1947, his family migrated to Australia, while Ronald moved to France to become a Roman Catholic priest. He took a degree in sociology at the Sorbonne, a masters’ degree at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, and then taught at the Institute of Human Sciences and Techniques and…]]></summary>

 Longtime French anarchist scholar and activist Ronald Creagh died on September 8 at age 94. 
 He was in touch with anarchists and anti-authoritarians on several continents. Those who knew him personally appreciated his broad-minded openness and supportive spirit. 
 Some Fifth Estate staffers were among those who found him engaging and attentive in conversations on many subjects. In recent years he was a regular reader of our online current and past articles and enjoyed discussing them. 
 Ronald was born in Egypt in 1929, the son of a Lebanese mother and an Eng…]]></summary>

 Given the political crisis that Venezuela is going through and that was manifested in the events before, during and after April 11, we anarchists consider it necessary to state our position. In this regard, therefore: 
 1) Hugo Chavez's contradictory policies have not benefited the most disadvantaged sectors of the country, increasing in three years of management the rates of poverty, unemployment and social insecurity. In addition, his government repeats errors and vices characteristic of previous ones. But in no way do the sectors of the current oppositi…]]></summary>

 But still we know that when the Europeans came, the Bushmen lived in small tribes (or clans), sometimes federated together; that they used to hunt in common, and divided the spoil without quarrelling; that they never abandoned their wounded, and displayed strong affection to their comrades.

Translator’s Note
 Until the post-Cultural Revolution thaw that began in 1979, Chinese readers found it next to impossible to gain access to information about the strong anarchist influence within their country’s revolutionary movement. From the point of view of the ruling Communist Party, in whose favour historical materials were invariably rewritten, this was a necessity borne out by the fact that, when people took to the streets in 1989 to demand a degree of control over their own lives, among t…]]></summary>

I go back and forth between purely taking digital notes for work and using pen and paper. For the past few years, I’ve switched to digital note taking because it’s easier to cmd + f to find what I’m looking for. However, with the constant game of musical chairs that is my dual-laptop setup for work, I end up using different applications for notes and, in turn, losing them anyway1.
And so, armed with this new pen I wanted to practice writing with, I decided to switch back to pen-and-paper mode, and back to the work notebook I’ve used on and off since 2017 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I disagree with Dan due to my experience as an low level employee under Ballmer. He encouraged political infighting and backstabbing and dog eat dog internal competition, while praising and desiring tight integration between teams.
He wanted "cloud first, moblie first" - two firsts! The culture at the time was built around RAID - the internal bug datadbase and that there should be clear prioritization for everything.
The inability to decide between enterprise cloud and consumer client devices held Microsoft back.
Ballmer had customers asking for enterprise cloud in 2000 but he kept listening to people talking about lifting windows sales by 10 percent with search integrated to the desktop.
And then they chose the bloated  SQL server for that and wondered why that couldn't run on normal consumer hardware in Longhorn.
The fundamental tradeoffs between something that sacrifices generalization for specialization and efficiency meant that what is good for running server rack NASDAQ didn't work for low powered laptops.
From a low level employee perspective Ballmer was the ruthless guy that wanted people to hate each other at work as they fought for survival lord of the flies style but was pikachu surprised that we could never deliver integrated experiences that worked together.
Satya's two key abilites to me were the ability to actually prioritize in a coherent way and the decision to bring the rank and file infighting down because integrated experiences are hard to build when you want your brother and sister departments to fail so yours gets more budget because thats how Ballmer worked.]]></summary>

The problem with Microsoft was everything went through Windows. The entire company was designed to promote Windows.
This was the fundamental flaw with Microsoft that Nadella changed. He quickly not just made Windows just another part of Microsoft’s business, to a great extent he actively devalued it.
The fact that Ballmer invested in Azure, etc before Nadella would all be irrelevant because under Ballmer Azure would have remained a red headed step child to Windows, so it’s unlikely to have seen much success under him anyways.

I can't speak to his business skills, but I can attest that he never once offered a tip for his daily black iced tea. We'd even have it ready for him before he showed up so he never had to wait! He would pay with cash, and I'd hand him his change and drink, and that was that.
It's funny to me now: one of the richest men in the world and he never once offered a tip.
Frugality aside, he was always very polite and warm so I can't be mad. Makes for a good ice breaker story.
Edit: holy moly, this is a sensitive subject. Please remember this was from a time before tipflation. Tipping meant you left your change behind once in a while only if you felt the desire to show appreciation. It wasn't an obligation. Yes, I still do think it's a funny story.

You can't be serious. Maybe on Android, but on other platforms—especially iOS—they stick out like a sore thumb.
A number of them just look like Material Design Android apps awkwardly transplanted over, but I know that's down to the developer so I won't hold that against Flutter. But scrolling through the Flutter showcase[0] and calling those apps up to look at screenshots on the App Store—none of them look like native iOS apps. They don't look bad (mostly), but they don't fit in.

If "only" 50 people working on a project used by one million people was unworkably low then every single successful project out there would be doomed. I've certainly worked on things with much worse ratios than that.

External contributions from 1500 developers over a decade is a lot. That is an unusually high number, not a low one, and backs up Flutter's claim to love external contributions.
The fact that this person thinks that they can just magically conjure up dozens of volunteer PR reviewers is wild. Everything about this post makes it pretty clear that they don't have the slightest clue of the scope of what they're trying to do.

Today, my sales guy was trying to register for WordCamp, a conference that we have been attending for years as an essential place to meet customers. And then he encountered the registration form for a WordPress.org login, which neatly specifies that you affirm you have no “affiliation with WP Engine, whether financial or otherwise.” [1]
Of course, my company does have an affiliation with WP Engine. We use their service to host our website. Therefore, nobody on my team can register for a WordPress.org account.
I wrote an open letter to Matt Mullenweg complaining about the requirement and stating that I believe it violates the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by being an overly broad prohibition that is clearly anti-competitive and has no clear business justification (aside from limiting competition).
Matt and the rest of the people backing Automattic should take note: Moves like this that destroy your community will eventually usher in a replacement. WordPress is pretty neat, but it only got that way because thousands of people put millions of hours into building add-ons and hosting services to make it blossom into what it is today. If their efforts are redirected in another direction, WordPress will wither away to nothing in a few years.

I love the 5k screen on this iMac but the CPU is too old for photo or video editing as software got so much slower over the years. 
I could have used this screen for many more years, but now it will hit landfill... Apple is only "green" in their presentations - in reality they care more about inifite sales only.]]></summary>

This is not because we suddenly see the light, nor because our worst days are magically transmuted into some type of epiphany, and not because someone saves us from our own madness. Rock bottom becomes a turning point because it is only at that point that most people think: I never want to feel this way again.
That thought is not just an idea. It is a declaration and a resolution. It is one of the most life-changing things you can ever experience. It becomes the foundation upon which you build everything else.
When you decide you truly do not ever want to feel a certain way again, you set out on a journey of self-awareness, learning, and growth that leads you to radically reinvent who you are.
In that moment, fault becomes irrel…]]></summary>

Raphael Sassaki: How did you come up with the idea of Jerusalem, which tells a story that spreads through 1000 years in Northampton? How was the writing of it?
Alan Moore: Rather than originating from a single idea, Jerusalem is more the convergence of several different impulses and concepts. Foremost amongst these were the growing need to talk about the tiny but historically peculiar district I was raised in, and the simultaneous urge to talk about my family in a way that included both its history and its mythology.

About a decade ago, I ventured my opinion that the adult multitudes queueing for superhero movies were potentially an indicator of emotional arrest, which could have worrying political and social implications. Since at that time Brexit, Donald Trump and fascist populism hadn’t happened yet, my evidently crazy diatribe was largely met with outrage from the fan community, some of whom angrily demanded I be extradited to the US and made to stand trial for my crimes against superhumanity – which I felt didn’t necessarily disprove my allegations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we're going to talk about how to "scale care" and how not to, then Buurtzorg has to be mentioned[0][1]. It's a Dutch home-care company that was started by nurses who basically got frustrated that managers got in the way of them doing their job. It operates by having a flat organization working with small teams of highly trained nurses, and trusting them to make the right decisions. The result is a low-cost provider of high-quality health-care.
So when the author says care "doesn't scale", they obviously mean "you need a one-to-one ratio of caretakers", which I fully agree with. But what they're also accidentally doing in the process is explaining why creating bigger teams with bigger hierarchies and structures does not appear to increase the efficiency of care.
Some projects do need big teams with hierarchies - even in healthcare. Effectively responding to a pandemic comes to mind. I suspect it's when the core problem to tackle most naturally breaks down like a tree - a hierarchy then mirrors the way the problem breaks down. For some projects, like general homecare, the efficiency sweet spot is a flat structure of autonomous individual teams, because it doesn't scale beyond those teams anyway.
And just like the author concludes, I find that there's something comforting about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me the most important issue that needs to be solved right now is the increasing urban sprawl and the car dependent neighborhoods. It causes social isolation. Maintaining infrastructure like roads and electricity, is causing a strain on the economy for local municipalities. Not to mention the disastrous effect car based transportation has on the environment.
I am a fullstack developer living in Norway. Last year I registered the Norwegian branch of the Architectural Uproar as a not for profit organization. With the support from paying members, I have been able to go on tour to most of the major cities in Norway. We organize large meetings were we discuss architecture and city planning with politicians, architects and property developers on stage.
I am strongly inspired by Create Streets in UK and Strong Towns in the US. I want to improve people’s quality of life, help saving the planet and make Norway beautiful again while doing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In early October 2024, Professor Joseph Massad of Columbia University gave an interview to the online news site Electronic Intifada. In it he explained that there is a “huge gap” between the academic (evidence-based) understanding of aspects of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict (such as the Jewish supremacist nature of Israeli society and its resulting apartheid policies) and the mainstream media assumptions about (a “democratic” and “progressive”) Israel. The latter define the popular and official reporting about that country and its Zionist ideology.  More

 If there is any event that can bring about a rediscovery of inner strength on the part of organized labor and the libertarian elements of the world, it is the grand struggle against Fascism now being waged in Spain. After the unresisting defeat of the labor movement in Germany the effect of the heroic battle of the Spanish workers, peasants, and intellectuals against the Fascist bandits is that of a refreshing thunderstorm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to struggle with explaining why some of my friends or family members didn’t quite fit into any of the 16 MBTI personality types. A friend of mine seemed like an INFP but had traits of an ISTJ, and my cousin felt like an ESFP, yet was as considerate as an ESFJ.
Then I stumbled upon Personality Ninja (or "NXT"), which uses 32 types instead of just 16. Suddenly, things started to make sense.
At first, I thought, “What? There are only 16 types!” But after trying it out with friends, I realized their new descriptions actually felt accurate. This system offered flexibility and depth the original 16 types didn’t seem to capture.
Curious, I dove deeper into whether 32 types could really work—and found out there’s no reason they can’t! If you look back at Carl Jung, who created the concept of cognitive functions, he didn’t enforce the rigid stacks we see in MBTI or the Harold Grant function model.
Personality Ninja’s approach allows both the first and second functions to be in the same attitude (both extraverted or both introverted), unlike MBTI’s requirement for them to be opposites.
This flexibility means types don’t have to follow TeSi or SiTe formats—they can be TeSe or SiTi. It was the answer I’d been looking for: my friend turned out to be FiSi, while my cousin was FeSe.
So if you’ve ever felt stuck trying to fit yourself or others into the 16 types, it might be worth exploring the 32-type approach!]]></summary>

I woke up at 7 and had my first morning workout in a long time, just to keep my mind off things. I'm hoping I can get into a routine with exercise again — I've spent most of the the past few weeks in bed (injuries, mood, medical reasons) and my muscles have gotten noticeably weaker. I missed it. Exercise has always been therapeutic for me; I like being able to focus on something external and feeling a pain that you know will fade.

cohost went read-only on the first. i went to a user meetup / wake in northampton the following weekend. i continued my job hunt (successful, btw). i tried (and largely failed) to rest. i learned that i am extremely bad at being unemployed.
everyone i talked to told me that it's pretty normal to not do anything in that window, that it's normal and reasonable to need a break. unfortunately, it did not feel like i was resting, it just felt like i couldn't do anything (distinct! not fun!).
anyway. tomorrow i start a new job, which will give me some structure in my day again. i get novelty—meeting new people, working on new things, experiencing and solving new problems. i'm looking forward to it.
weird, rough month. i am tired. someday i will be able to rest, but it is not right now.
i want to actually keep up with this blog more. i hadn't really realized it had been nearly a month since my last post. time flies. when i have things to write about, i'll do it here. that's about all i can promise.

I’m no stranger to hand and wrist pain, but this one has remained for a few weeks, which is a little concerning. I can’t even do something as simple as a plank without it hurting.
I’ve not been doing anything new, laptop setup-, writing- and drawing-wise, so I’m inclined to believe I strained it at the gym some weeks ago and just thought it would go away with the rest of my soreness, but apparently not! I’m probably going to ask my trainer tomorrow what is up and what I can do for it, and if the pain continues to stay, see someone about it. I’d hate it so much if “not being able to put weight on one wrist” became a lifelong limitation.

I did it because my illness/medication related hair loss just didn't stop for months now and I didn't like any of it. The hair on all my clothes, on the floor, in the bed, the shower and sink drains. I never had especially voluminous hair; I was on the lower average of the amount, and it was fine hair. But with now less than half left and no signs of slowing down, it was shitty to style, was constantly stringy even when it wasn't greasy, and had no volume at all. The edges of where my face met my hair were really thinning as well; thankfully no bald spots. I like having very long hair, but not when it is so little.

If you're thinking about "what have I accomplished?" instead of "I'm having so much fun!" then it might not be for you.
The other aspect is there are plenty of people that like to think like programmers, but have no experience programming and the barrier to entry for a videogame is substantially lower than even figuring out a "hello world!" program for someone who wouldn't even know how to pick a programming language.]]></summary>

But it's not always possible for us to change the situation, no matter how much we would like to. Then the other option remains: to accept the situation.
Not in a resigned and negative way. Nor in a false way by convincing ourselves that everything is fine. But simply with a truthful view of the situation as it is right now, in this moment.
It pretty much comes down to both these choices we have in life:
Change
Acceptance
You want a higher salary, so you try to change the situation by asking for a raise. If it's accepted, the situation is resolved. If you are turned down, the option remains to change jobs or accept the situation.
If you can't change jobs and refuse to accept the current situation, then you have utilized yet another of humanity's abilities:
You have created a problem for yourself.]]></summary>

AT Protocol works like the Web, where each user is a website and each application is a search engine. The apps crawl the network of hosts and aggregate activity. We have over 100 outside hosts and at least 3 aggregating apps out there. It’s a different model than ActivityPub, which is more akin to email.
We never said no algorithm. I don’t know where that meme comes from. We have an open system for algorithms, which we and 3p devs can operate. We have a default algorithm for every user called Discover. It was one of our main concerns to have an answer to algorithms in a decentralized network.
For DID PLC, the likely solution is to move the registry into a nonprofit which will maintain it, similar to ICANN. We also support the Web DID method, and if folks like this remain concerned we’re open to other DID methods. It’s important, but roughly similar to DNS or TLS issuers; supporting infra to the application network.]]></summary>

I purchased a valuable premium domain to host a personal art collection (of anime cels). For some bizarre reason, the site was inaccessible from my work computer and it was de-listed from Google even if I typed the url itself into search.
I hired a square space specialist to figure out why, to no avail. I then begged our company’s CISO to investigate and it turns out we had some firewall setting on UniFi that blocked the domain because it appeared on a list. Once I checked way back, it turns out that it was as an anime porn aggregator years back. I personally reached out to all the web filters out there (Google, Symantec, bing) and one by one filed tickets for them to mark it as art instead of pornography and it worked.  I am now properly crawled on Google but still MIA on Bing, search console is giving me some BS error that’s incomprehensible, typical of MSFT.]]></summary>

Bezos is making a bad business decision for The Washington Post, sacrificing it and losing readers for the sake of his other business interests, i.e., government contracts.

Since then, we've seen a slow and steady march in the direction we all dreaded. Country after country has decided that they have the right to block content on the "free and open Internet", and business after business (even those who joined the SOPA protests) has complied. Someone looking ahead from 2012 would barely recognize the internet today as being the same thing, the way we just roll over to the threats that used to cause global outrage and defiance.
Were we naive even at the time? Have governments become more authoritarian? Or has our energy for resistance just been slowly whittled away?

Interesting, I've always felt that browser-based password managers provided remarkably little value for most people.

When you have never seen a stroke patient in person it is very unnerving. I wasn't really prepared but not sure how you could be until you get there. It really makes it hit home just how dangerous and life-altering it is.
"Thankfully" it was just one clot and she was eligible for a procedure to go in and try to remove the clot. Unfortunately the hospital doesn't have the facilities to do that procedure so she had to be moved to another hospital about 30 minutes away. It wa…]]></summary>

So for the past years, I played 2048 during takeoff and landing, and it worked. It helped me to focus on something else, not the airplane, and I started to enjoying more my trips.
Now I don't need to do it anymore, but just for the experience I still do it when I fly. So thank you for helping me with my fear!]]></summary>
