        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't read the article, it's about how people having kids later means you won't meet your great grandparents.
My mom had me when she was 23, and her mom had her at 22. I'm in my forties and still have two living grandparents, and am very grateful for them. I remember a lot of days where my grandmother watched me and my sister, and she was able to do that because she was only in her late 40's herself and plenty mobile. I knew two of my great grandmothers, one of them only dying in my teens.
Not everyone can rely on parents to help with childcare, but it is worth keeping in mind that if you wait until your mid 30's they might not be able to catch a running toddler like they could a decade earlier.
My mom also managed to have a really good career, though she went to night school when I was around 6 and worked her ass off in general. But, she had a high earning partner to support her.
I don't really have a single point here, except that I worry we've ignored the less-obvious downsides to people delaying childbearing until their mid 30's.]]></summary>

With the advent of modern management theories it is becoming common for organizations to deal with problems in a collective manner, by dividing programs into subprograms, with no one left responsible for the entire effort. There is also the tendency to establish more and more levels of management, on the theory that this gives better control. These are but different forms of shared responsibility, which easily lead to no one being responsible—a problems that often inheres in large corporations as well as in the Defense Department.
To contrast here is a statement from Calhoun: “We caused the problem. And we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders, and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence,” Calhoun said.
That we is him failing to take personal responsibility and choosing instead to spread responsibility to all employees, making no one responsible for the state of Boeing.
Boeing needs a leader who will take personal responsibility.]]></summary>

The basic answer: most people don't go to the ER for emergencies. That is, they go for something like a rash, cough, or fatigue that they know is not an emergency. Many of them just want work notes, although some are convinced they have a legit emergency.
We scoop up the real emergencies from the waiting room ASAP. Eg, no one in the waiting room is wearing a tourniquet; if they are, it's my job to either fix the bleed or get them to a vascular surgeon ASAP if I can't.
The majority of people who spend hours in the ER waiting room have vastly higher time preference than your or I, and often lower socioeconomic status and higher anxiety as well. Often they can't afford phone service or even a car, so it's hard for them to get places quickly. Others are homeless and want a place to sleep or very anxious and just want to be somewhere with other people in the middle of the night.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on a synthetic DNA assembly company. Basically, I figured out how to assemble DNA for people at a fraction of what it normally costs, so they give me a sequence, and then I make it in real life for them, then ship it to them.
Most of my customers have been AI protein designers, ironically. Turns out SOMEBODY has to wrangle atoms in the real biological world and that’s me!
After almost a year of work I finally smoothed out all the kinks in the process, so can now go from a design to synthetic DNA in a cell in about a week (not counting oligo pool synthesis time). I can do about 600,000bp per week, which is large enough to synthesize the smallest bacterial genome (each week), tho I only do about 1000bp fragments. I’m also completely bootstrapped and self funded, and only get help from my several opentrons robots]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current personal suspicion after watching your linked video (excellent discussion by the wgowshipping author) is:
Catastrophic engine failure (1:24) causing wide scale power loss.
No rudder control, rudder drift, and ship alignment drift (1:24-1:25:30)
Power restored and ship reengages prop with bad ship/ruddder alignment (1:25).  However, ship is now pushing itself into a further bad turn. Pilot likely stomps the brakes realizing misalignment.  Obviously 2-3 minutes is not enough to stop 100,000 tons at 8.5 kts, since it only got to 7.5 kts before crashing.  Power loss may have caused total rudder loss.
Similar to a car that hits ice, wheels have arbitrary alignment when they reengage road, when power starts being delivered again, car swerves towards concrete barrier even with brakes.  Driver with limited crash experience is mostly just panicking and stomping.
How many pilots, trained or not, really have any experience with a 100,000 ton ship in a crash situation with responses where seconds matter?
Edit: Also, economic disaster for Baltimore.
> (Wiki) The Port of Baltimore generates $3 billion in annual wages and salary, as well as supporting 14,630 direct jobs and 108,000 jobs connected to port work. In 2014, the port generated more than $300 million in taxes.  1st in automobiles, light trucks, farm and construction machinery, imported forest products, aluminum, and sugar. 2nd in coal exports.
Edit2: Bloomberg has an economic look including info on autos.  ~$500 million in March 2024 so far.  Honda, Mercedes, Subaru likely worst hit.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJmvXiCWkAAgDcE?format=png&name=...
3,600 commercial trucks / day.  Hazardous material transport has a 30 mile detour.  Baltimore had $350 million of insurance.  However, Brent Spence Bridge is noted for cost comparison at $3.6 billion and 1/5 the length.
Baltimore StreamTime also has live view with ongoing discussion.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83a7h3kkgPg]]></summary>

He says that at about 1:24 AM the ship loses power (from video feed) while traveling 8.5 knots.
at 1:25.30 power is restored.
at 12:25.59 the ship shows smoke.  The ship has already drifted in the channel. It is believed that at this time the ship applied full reverse power as evidenced by the black smoke. (My analysis: the ship drifted but hasn't turned in the channel, more of a translation)
By 1:26.45 the ship has obviously turned in the channel pointing at the pier.  Full reverse would cause prop walk to change heading angle;
1:28.52 impact at 7.6 Knots.  Camera says 1:28.52, AIS reports the ship still moving at 1:29:35

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least in the links with the video now you can see that the container ship directly hits one of the two main (and in the central area only) pillars completely collapsing it.
No matter(1) the engineering there is no pretty much way to not lose the whole large middle area and left area leading to the destroyed pillar in that situation.
Such a collapse crates so much force (tension vibrations etc.) so that the collapse of the section right of the right pillar is not unreasonable.
The only question is if the impact should have made the pillar collapse.
But a loaded container ship is ... absurdly massive I mean they are like multiple  high raise building (but not sky scrapers) standing squished together side by side. So the force it can apply is huge and if cargo moving in it there will be force applied to whatever it crashes into even after the initial impact.
And looking at the waves caused by impact with the base it was at least 8m high I think (depending on the container ship). So that wasn't a "slow moving" impact. And even slow moving impacts with container ships can tear apart a solid jetty.
So while the US has issues with infrastructure maintenance idk. if anything but building a many pillar bridge would have made any difference. And building a many pillar bridge might not be very viable depending on the under water landscape and water use under the main area.
EDIT: Looking at pictures with daylight where you can try to estimate the high of the ship using containers I would say the waves where handwavingly 4 containers high so ~9.5m and it also looks like the ship might have embedded half of the pillars fundament into/under itself (but it's a bit hard to tell to the angle of the picture). I think if that's the case probably the huge majority of bridge pillars of past and presence would have collapsed.]]></summary>

It’s surprising that ships capable of doing this damage were probably regularly driving past it, and its safety as a thoroughfare depended entirely on those collisions not happening.
Does anyone know if modern construction standards would require more stability after a ship collision, or is this still how we build bridges?]]></summary>

In this article, General Schill wrote that his troops are “ready” for any confrontation and that he could mobilize 60,000 of France’s 121,000 soldiers within a month for any conflict. He quoted the old Latin phrase—“if you want peace, prepare for war”—and then wrote, “The sources of crisis are multiplying and carry with them risks of spiraling or extending.” More

That said, this is pretty dismaying. I've been using Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo for years. Their standalone and non-subscription based apps are perfect for my usecase. Compared to Adobe, they are a no-brainer. But, I don't think Canva would leave them be as is. Either next versions will be a subscription or a rug pull is coming for the existing version.

I work with large volumes of data from many different sources. I’m lucky to get them to send csv. Of course there are better formats, but all these sources aren’t able to agree on some successful format.
Csv that’s zipped is producible and readable by everyone. And that makes is more efficient.
I’ve been reading these “everyone is stupid, why don’t they just do the simple, right thing and I don’t understand the real reason for success” articles for so long it just makes me think the author doesn’t have a mentor or an editor with deep experience.
It’s like arguing how much mp3 sucks and how we should all just use flac.
The author means well, I’m sure. Maybe his next article will be about how airlines should speak Esperanto because English is such a flawed language. That’s a clever and unique observation.]]></summary>

As an individual owner of a server, if that server has ECC and you expect to notice machine halts due to uncorrectable ECC errors, the security implications for you are modest.
Now, if you are a cloud provider that provides VMs on multitenant hosts, your threat model may be different.
Either way, avoid machines without ECC. TRR was a lame duck even when Rowhammer was still fresh, and bits flipping in DRAM will not go away unless the economics in DRAM manufacturing change (e.g. not).]]></summary>

One day, while helping someone get their car out of an impound, i was informed by the officer on duty that my license was not showing as valid. They couldn't tell why though, said the status/notes listed made no sense to her, and i should contact the Denver office to find out what is going on. I was rather confused, as it had been many years since i had last been pulled over, for a minor speeding ticket.
Denver was similarly confused by the details. After some research, they tell me what appears to have happened was i paid my ticket years ago by check, in person. They recorded they received the check on time, but either due to a clerical error or something (they aren't sure), a late fee was assessed on my ticket prior to the payment being processed. The fee was, i think, $5.
Around this same time, i moved, and while i changed my address with the USPS, i didn't with the DMV. The DMV was thus sending my "you owe us $5" letters with "Do Not Forward" instructions via the USPS, who were knowingly delivering the mail to the wrong address (my old place).
When i discovered all of this, years later, my license had been suspended for 54 weeks due to delinquency. In CO, if your license has been suspended for over 1 year, you may not just satisfy the debt, you must also retake your driving test. But since i didn't take my original test in CO, i would also need to re-apply for a permit and pass a written permit exam before being allowed to schedule my drivers test.
The poor lady i spoke with in the Denver office recognized the sheer absurdity of everything she was telling me, but could do nothing to fix it. She also let me know the outstanding debt was now $15.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins?

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.]]></summary>

In this post, we examine the unemployment-inflation trade-off over the past few years through the lens of a New Keynesian Phillips curve, based on our recent paper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflation around the world increased dramatically with the reopening of economies following COVID-19. After reaching a peak of 11 percent in the second quarter of 2021, world trade prices dropped by more than five percentage points by the middle of 2023. U.S. import prices followed a similar pattern, albeit with a lower peak and a deeper trough. In a new study, we investigate what drove these price movements by using information on the prices charged for products shipped from fifty-two exporters to fifty-two importers, comprising more than twenty-five million trade flows. We uncover several patterns in the data: (i) From 2021:Q1 to 2022:Q2, almost all of the growth in U.S. import prices can be attributed to global factors, that is, trends present in most countries; (ii) at the end of 2022, U.S. import price inflation started to be driven by U.S. demand factors; (iii) in 2023, foreign suppliers to the U.S. market caught up with demand and account for the decline in import price inflation, with a significant role played by China.]]></summary>

of Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let's put the spotlight on SIG
