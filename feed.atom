        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not arguing that “Project 2025” is directly comparable to Adolf Hitler’s autobiographical manifesto “Mein Kampf,” but there are some similarities in their political ideology and their political plans for the United States and Germany, respectively.  Both documents are “blueprints for authoritarianism.” As the saying goes, often you need to be forewarned in order to be forearmed.

For years, China has attempted to play a role in Middle East politics, particularly in the region's most enduring crisis, the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
In 2021, China announced its four-point plan, aimed at “comprehensively, fairly and permanently” resolving the Palestinian question. More

Imagine you have 1,000 votes. You want to show that your political party got 60% of the vote, so, you claim:
My party: 600 votes
Opposition: 300 votes
Other: 100 votes
Presto, we got a good breakdown. The people will buy it....
It makes sense that 600 is exactly 60% of 1,000, because this was an artificial example.
But in the real world, we don't get 1,000 votes.
We get 10,058,774 votes. What are the odds that the % of votes you get is a round number like 60%, or 51.2%? They're infinitesimally small. You're much more likely to get ugly numbers, like 59.941323854% of the vote, unless you choose some artificial percentage and work backward.]]></summary>

The Embarcadero holds a special place in my heart because it's the first place I felt most at home in when we first moved into the city. When we moved to California in 2019, I worked in the building right behind Cupid's Span. During lunch time, I would walk down Embarcadero, eat lunch at the Ferry Building, or just go to the building's rooftop to admire the views of the Bay Bridge.
It can get a little touristy in this area since at the end of the Embarcadero is Fisherman's Wharf. Most of the time tourists don't venture this far up away from Pier 39 (where the seals are), but sometimes they do because of the Ferry Building.
I have walked, biked, scootered, and longboarded up and down this strip, and is truly one of my favorite things to see and do.

Cupid's Span - Sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I've been a technical writer for ~12 years. I actually started out my career migrating a startup's docs from Word to Sphinx. Then I did a lot of time on Google's proprietary CMS/platform for developer docs. Then a few years on Eleventy-based sites. For the last two years I've been back on a Sphinx-based site (pigweed.dev). I've also done some odd jobs for readme.com-based startups and have dabbled in Docusaurus, Astro, and Hugo.
reStructuredText (reST) by itself can be pretty rough. reST combined with Sphinx is pretty great. I.e. the strengths of Sphinx far outweigh the weaknesses of reST. For big, professional docs sites (+100 pages, +10 contributors) I have pretty strong opinions that Sphinx is probably the most responsible choice, long-term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a long time Amazonian. The big problem is legacy employees run every part of the company. Almost any manager of managers has been at Amazon a long time, in that same job for a long time. There is no upward mobility at the company, unless you have been in some org 5+ years. In Alexa, the people running the core ML teams have been in Alexa since it started. Most people in decision making positions just got there first (10-15 years ago)
The software engineering paradigms used within the company create brittle rube goldberg machines of events flowing everywhere in the company. Almost all of them are on maintenance mode, where the oncall burns out the engineers and prevents them from creating new products. There is no knowledge sharing between team members. Legacy team members guard their technical platform knowledge to solidify their place on the team.
The engineers themselves are not students of computer science, but just crunch out tickets.
If Amazon wants to change they need to remove a significant amount of tenured employees, and actually promote young engineers into decision making positions.
AWS hasnt released an innovative product in a really long time]]></summary>

 On many levels it seems almost pointless to write yet another text on Aufhebengate, especially a review about a book on the scandal and the controversies and collaboration-sympathizing that occurred in the vain, and inexplicable, attempt to defend John Drury from his own actions. Usually interpersonal issues point more to the poverty of the militancy and viability of certain circles of so-called “radical scenes” than anything of consequence.

Title: A Catalyst for Fascist Reaction
Date: 7/20/2024
Source: https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/a-catalyst-for-fascist-reaction/

 The fallout from the attempted assassination on United States presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, will bring an increase in fascist propaganda and reactionary attitudes, while also having serious societal repercussions for marginalized groups and political dissidents. While anarchists typically, and rightfully, disparage engagement in electoral politics, the occurrence of this event will likely have effects far beyond just the 2024 United States election. The main focus of this article is to engage with the likely fallout and effects of such an assassination attempt, rather than discuss the actuality of the attempt in a substantive manner.

Country drives, flea market barn jaunts, dinner with his mom, double dog walks + cuddled-up binging our favorite show.

out-the-car-window farm gem
He took me to see his parent's house, where he grew up which he’s called home his entire life.
It's strange to witness someone have such an intimate connection to land and environment. The ease and pride as he recounts the tapestry of stories that make up his town. I envy his deep roots.
I've moved so many times that I've lost count of how many addresses I've held.
He said he wanted to share his roots with me. Might have been the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me.

red rubber ball, Courtice, ON
On Sunday, he took me to the Courtice Flea Market, where I found two records that I immediately bought:

Tony Molina, Confront The Truth, 2016. Think: Weezer, The Beatles, with a dash of punk.

Cat Power, Moon Pix, 1998. What a breathtaking cover.

Garden of Love Tarot. This gorgeous deck is a burlesque take on the original Tarot de Marseilles. Yes pls.
Cassidy Williams's post about how hard it is to be paid for creative work filled me with over-brimming madness, frustration, and sadness. How do we change our perceptions of money?

1. It doesn't matter what your title is, how much expert education, training, or experience you have, or even what hard lessons that you have learned: you are not an "expert" in an area unless you are invited in as an "expert".  Put another way, unsolicited advice is unwelcome.
2. Smart people want to solve their own problems.  Don't offer solutions.  No one will feel empowered or much of a sense of accomplishment implementing your solution.  Instead tell them the challenges that they will face for various options and let them draw their own conclusions.
3. Your spouse just wants to vent, UNLESS they say "fix it" in which case they want you to fix it, where "fix" means "make it act like I want it to".  Your spouse does not want to know how it works so that they can fix it themselves next time, and their mental model is wrong and they don't care to correct it.  Just listen, figure out what they want and do it yourself, and do it again next time even though it interrupted you and they could have fixed it themself.]]></summary>

When I get into this head space, one of the things that helps is working out and running. Runners high and all that. I attempted to wake up 2 hours before my meeting to give myself time to get a workout in but I failed… epically. It’s no surprise because I really am NOT a morning person, so 5am wake up calls are next to impossible.
So maybe I should’ve set a more attainable goal for myself.

1) All common statistical tests are linear models: https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/
2) Linear models are linear in the parameters, not the response! E.g. y = a*sin(x)+bx^2 is a linear model.
3) By choosing an appropriate spline basis, many non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response can be modelled by linear models.
4) And if that flexibility isn't enough, by virtue of the Taylor Theorem, linear relations are often a good approximation of non-linear ones.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think one of the key points that is often not understood widely is that car-centric infrastructure causes things to be spaced so much farther apart (with unpleasant empty tarmac) than necessary. If every building is surrounded by a border of 15 meters of roads, that significantly expands the distances that a person needs to travel to get anywhere. This further prioritises cars and drives demand and cultural norms.
I don't think we should be trying to get away from cars altogether by any means, but I think we should seriously consider banning them almost entirely from city centres. There's still a need for emergency vehicles and goods to be transported within the city, so we would still need some roads, but we could eliminate a considerable number of lanes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't think that the Internet was created to survive a nuclear strike, but I think we can say that it was _designed_ to survive a nuclear strike, that was one of the reason that packet switching was invented (compared to the traditional, at the time, circuit switching).
The idea of packet switching as a way make a communication network more robust came to Paul Baran a few years earlier, and while it was not the basis of Arpanet, it probably influenced it. Wikipedia [1] is not the best of the sources, but it sums it up nicely:
"After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran took on the task of designing a "survivable" communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Then, most American military communications used high-frequency connections, which could be put out of action for many hours by a nuclear attack.
[...]
After proving survivability, Baran and his team needed to show proof of concept for that design so that it could be built. [...] The result was one of the first store-and-forward data layer switching protocols, a link-state/distance vector routing protocol, and an unproved connection-oriented transport protocol. Explicit detail of the designs can be found in the complete series of reports On Distributed Communications, published by RAND in 1964.
[...]
The Distributed Network that Baran introduced was intended to route around damage.
[...]
In 1969, when the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) started developing the idea of an internetworked set of terminals to share computing resources, the reference materials that they considered included Baran and the RAND Corporation's "On Distributed Communications" volumes. The resiliency of a packet-switched network that uses link-state routing protocols, which are used on the Internet, stems in some part from the research to develop a network that could survive a nuclear attack."

1. The depth - which is only 7ft in Paris, unusually shallow for a competition pool.
2. The sides. Does the water spill over the sides into the gutters, or smash into a wall and bounce back, creating more chop.
A trained eye can see all the swimmers in Paris struggling in their last 10-20 meters (heck, an untrained eye can spot some of these). Bummer that it makes the meet feel slow but at least it generally affects all the swimmers equally]]></summary>

It took me a couple awkward minutes to realize that I'm the only one standing on my feet and not sitting in a car wherever I was looking. I apologized (???) and told them I was heading to a museum, bc I'm a visitor here and that's what we do right? I added a colleague's address and assured them that I'm not "confused", and will take an Uber now.
This was simply unbelievable in my world; for the next week I observed my colleague, whenever they took me out, or went to somewhere: we never walked outside. From the building to the parking lot, from the destination parking lot to the resto and vice versa.
Today, of course, I know that there are walkable cities too, I enjoy walking from my Chicago hotel to the office building :-) every single time I enjoy my US visits, but after a couple weeks I can't wait to get back to my 98% car free European life.]]></summary>

Imagine the lavish banquets, gladiatorial bouts, use and abuse of young men and women for the pleasure of the rich, and so much more that characterized the later years of that empire. And none of it seems that far off from the situation we, in these increasingly dis-United States, find ourselves in today. More

I'm kinda new to personal blogging; back in the 2000s I had a tech blog but I wanted everything to index my site. I even submitted my link to a bunch of off brand search engines to get my name out there.
But now there's AI bots scraping websites like iFixit literally a million times a day.
I don't hate AI. I'm not an AI doomer. But that's fucking silly.
Maybe it's just me or maybe Google is terrible these days, but all I could find were blog posts six months old or more that just listed individual scrapers that are probably outdated anyway. So I asked Claude 3.5 to generate me a robots.txt file to block all known AI scrapers and I think it did alright! Here's what I got:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Jeremy here -- I created this project. Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!
I wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).
Frankly, I've enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I'd personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it's got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.
FastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I've now written around a dozen apps with. I'm really loving it!
I hope some of you get a chance to try it out -- let me know what you think.]]></summary>

 The Unione Sindacale Italiana was one of the founding members of the International Workers Association in 1922. Refounded in 1977 after Italy’s “Hot Autumn,” they have been the second-largest and most workplace-focused IWA section for a long time after the Spanish CNT. They have a reputation for avoiding sectarianism, prioritizing solidarity, and maintaining cool heads. Together with the CNT and the German FAU they organized the recent Bilbao Conference of revolutionary unions, and were expelled from the IWA shortly after. [This and all other footnote…]]></summary>

In the part 1 of "Tensors from Scratch" we discussed about what tensors actually are how the shape of a tensor can give us important information about the tensor itself. As a recap:
tensor is an umbrella term for "mathematical objects" or "containers" that have a rank/dimensionality associated with them.
Scalars are rank-0 tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors and so on.
One important property of a tensor is its shape. Shape is defined as: the number of elements p…]]></summary>

 Discretely, almost silently, something is happening which will have serious consequences for the future of the international Anarchist movement: the reorganization of anarcho-syndicalism on a global scope, at the initiative of the CNT. Following the agreements of its XI Congress in 2015, the CNT – together with the German FAU and the Italian USI – has organized an international conference of anarcho-syndicalist and revolutionary unions (November 26–27, Bilbao).

From a Matter of Principle to a Matter of Tactics
 Anarchists who want to take action, when confronted with the choice of tactics, often default to large mass actions, like black bloc. Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Navajo also has a complex phenology [sic], featuring sounds that don’t exist in many other languages. It counts 33 consonants, including affricates and fricatives, and 12 vowels. (By comparison, the English alphabet has 21 and 5, respectively).
Someone else clarified this [0] but got flagged to death for being a bit too harsh, but I do think it's worth mentioning because this is used mistakenly as a prominent example of Navajo's difficulty: the raw numbers of consonants and vowels are not particularly extreme in Navajo, and the numbers that TFA cites for English are wrong.
They seem to have done a relatively simple analysis of the alphabet, but that's not how linguists think about phonology. The alphabet is our way of representing a much more complex system that underlies English, and English's vowel system in particular is far more complex than the alphabet makes it appear.
Our total number of consonants sits at about 24—the alphabet alone would make you forget about some of our affricates (ch as in charge) and some of our fricatives (sh as in shush, zh as in vision, th as in theme, dh as in though), plus a nasal (ng as in ring).
Our vowel system, meanwhile, has anywhere between ~16 in American English to ~25 in Received Pronunciation. Native speakers don't tend to realize just how complicated our vowels are, but getting them wrong is one of the most common ways to get recognized for having an accent.
All told, English has between 40 and 49 phonemes (again, depending on accent), which is quite comparable to Navajo's 45.
I've no doubt that Navajo is harder to learn for most people than English is, but I don't think the phonology plays a big role in that. English's phonology is plenty difficult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To "bear the boredness". (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eriq's entry in my guestbook led me to his recent post, Going from spark to a steady fire. He describes how passions often ignite intensely before rapidly fading away.
I completely resonate with this, just as he did after reading my post I wish I was more dedicated:
It's ridiculous how well that echoes into what I've written above.
Several others have reached out about the same post. One email started with "Dude, that's my life too." The sender described being incredibly invested in a project one week and wanting to abandon it entirely the next.
I've been on the brink of shutting down this blog multiple times, as recently as yesterday. It's hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.
It's living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator. I'm constantly considering pulling the plug. It's like a dragonfly that's been granted several extra lives, but now feels like its luck is running out. It's sneaking around like a cat aware that its nine lives are nearly spent.
It might sound bleak, but it's my reality. I doubt it will ever change. Yet, there's beauty in it too:
I'm not alone.
It becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.
We're not alone.
Blogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community. Keeping a private diary doesn't have the same impact for me.
Blogging is both liberating and inclusive.
I'm not alone. You're not alone.
We have a blogline.]]></summary>

"Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past."

“Danziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study—as well as other self-collected data—and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented—it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He makes a good point about "secret" knowledge, but I don't think that's the real secret.
I believe almost everyone, including the author here, misunderstands what made Minecraft take off.
It was NOT just the fact that you have creative control (which is what most people mistakenly assume is the main point) or that you need to learn how to craft to advance, or the procedural generation. It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!
Without exploring, crafting and building, you can't survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.
And people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.
Pulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn't just lucky. He mastered programming and game design and created a novel experience.]]></summary>

Don't worry, I'm here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let's start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x = 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is "dimensionless" i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

Title: We Want to Be Great Like Our Crime
Subtitle: The Criminal Ego and the Struggle in Society

 On Isabelle Eberhardt's “Criminal” and Renzo Novatore's “Toward the Creative Nothing” 
 Quotes refer to the Eberhardt Press edition and the Venomous Butterfly Publications edition, respectively. 
Crime
 In “Criminal,” Isabelle Eberhardt's memoir of land colonization in Algeria written around the turn of the last century, the farmer Mohammed Achouri cuts an interesting figure. A “tall thin old man with the face of an ascetic, his hard features set in an expression of constant preoccupation”, a quiet character who stands “a bit apart from the others”, he is not a likely hero. Though he stands out, and in fact his inability to fit…]]></summary>

I've started some blog posts here and there but haven't finished them. Or I simply didn't publish them for various reasons.
Instead, I created a few slash pages, experimented with my site design, jotted down a few new ideas, read plenty of blog posts from the discovery feed and emailed with some wonderful Bear bloggers.
And I had a lot of fun doing these things...
At first, it felt weird not to finish and publish any blog posts. It also caused me some anxiety. But blogging should be fun...
For me, Bear Blog is fun.
So instead of thinking too much about writing…
I enjoyed experimenting, reading and socializing on Bear Blog.]]></summary>

To keep myself organised and, because I love paper and all things stationery, I've been a journalist all my life. From writing in little spiral-bound notebooks and school exercise books as a child, right on through to a fancy leather-bound Midori (an expensive Japanese notebook) that was a birthday gift. I've been an avid note-maker since I was able to hold a pencil and write.
I've used all sorts of notebooks to scribble in, and even tried the made for journaling journal by Baron Fig—yes, what a great name!
