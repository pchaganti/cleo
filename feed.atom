        <link href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/#atom-everything"/>
        <updated>2025-05-16T19:12:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/codex">OpenAI Codex</a></strong></p>
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/">Announced today</a>, here's the documentation for OpenAI's "cloud-based software engineering agent". It's not yet available for us $20/month Plus customers ("coming soon") but if you're a $200/month Pro user you can try it out now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a high level, you specify a prompt, and the agent goes to work in its own environment. After about 8–10 minutes, the agent gives you back a diff.</p>
<p>You can execute prompts in either <em>ask</em> mode or <em>code</em> mode. When you select <em>ask</em>, Codex clones a read-only version of your repo, booting faster and giving you follow-up tasks. <em>Code</em> mode, however, creates a full-fledged environment that the agent can run and test against.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/openaidevs/status/1923492740526112819">4 minute demo video</a> is a useful overview. One note that caught my eye is that the setup phase for an environment can pull from the internet (to install necessary dependencies) but the agent loop itself still runs in a network disconnected sandbox.</p>
<p>It sounds similar to GitHub's own <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Copilot Workspace</a> project, which can compose PRs against your code based on a prompt. The big difference is that Codex incorporates a full Code Interpeter style environment, allowing it to build and run the code it's creating and execute tests in a loop.</p>
<p>Copilot Workspaces has a level of integration with Codespaces but still requires manual intervention to help exercise the code.</p>
<p>Also similar to Copilot Workspaces is a confusing  name. OpenAI now have <em>four</em> products called Codex:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/codex/">OpenAI Codex</a>, announced today.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a>, a completely different coding assistant tool they released a few weeks ago that is the same kind of shape as <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>. This one owns the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">openai/codex</a> namespace on GitHub.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/codex-mini-latest">codex-mini</a>, a brand new model released today that is used by their Codex product. It's a fine-tuned o4-mini variant. I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin/releases/tag/0.4">llm-openai-plugin 0.4</a> adding support for that model.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230203201912/https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/">OpenAI Codex (2021)</a> - Internet Archive link, OpenAI's first specialist coding model from the GPT-3 era. This was used by the original GitHub Copilot and is still the current topic of Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex">OpenAI Codex</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite thing about this most recent Codex product is that OpenAI shared <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex-universal/blob/main/Dockerfile">the full Dockerfile</a> for the environment that the system uses to run code - in <code>openai/codex-universal</code> on GitHub because <code>openai/codex</code> was taken already.</p>
<p>This is extremely useful documentation for figuring out how to use this thing - I'm glad they're making this as transparent as possible.

It’s been about two months since Israel cut off all food and water to Gaza. There were storehouses and some food, and it took about 30-40 days to exhaust the stores, but even before that there wasn’t enough.
And even before this cut-off there wasn’t enough. There was a brief period after Trump took power with supplies moving in in large amounts, but since the start of the crisis, Israel has been choking off food, medicine and everything else, and Israeli citizens have stopped and hijacked aid trucks.
So there aren’t any fat people in Gaza, except for some Zionist genociders who cosplay as sol…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting elites attention

What the right wants from its followers is for them to be riven by hatred of any difference, thus making them easy to manipulate and willing to sell out their economic values in exchange for seeing brown people beaten, and women and trans people losing control over their own bodies.
What neoliberals want is for their followers to be convinced that each group, even each micro group, is on its own, unable to understand each other and thus that solidarity is impossible and all one can hope for is that some member of the identity group is allowed to join the elite, while most of all groups remain in poverty.
They’re very similar, really. In both cases hatred of other groups is inculcated as the core value, as a way of making manipulation easy and avoiding having to actually deal with broad issues of well being.
Both of these are variations on “divide and conquer”. It costs a lot less to give a few people something than to give many people something. “Want some women and minorities in power? Sure. Costs us almost nothing.”
“Want women to be forced to bear rape children and die in pregnancy due to lack of necessary abortions? Sure, costs us nothing. Our women can still get abortions.
“Want trans people excluded and denied health care? Sure, they’re a tiny part of the population and rich trans people will be fine.”
On the other hand giving everyone healthcare would cut a lot of profits. Giving everyone a liveable wage or assistance to those who can’t work or find jobs: that would cost a lot of profits.
“You can have anything you want, as long as it doesn’t make elites poorer.”
On that the right and center are unified.

        <link href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/annotated-presentation-creator/#atom-everything"/>
        <updated>2025-05-15T14:41:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations">Annotated Presentation Creator</a></strong></p>
I've released a new version of my tool for creating annotated presentations. I use this to turn slides from my talks into <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/">posts like this one</a> - here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">a bunch more examples</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote the first version <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">in August 2023</a> making extensive use of ChatGPT and GPT-4. That older version can <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations">still be seen here</a>.</p>
<p>This new edition is a design refresh using Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking). I ran this command:</p>
<pre><code>llm \
  -f https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations \
  -s 'Improve this tool by making it respnonsive for mobile, improving the styling' \
  -m claude-3.7-sonnet -o thinking 1
</code></pre>
<p>That uses <code>-f</code> to fetch the original HTML (which has embedded CSS and JavaScript in a single page, convenient for working with LLMs) as a prompt fragment, then applies the system prompt instructions "Improve this tool by making it respnonsive for mobile, improving the styling" (typo included).</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8010fca527eb588f006f70850d7c37a3">the full transcript</a> (generated using <code>llm logs -cue</code>) and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/70e1bdbf71fd53ba89922067d3401a3b/revisions#diff-b6337e5018b8ad3d751d42ddc4bc6c1a0328190c7e7cbfeb88321142aad8f31d">a diff</a> illustrating the changes. Total cost 10.7781 cents.</p>
<p>There was one visual glitch: the slides were distorted like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The slide is distorted by being too high for its width" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/bug.jpg" /></p>
<p>I decided to try o4-mini to see if it could spot the problem (after <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1037">fixing this LLM bug</a>):</p>
<pre><code>llm o4-mini \
  -a bug.png \
  -f https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations \
  -s 'Suggest a minimal fix for this distorted image'
</code></pre>
<p>It suggested adding <code>align-items: flex-start;</code> to my <code>.bundle</code> class (it quoted the <code>@media (min-width: 768px)</code> bit but the solution was to add it to <code>.bundle</code> at the top level), which fixed the bug.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an &quot;Annotated Presentation Creator&quot; web application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I presented a three hour workshop at PyCon US yesterday titled <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/25/">Building software on top of Large Language Models</a>. The goal of the workshop was to give participants everything they needed to get started writing code that makes use of LLMs.</p>
<p>Most of the workshop was interactive: I created a detailed handout with six different exercises, then worked through them with the participants. You can  <a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/">access the handout here</a> - it should be comprehensive enough that you can follow along even without having been present in the room.</p>
<p>Here's the table of contents for the handout:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html">Setup</a> - getting LLM and related tools installed and configured for accessing the OpenAI API</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prompting.html">Prompting with LLM</a> - basic prompting in the terminal, including accessing logs of past prompts and responses</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prompting-python.html">Prompting from Python</a> - how to use LLM's Python API to run prompts against different models from Python code</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text-to-sql.html">Building a text to SQL tool</a> - the first building exercise: prototype a text to SQL tool with the LLM command-line app, then turn that into Python code.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structured-data-extraction.html">Structured data extraction</a> - possibly the most economically valuable application of LLMs today</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semantic-search-and-rag.html">Semantic search and RAG</a> - working with embeddings, building a semantic search engine</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html">Tool usage</a> - the most important technique for building interesting applications on top of LLMs. My LLM tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/">gained tool usage</a> in an alpha release just the night before the workshop!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sections of the workshop involved me talking and showing slides. I've gathered those together into an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">annotated presentation</a> below.</p>
<p>The workshop was not recorded, but hopefully these materials can provide a useful substitute. If you'd like me to present a private version of this workshop for your own team please <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/#llm-tutorial-intro.032.jpeg">get in touch</a>!</p>

  <p>If you have limited attention, I think these are the three to focus on.</p>
<p>OpenAI created the space and are still innovating on a regular basis - their GPT 4.1 family is just a month old and is currently one of my favourite balances of power to cost. o4-mini is an excellent reasoning model, especially for its price.</p>
<p>Gemini started producing truly outstanding models with the 1.5 series, and 2.5 may be the best available models for a wide range of purposes.</p>
<p>Anthropic's Claude has long been one of my favourite models. I'm looking forward to their next update.</p>

  <p>There are a wide range of "open weights" (usually a more accurate term than "open source") models available, and they've been getting <em>really</em> good over the past six months.

  <p>These models can "see" now - their vision input has gotten really good. The Gemini family can handle audio and video input too.</p>
<p>We're beginning to see audio and image output start to emerge - OpenAI have been a leader here, but Gemini offers this too and other providers are clearly working in the same direction. Qwen have an open weights model for this, <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Omni">Qwen 2.5 Omni</a> (audio output).</p>

  <p>... there are some expensive models too! The same 70,000 images through GPT-4.5, priced at $75/million input tokens, would cost at least $2,400.</p>

  <p>I've heard from sources I trust that Gemini and AWS (for their Nova series, priced similar to Gemini models) are not charging less per prompt than the energy it costs to serve them.</p>
<p>This makes the prompt pricing one of the better signals we have as to the environmental impact of running those prompts.</p>
<p>I've seen <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-cheat-sheet-for-conversations-about">estimates</a> that training costs, amortized over time, likely add 10-15% to that cost - so it's still a good hint at the overall energy usage.</p>

  <p>My recommendation is to try them out. Keep throwing things at them, including things you're sure they won't be able to handle. Their failure patterns offer useful lessons.</p>
<p>If a model can't do something it's good to tuck that away and try it again in six months - you may find that the latest generation of models can solve a new problem for you.</p>
<p>As the author of an abstraction toolkit across multiple models (<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) I'm biased towards arguing it's good to be able to switch between them, but I genuinely believe it's a big advantage to be able to do so.</p>

  <p>This is also a key method for implementing <strong>semantic search</strong> - search which returns documents that are related to the user's search term even if none of the keywords were an exact match.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to embed the user's search term and find similar documents - but this doesn't always work great, since a short question might not end up in the same location as a much longer article.</p>
<p>There are neat tricks here that can help.</p>
<p>Some models allow you to embed questions and answers in different ways that cause them to end up closer to each other. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/12/nomic-embed-text-v2/">Nomic Embed Text v2</a> is a recent example.</p>
<p>A neat trick is you can ask an LLM to entirely synthesize a potential answer to the user's question - then embed that artificial answer and find your own content that's nearby in vector space!</p>
<p>We worked through the next section of the workshop together:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semantic-search-and-rag.html">Semantic search and RAG</a></strong> - we gathered embeddings for Python PEPs and built a semantic search engine against them using LLM's command-line utilities and a Bash script.</p>
<p>I described RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation - the pattern where you try to find documentsv relevant to the user's question and dump those into the prompt.</p>
<p>I emphasized that RAG doesn't <em>have</em> to use embeddings: you can build a great RAG system on top of full-text keyword-based search as well. You can also combine the two in a hybrid search system.</p>
<p>I argued that every time a new long context model comes out people inevitably argue that "RAG is dead". I don't think long context will ever kill RAG - no matter how long your context you'll still have more data than can fit in it. But I do think that LLM tool calling for search, especially <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">as demonstrated by o3 and o4-mini</a>, is a better approach than classic RAG where you try once to find relevant documents and then attempt to answer the question without looping.</p>
<p>The next section of the workshop had no slides but is the section I was most excited about: <strong><a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#tools">tool usage</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I talked through the pattern where LLMs can call tools and introduced the brand new tool functionality I added to LLM <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/">in the latest alpha release</a>.</p>

  <p>Evals are the LLM equivalent of unit tests: automated tests that help you tell how well your system is working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately LLMs are non-deterministic, so traditional unit tests don't really work.</p>
<p>If you're lucky you might be able to develop a suite of questions that can be evaluated on correct or incorrect answers - examples of emails that should be flagged as spam, for example.</p>
<p>More creative tasks are harder to evaluate. How can you tell if your LLM system that creates vegetarian cheesecake recipes is doing a good job? Or more importantly if tweaks you made to the prompt cause it to do a <em>better</em> or <em>worse</em> job?</p>
<p>LLM as a judge is a pattern that can help here - carefully prompting an LLM during your evaluation runs to help decide if an answer is better.</p>
<p>This whole area continues to be one of the hardest to crack - but also one of the most valuable. Having a great eval suite for your own application domain is a huge competitive advantage - it means you can adopt more models and iterate on your prompts with much more confidence.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stumbled on this chart recently:

Kind of tells its own story.
It’s worth reading the Communist manifest. People have weird ideas about it, but a lot of it is really unexceptionable. For example, Marx and Engels demanded pensions for old folks.
Capitalists looked at this and said, “oh, we can do this if the alternative is worse” and introduced them. Someone as hard headed as Bismarck responded this way.
The threat of a credible enemy ideology which treats ordinary people better than capitalists do forces capitalists to change. For a long time we haven’t had that, but the single party “Marxist but with capitalism” CCP offers another, and yes, they do, overall treat their workers better, as well as being better at capitalism than capitalists. No one is as obsessed with how markets actually work as Marxist economists.
Let’s look at another of my favorite charts:

Oh hey, having powerful organizations taking the part of workers matters.
Something happened right after Reagan took power:

Strikes involving more than 1,000 workers

Then there’s this:

(The numbers have gone down since then, but are still vastly high, and far, far higher than China.
Break the unions and lock up the people who won’t obey bullshit (aka. drug) laws.
Class war is real, and constantly ongoing, and elites have won that war.
Power and fear is all that capitalists ever respond to.
Always remember that.

It's only an alpha so I'm not going to promote this extensively yet, but my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> project just grew a feature I've been working towards for nearly two years now: <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/tools.html">tool support</a>!</p>
<p>I'm presenting a workshop about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/building-with-llms-pycon-2025">Building software on top of Large Language Models</a> at PyCon US tomorrow and this was the one feature I really needed to pull everything else together.</p>
<p>Tools can be used from the command-line like this (inspired by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#defining-custom-sql-functions">sqlite-utils --functions</a>):</p>
<pre>llm --functions <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
<span class="pl-s">def multiply(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    """Multiply two numbers."""</span>
<span class="pl-s">    return x * y</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>what is 34234 * 213345<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m o4-mini</pre>

<p>You can add <code>--tools-debug</code> (shortcut: <code>--td</code>) to have it show exactly what tools are being executed and what came back. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/usage.html#usage-tools">More documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>It's also available <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/python-api.html#tools">in the Python library</a>:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>

<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">multiply</span>(<span class="pl-s1">x</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>, <span class="pl-s1">y</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>) <span class="pl-c1">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">int</span>:
    <span class="pl-s">"""Multiply two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-s1">x</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-s1">y</span>

<span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_model</span>(<span class="pl-s">"gpt-4.1-mini"</span>)
<span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">chain</span>(
    <span class="pl-s">"What is 34234 * 213345?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">tools</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">multiply</span>]
)
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">response</span>.<span class="pl-c1">text</span>())</pre>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-tools-register">new plugin hook</a> so plugins can register tools that can then be referenced by name using <code>llm --tool name_of_tool "prompt"</code>.</p>
<p>There's still <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/milestone/12">a bunch I want to do</a> before including this in a stable release, most notably adding support for Python asyncio. It's a pretty exciting start though!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.16a0">llm-anthropic 0.16a0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.20a0">llm-gemini 0.20a0</a> add tool support for Anthropic and Gemini models, depending on the new LLM alpha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images">Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images</a></strong></p>
Gergely Orosz landed a fantastic deep dive interview with OpenAI's Sulman Choudhry (head of engineering, ChatGPT) and Srinivas Narayanan (VP of engineering, OpenAI) to talk about the launch back in March of ChatGPT images - their new image generation mode built on top of multi-modal GPT-4o.</p>
<p>The feature kept on having new viral spikes, including one that added one million new users in a single hour. They signed up 100 million new users in the first week after the feature's launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this vertical growth spike started, most of our engineering teams didn't believe it. They assumed there must be something wrong with the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the hood the infrastructure is mostly Python and <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi">FastAPI</a>! I hope they're sponsoring those projects (and <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette">Starlette</a>, which is used by FastAPI under the hood.)</p>
<p>They're also using some C, and <a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> as a workflow engine. They addressed the early scaling challenge by adding an asynchronous queue to defer the load for their free users (resulting in longer generation times) at peak demand.</p>
<p>There are plenty more details tucked away behind the firewall, including an exclusive I've not been able to find anywhere else: OpenAI's core engineering principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ship relentlessly</strong> - move quickly and continuously improve, without waiting for perfect conditions</li>
<li><strong>Own the outcome</strong> - take full responsibility for products, end-to-end</li>
<li><strong>Follow through</strong> - finish what is started and ensure the work lands fully</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried getting o4-mini-high to track down a copy of those principles online and was delighted to see it either leak or hallucinate the URL to OpenAI's internal engineering handbook!</p>
<p><img alt="Thought for 1m 48s:  Here are the two places where OpenAl's “Ship  relentlessly — Own the outcome — Follow through”  checklist shows up as its core engineering  principles:  1. OpenAl Careers =&gt; Operating Principles  On the Careers page under &quot;Operating Principles,”  OpenAl codifies how every team—and especially  engineering—works together. While the page itself  doesn’t list the bullets verbatim, it's the umbrella  under which these three behavioural norms sit (Ship  relentlessly, Own the outcome, Follow through).  2. OpenAl Internal Engineering Handbook  These three tenets are drawn straight from OpenAl's  internal Engineering Handbook (employee-only), at: https://handbook.openai.com/engineering/principles  (This handbook page isn't publicly crawlable, but it's  the definitive source for how OpenAl's engineers  actually organize their day-to-day work.)" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/openai-handbook.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gergely has a whole series of posts like this called <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/real-world-engineering-challenges">Real World Engineering Challenges</a>, including another one <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt">on ChatGPT a year ago</a>.

Then there’s this lovely chart:

Well, well, well. Seems forcing people to do what they don’t want to do, in what is usually a socially oppressive environment, is bad for them.
There are, of course, those who thrive in school, and love it, usually the socially dominant kids. But for a lot of kids, school is Hell.
This has a lot to do with alignment of goals, I think. I wrote recently about the epidemic of AI cheating and how to avoid it, but I think the smartest commentary I’ve seen on AI cheating, and cheating in general is this one:

The Beginning of the End of the AI Upsell?</a></strong></p>
Jason Lemkin highlighting a potential new trend in the pricing of AI-enhanced SaaS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can SaaS and B2B vendors really charge even more for AI … when it’s become core?  And we’re already paying $15-$200 a month for a seat? [...]</p>
<p>You can try to charge more, but if the competition isn’t — you’re going to likely lose.  And if it’s core to the product itself … can you really charge more ultimately?  Probably … not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's impressive how quickly LLM-powered features are going from being part of the top tier premium plans to almost an expected part of most per-seat software.

<p>So much has happened! I'm particularly excited about the range of small open weight vision models that are now available. Models like gemma3-4b-it and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct produce very impressive results and run happily on mid-range consumer hardware.

<p><strong>Correctness and security</strong>: Even when code generated by AI tools does seem to function, there is no guarantee that it is correct, and no indication of what security implications it may have.

Note that China got what they wanted, minus 10%—no negotiations until the tariffs are removed.
There will still be a two month trade burp. Ships weren’t leaving China for the US at all, literally zero. Lot of freight companies are about to make a mint, though. So expect some shortages, but nothing worse than Covid, and hopefully lasting less time.
The fundamental problem remains, however, which is that there’s no certainty around any of this, so business people can’t make long term plans, including plans to build or relocate manufacturing. Trump and the US can’t be trusted to stay steady on policy, so avoiding making big plans involving the US makes sense.
The Great Power picture is clearer, however. The US tried to impose its will on China and failed. China wouldn’t negotiate till its pre-conditions were met. The world has two great powers, with the EU bidding to become the third (I think they’ll fail, but that’s what the rearmament is about.)
And, in economic terms, China is by far the pre-eminent great power. It isn’t even close. The era of American hegemony is officially over. The US tried to impose its will on the world and failed.

So, the Europeans have said that Russia must grant an unconditional 30 day ceasefire, or they’ll ramp up aid to Ukraine and put on more sanctions, including some against Nord Stream II. They claim Trump is onside, but Trump hasn’t confirmed this.
The Russians have indicated willingness for a thirty day ceasefire, but they have a condition: for those thirty days, weapon shipments from the West to Ukraine must stop and Putin has straight up rejected the unconditional ceasefire.
What a surprise.
What Europeans want is for Russia, which is winning on the ground, to give them thirty days to rearm Ukraine. Can’t imagine why Russia won’t go for that.
The Euros are delusional. They have no leverage. They’ve already said they intend to end all energy purchases from Russia …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security">Cursor: Security</a></strong></p>
Cursor's security documentation page includes a surprising amount of detail about how the Cursor text editor's backend systems work.</p>
<p>I've recently learned that checking an organization's list of documented subprocessors is a great way to get a feel for how everything works under the hood - it's a loose "view source" for their infrastructure! That was how I confirmed that Anthropic's search features <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/">used Brave search</a> back in March.</p>
<p>Cursor's list includes AWS, Azure and GCP (AWS for primary infrastructure, Azure and GCP for "some secondary infrastructure"). They host their own custom models on <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks</a> and make API calls out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and xAI depending on user preferences. They're using <a href="https://turbopuffer.com/">turbopuffer</a> as a hosted vector store.</p>
<p>The most interesting section is about <a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security#codebase-indexing">codebase indexing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursor allows you to semantically index your codebase, which allows it to answer questions with the context of all of your code as well as write better code by referencing existing implementations. […]</p>
<p>At our server, we chunk and embed the files, and store the embeddings in Turbopuffer. To allow filtering vector search results by file path, we store with every vector an obfuscated relative file path, as well as the line range the chunk corresponds to. We also store the embedding in a cache in AWS, indexed by the hash of the chunk, to ensure that indexing the same codebase a second time is much faster (which is particularly useful for teams).</p>
<p>At inference time, we compute an embedding, let Turbopuffer do the nearest neighbor search, send back the obfuscated file path and line range to the client, and read those file chunks on the client locally. We then send those chunks back up to the server to answer the user’s question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When operating in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/security#privacy-mode-guarantee">privacy mode</a> - which they say is enabled by 50% of their users - they are careful not to store any raw code on their servers for longer than the duration of a single request. This is why they store the embeddings and obfuscated file paths but not the code itself.</p>
<p>Reading this made me instantly think of the paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/8/text-embeddings-reveal-almost-as-much-as-text/">Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text</a> about how vector embeddings can be reversed. The security documentation touches on that in the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding reversal: academic work has shown that reversing embeddings is possible in some cases. Current attacks rely on having access to the model and embedding short strings into big vectors, which makes us believe that the attack would be somewhat difficult to do here. That said, it is definitely possible for an adversary who breaks into our vector database to learn things about the indexed codebases.</p>

“For the first time in my memory, foreign investors are not only fleeing U.S. equities but are fleeing U.S. Treasuries.
