It makes a tiny minority indecently richer while leaving the majority in the lurch. Women and minorities such as indigenous peoples, LGBTQIA+ or racialized people are badly hit by those inequalities. In a situation in which famine and extreme poverty keep increasing, the withdrawal of the State further feeds the vicious circle of poverty and inequality. (...)

Given ongoing uncertainty in Ukraine and the Middle East, this seems an opportune moment to revisit the conventional wisdom about the relationship between inflation and wages: if an unexpected increase in energy costs drives up the cost of living, will workers demand higher wages, reversing the recent moderation in wage growth?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's 2 genders, right? We all know that.
Of course there is. You're either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you're a woman without said dangly bits.
But maybe there's more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn't feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it's the opposite? Or something in between?
Honestly, I don't give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I'll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.
Look, it's a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We've been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there's been 2 genders. Male and female.
But in the last few decades there's been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as "him" don't get up on your high horse and start screaming "YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!"
I assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that's fine. Tell me politely and I'll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.
Irony is, if you're not a dick about the whole thing, you're far more likely to get people on-side. You're always gonna get bigoted wankers, that's par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn't make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.
It just makes them human.

Auto loans saw a $9 billion increase, continuing their steady growth since the second quarter of 2020, while balances on other non-housing debts fell. Credit card balances fell by $14 billion, which is typical for the first quarter. However, an increasing number of borrowers are behind on credit card payments.

Working on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don't like inking, I half-ass shapes I don't understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don't really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing.

I don’t know if this is because of the air quality here or because I’m actually getting sick, but I’m desperately hoping it’s not the latter.

(Something about all the sugar in it makes it hard for your body to absorb the Vitamin C, if I remember correctly.)
Traveling and getting sick go hand in hand for me. It’s as if arriving somewhere new triggers my immune system to self-immolate. When I visited New York in 2021 I lost my voice after a few days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never really thought about it while growing up because I was raised in a religious family anyway and it's just how I was used to people talking, but at this point I've been living in Japan for several years and I often notice that very normal phrases take on a religious persona when translated to English. For example we have this word yokatta which literally translates as "it was good", but if you were to translate it normally to English as it's used than it would come out as "thank God". Or we have this other word kotoka which would be translated as "God knows" like "God only knows how bored I am" (なんて暇なことか). Also a lot of words in English are shortened versions of old phrases with religious significance like "Goodbye" coming from "God be with ye", and a lot of set phrases or common expressions in English that people use all the time come straight from the Bible like "a drop in the bucket", "go the extra mile", "by the skin of your teeth", "the root of the matter", "a labor of love", "scapegoat", "broken heart", "eye for an eye", "rise and shine", "fall by the wayside", or "a wolf in sheep's clothing"
I'm not suggesting that it's a bad thing (and I don't think it is), and Japanese has a lot of similar words or phrases which come from a religious origin too. It's just kinda weird to notice in retrospect how in English-speaking countries everything is experienced through a Judeo-Christian lens, even if you're an atheist.
Maybe that's why Western society and Japanese society are so different. Or partly why, anyway.]]></summary>

I decided several years ago that I’m not buying another iPad until this is sorted out by iPadOS.
I think of iPhones as personal devices, where each person may have their own. But iPads are more likely to be shared for personal use in families. The fact that each person using it cannot have their own user profiles, app data, etc., is a huge drawback. Apple has supported this for a long time (though probably not in the best way) for education, but it’s not available to others. Even tvOS supports switching between user profiles quickly.
Apple enforcing the idea that iPad (with iPadOS) should also be a personal device — one device per person — makes the user experience quite poor.]]></summary>

It's glib to dismiss safety concerns because we haven't all turned into paperclips yet. LLMs and image gen models are having real effects now.
We're already at a point where AI can generate text and images that will fool a lot of people a lot of the time. For every college-educated young person smugly pointing out that they aren't fooled by an image with six-fingered hands, there are far more people who had marginal media literacy to begin with and are now almost defenceless against a tidal wave of hyper-scaleable deception.
We're already at a point where we're counselling elders to ignore late-night messages from people claiming to be a relative in need of an urgent wire transfer. What defences do we have when an LLM will be able to have a completely fluent, natural-sounding conversation in someone else's voice? I'm not confident that I'd be able to distinguish GPT-4o from a human speaker in the best of circumstances and I'm almost certain that I could be fooled if I'm hurried, distracted, sleep deprived or otherwise impaired.
Regardless of any future impacts on the labour market or any hypothesised X-risks, I think we should be very worried about the immediate risks to trust and social cohesion. An awful lot of people are turning into paranoid weirdos at the moment and I don't particularly blame them, but I can see things getting seriously ugly if we can't abate that trend.]]></summary>

Do you remember when they teased GPT-2 as "too dangerous" for public access? I do. Yet we now have Llama 3 in the wild, which even at the smaller 8B size is about as powerful as the [edit: 6/13/23] GPT-4 release.

I don't really care whether it's stronger than gpt-4-turbo or not. The direct real-time video and audio capabilities are absolutely magical and stunning. The responses in voice mode are now instantaneous, you can interrupt the model, you can talk to it while showing it a video, and it understands (and uses) intonation and emotion.
Really, just watch the live demo. I linked directly to where it starts.
Importantly, this makes the interaction a lot more "human-like".

They will point out that we're reaping diminishing returns from Transformers. They will question the absence of a "GPT-5" model. And so on -- blah, blah, blah, stochastic parrots, blah, blah, blah.
Ignore the critics. Watch the demos. Play with it.
This stuff feels magical. Magical. It makes the movie "Her" look like it's no longer in the realm of science fiction but in the realm of incremental product development. HAL's unemotional monotone in Kubrick's movie, "Space Odyssey," feels... oddly primitive by comparison. I'm impressed at how well this works.
Well-deserved congratulations to everyone at OpenAI!]]></summary>

choice, import, and scissors, although i'll cut some of the younger ones slack on scissors. 

something else i find pretty funny is that occasionally they'll try to touch the screen on the desktop to navigate. 

and this is all coming from an area where many of the school districts are top in the nation. 

did you also know that kids nowadays are more susceptible to online scams and malware? 

and overall, kids throughout the nation are reading at a significantly lower level than they should be, even with schooling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It brings to mind the story of how when Boris Yeltsin was visiting the US, he took an impromptu detour to a random American supermarket to try to catch them off guard, only to be blown away that Americans really did have supermarkets everywhere practically overflowing with food. The story goes that the experience played a big role in shaping his vision for Russia when he went on to become its first freely elected leader a few years later.

Or similarly there's the story of the Lykov family, who lived life cut off from humanity for 40 years but still somewhat understood what the new, moving "stars" in the night sky must be: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/for-40-years-this-rus...

Almost two weeks ago, I wrote about catching a crawfish in the pond near Jiaozi Park, not far from where I live. My wife and I weren't sure what to do - whether we should put it back or keep it. Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.
I'm happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We've noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It's no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we're nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.
We're trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well. I'll provide more updates as things progress.]]></summary>

Thus, Washington's "sudden" distancing of itself from the Netanyahu government, which followed (or perhaps...preceded) Hamas' acceptance of the Qatar-Egypt peace plan, is mainly attributed to the asphyxiating pressure exerted on President Biden and the world superpower establishment by the American student movement in solidarity with the Palestinian people.r More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, over a decade ago now, I was a .Net developer. Microsoft introduced Entity Framework, their new way of handling data in .Net applications. Promises made, promises believed, we all used it. I was especially glad of Lazy Loading, where I didn't have to load data from the database into my memory structures; the system would do that automatically. I could write my code as if all my memory structures were populated and not worry about it. Except, it didn't work consistently. Every now and again a memory structure would not be populated, for no apparent reason. Digging deep into technet, I found a small note saying "if this happens, then you can check whether the data has been loaded by checking the value of this flag and manually loading it if necessary" [0]. So, in other words, I have to manually load all my data because I can't trust EF to do it for me. [1]
Long analogy short, this is where I think AI for coding is now. It gets things wrong enough that I have to manually check everything it does and correct it, to the point where I might as well just do it myself in the first place. This might not always be the case, but that's where I feel it is right now.
[0] Entity Framework has moved on a lot since then, and apparently now can be trusted to lazily load data. I don't know because...

Essentially, the model was artificially adding landmarks and details based on its training set when the real image quality was too poor to make out details.
Needless to say, AI upscaling as described in this article would be a nightmare for radiologists. 90% of radiology is confirming the absence of disease when image quality is high, and asking for complementary studies when image quality is low. With AI enhanced images that look "normal", how can the radiologist ever say "I can confirm there is no brain bleed" when the computer might be incorrectly adding "normal" details when compensating for poor image quality?

I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that's how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I'd rather delve into a character's life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that's what I prefer.
Book length doesn't bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I'm sure they'll evolve as I read more.
For now, I'm sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I'm reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It's packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I've breezed through about ten chapters and I'm already in love with it! 🫶]]></summary>

Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the GA release of Gateway API last October, Kubernetes
