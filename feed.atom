        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin
I tell myself that I blog for my own sake.
I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection.
I publish essays because it helps me tame my thinking.
And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.
I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats.
I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: expenses, books, movies, runs, etc.
Views and upvotes...
..just another metric to follow, a survey on whether anyone's reading.
A measure of... something I'm not sure anymore.
Writing has been my outlet, a habit I’ve had an on-off relationship with over the years.
In all my reasons for writing, I mostly write for myself.
I agree with Mr. Godin -- writing is clarifying, motivating and fun, even if no one's reading.
But I'll admit, it feels good knowing someone else is out there nodding along, connecting to a piece I've shared.
Imagining that somewhere, a stranger reads my words in their own quiet corner, maybe in pajamas, maybe over coffee, and smiles, resonates, or even feels a spark of recognition.
To me, that’s inspiring.
So, even if nobody reads my blog, the act of sharing still matters.
My writing is still deeply personal, a habit of expression and reflection.
And if, by chance, someone wanders in this corner of the web, that connection — however fleeting — is simply a bonus.]]></summary>

The number was depressed both by the effects of the hurricanes that hit the South last month and the loss of roughly 33,000 jobs due to the strike at Boeing.

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yet another Bear blog appreciation post.
I discovered Bear in 2023 through a Google search for minimal blogging platforms. Today, 379 days later, Bear has integrated into my routine.
I publish frequently without any pressure on the quality of my content. I write about whatever random things come to mind.
I programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.
I also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.
On rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.
Beyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.
After a year, Bear still feels like a great fit. Herman has created the perfect blogging experience that feels fluid with my digital habits.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to never share how I really felt, not even with my closest friends. Blogging about it would have been completely unthinkable.
On the outside, everything looked peaceful and happy. No problems here! But deep down, I felt terrible.
When I finally realized the seriousness of it and sought help, a whole new world opened up for me. I realized that I was far from alone in feeling this way. Suddenly, it no longer felt wrong or shameful, but human and understandable.
Nowadays, I'm open about both my past and during periods when I'm feeling down. I feel like it helps me, and actually others too. It creates a comforting sense of belonging and a realization that we humans are quite similar after all.
We're only human...
It's liberating to talk or write about it, it's valuable for our fellow human beings, and we can get strengthening and motivating support. A wonderful example of this is the lovely comments I received in the guestbook and on Mastodon after yesterday's post, Daunting Doubts. Thank you everyone!
I'm not saying everything is appropriate to share. I'm also not saying that you should force yourself to be open. But sharing that human "ugly and embarrassing" stuff we try to hide, I think that's very healthy and valuable.
So next time you feel lost, share your shit!]]></summary>

Clinton’s war was premeditated, our transit to the World Wide Web was reluctant, at best. Alexander Cockburn’s relationship with computers was hostile. Mine was indifferent. I surfed the web, like anyone else, but had no idea how it would be useful for us. At the time, CounterPunch was a 6-page newsletter that we published fortnightly. We called it “fortnightly” because the word had a nice ring to it and no one was precisely sure how many days or even weeks a fortnight encompassed. But if we ran pieces online, who would pay to receive our newsletter? We remained stubbornly committed to print and our 5,000 or so subscribers. Where will the web be when the electromagnetic pulse wipes the slate clean? More

The biggest thing to me, however, is the categories chosen & what seems very noticeably omitted... Soundtracks are nowhere to be found.

I was generally kind of weird and bad at conversations.

I couldn't disagree more. The point of a strike is to demonstrate the value of your labor by withholding it. Withholding your labor in a slow week would be counterproductive. Strikes (just like any effective form of protest) are supposed to be inconvenient, so in saying what you said, you're really just expressing you don't like strikes. Having this blow up in election week is a risk the Times knowingly took in not meeting their workers' needs sufficiently, and drawing out the negotiations as long as they have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personally - just let the developer own the machine they use for development.
If you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.
I have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.
Yes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).
Yes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).
Yes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.
---
The only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.
If you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era marked by unprecedented threats to democracy from rising authoritarian forces, universities—once celebrated citadels of democratic learning and public service—now find themselves caught in a profound political and ideological siege. Rather than championing social justice or fostering spaces for rigorous intellectual exchange, many institutions have shifted their priorities to profit, silencing dissent and embracing market-driven models that serve a predatory capitalism, thus betraying their democratic mission. This crisis has deep roots, but the recent onslaught by far-right politicians and a reactionary billionaire elite is without precedent in its intensity and scale. This trend weakens the humanities and liberal arts, stripping higher education of its capacity to serve as a democratic public sphere and robbing it of the potential to cultivate socially aware students who challenge injustices and hold power to account. Increasingly, higher education runs the risk of becoming either right wing indoctrination centers or dead zones of the imagination. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[>> [Why not build programmer performance measurement tooling?] It's the job of a manager to know what their reports are up to, and whether they're doing a good job of it, and are generally effective. If they can't do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.
Agreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart's law. [0]
In the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.
Consequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won't use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They'll only use those dashboards.
Which then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.
Helping a colleague doesn't show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn't on the sprint board? Fuck that.
Which is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.
And then, because this is the work reality you've created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you're left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a decent amount of cynicism in the comments, which I understand. I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.
Historically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).
The last couple of decades we've seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).
This mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.
The method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.
The whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.]]></summary>

Some of you may think this is a harsh stance to take. Some of you would be wrong.
I have friends still chained to the demon-site formerly known as Twitter1 and I keep hearing them complain about how the internet is so mean and angry, how everyone just posts bait to piss people off and don't meaningfully engage with eachother. Unfortunately, this is the way much of the modern internet is, and not due to any malicious intent: Websites that are free need to serve you ads, and the more ads the better.

they’re mostly self portraits.
his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.
sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.

linus-malmqvist
a couple of things inspire me:
along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.
ex:
18 September 2024 
Onsdag

The logs arrive, I can now start building my house. 

the other thing that encourages me creatively is that he’s been doing this project since 2008. that’s a long time. It astounds me that more people aren’t liking his drawings.
the number of likes on his work doesn’t seem to faze him.
he just continues drawing, sharing his work, and not making things more complicated than they need to be.
he loves to draw, so he does it.]]></summary>

bear.css.observer takes any subdomain from subdomain.bearblog.dev and splits the screen into two panels. On the left is a live preview of the blog content. On the right is an editor where you can tweak the CSS in real-time. As you type, the changes are instantly applied to the preview panel on the left.
To make things more user-friendly, I included some themes that users can select from a dropdown menu. This allows for quick testing of different looks and formatting options without writing CSS from scratch. Submit your theme here.
Once you're happy with the styling, you will have a couple options. You can click a button to save the style sheet to localStorage for future sessions. Or you can copy the CSS directly from the editor to your clipboard, making it easy to paste into your bear blog's theme customization area. You can export it as a .css file as well.
Admittedly, it's a silly project, but I thought some people might find it handy to preview styles throughout their site (including inner pages) without mucking about with Overrides.
Note: bear.css.observer is set to <meta name="robots" content="noindex">, and the Playground data is stored in your browser.]]></summary>

If you’re comfortable, I’d like us to try and be 10% more vulnerable than we normally would in a work setting.” I remember feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement rise in my chest. I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was. Some of my coworkers shared deeper things I’d never heard in a work setting. It was awkward. It was beautiful.
I'd rather not have my manager forcing me to do group therapy. I owe the company some work hours and they own me money.
If I want to have personal relations with someone from my work, befriend somebody, share personal things, that is my choice. My personal life is not the company business.
Of course I wouldn't say all that to the manager, but 'I'll put him on the list of people I should be careful about, and fake some confessions.]]></summary>

Joseph Edwards, a Jamaican refrigeration mechanic, spoke of radical labor politics in Rasta idioms. Let’s reason “to Rahtid!”
His selected writings have been published as Workers Self-Management in the Caribbean (2014).

This piece, authored by Joseph Edwards—also known as Fundi or the Caribbean Situationist—offers a unique perspective within the anti-authoritarian tradition of the Caribbean left.
Assumed to be the first publication of the Trinidadian labor organizing group, The New Beginning Movement (NBM) (1971–1978), this booklet was released as Abeng Pamphlet No. 1. The NBM drew inspiration from the Black Power Revolt and the legacy of C.L.R.

Over the years I have lived in several places and had a variety of dentists and one common theme that sticks with me, the nicer and higher tech the office is, the more procedures they are going to recommend you. They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow.
I've had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done.
The dentists there took xrays, etc and didn't find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong.
When I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums.
This has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill. When i got to college and went to the dentist there, they couldn't find a problem.]]></summary>

I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context.
It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter.
Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander's family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. Thi…]]></summary>

I've been thinking about this problem for a couple of years now, trying to figure out a solution. I feel like we need to wall off parts of the web. You know, have a gated community to keep the riff-raff out. Of course, that feels a bit icky, and keeps out people who might be looking for a better web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been thinking about this a lot [1]. Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?
The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple's Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.
Combining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.
Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.
I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.
