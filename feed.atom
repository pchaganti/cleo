Since Windows support graduated to stable
with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.…]]></summary>

One of our worst headaches was making these really powerful codebases work on desktop, web, mobile, and the cloud without having to completely rewrite them.  For example, to get Lightroom and Photoshop working on the web we took a winding path through JavaScript, Google’s PNaCl, asm.js, and finally WebAssembly, all while having to rethink our GPU architecture around these devices. We even had to get single-threaded builds working and rebuild the UI around Web Components. Today the web builds work great, but it was a decade-long journey to get there!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, Rohan and Saif here from Creo (https://trycreo.com/). Creo lets you make internal tools with NextJS. We’re code-first because we think engineers prefer being in their IDE (especially today, with all the advancements in dev-tools) when building out internal tooling for their company.
Here’s a demo of writing code and then deploying your tools:

And here’s one on how to get started with the CLI:

A lot of internal tool builders (eg: Retool and Tooljet) are low-code, meaning you’re given a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop UI where you can drag components onto a canvas, and then wire them up to a data source or endpoint using a form/code-block. This has the advantage of being accessible to non-programmers, who…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

To prepare for what promises to be a long and costly fight, U.S. strategists made a pre-emptive move in 2022 to turn Europe away from its trade and investment relations with Russia. In effect, they asked Germany to commit industrial suicide and become a U.S. dependency. That made Germany the first and most immediate target in America’s New Cold War. More

What is remarkable about Sir Keir Starmer, however, is that he has not a single, discernible positive quality.    If he got lost in Tesco, and his mum put out his description on the tannoy, there would be no possible chance of him being tracked down.  He is not a good speaker, his nasal voice drones on and on, a lulling invitation to the most pronounced meaninglessness.   When asked about his vision for the future, he says things like this:‘Changing the things that need changing … that is the change I will bring about!’

The October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israelis followed by the extremely disproportionate IDF assault on Gaza has been accompanied by a slew of racist invective by Israeli leaders. Dan Gillerman, the former Israeli ambassador to the UN referred to Palestinians as “horrible inhuman animals.” Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, used the same hate expression. Netanyahu called Gaza a “city of evil,” summoning the Old Testament tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, in which the Israeli government now gets to play God.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>

The TerraUSD run, however, is not the only episode of instability experienced by a stablecoin. Other noteworthy incidents include the June 2021 run on IRON and, more recently, the de-pegging of USD Coin’s secondary market price from $1.00 to $0.88 upon the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we consider the following questions: Do stablecoin investors react to broad-based shocks in the crypto asset industry? Do the investors run from the entire stablecoin industry, or do they engage in a flight to safer stablecoins? We conclude with some high-level discussion points on potential regulations of stablecoins.]]></summary>

Will the moderation continue, or will it stall? And what does it say about the current state of the labor market? In this post, we use our own measure of wage growth persistence – called Trend Wage Inflation (TWIn in short) – to look at these questions. Our main finding is that, after a rapid decline from 7 percent at its peak in late 2021 to around 5 percent in early 2023, TWin has changed little in recent months, indicating that the moderation in nominal wage growth may have stalled. We also show that our measure of trend wage inflation and labor market tightness comove very closely. Hence, the recent behavior of TWIn is consistent with a still-tight labor market.]]></summary>

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:
