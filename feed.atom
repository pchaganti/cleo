        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've developed a Hacker News reader that draws inspiration from Brutalist Web Design, the open web, Cyberpunk Aesthetics, and glitch art.
The entire project is crafted in Vanilla JavaScript, contained within a single index.html file, eschewing any external libraries. It features support for theming, including the use of third-party themes. Additionally, users have the capability to create and apply their own themes directly within the site.
Moreover, the application is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling it to be downloaded and used as an app on most devices.
I'm eager to receive feedback on both the implementation and design aspects, particularly from the Hacker News community. Mobile device testing remains a priority for further refinement, so insights in this area would be particularly valuable.
For more detailed information and to explore further:
- Project details are available at https://github.com/wkyleg/brutalist-hacker-news

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I spent years working and building 0-1 insurance products. Let me peel back some stuff that’s been happening behind the scenes.
Some officials are elected and some are appointed which all depends on the state. Appointed officials are usually more reasonable and elected are not because higher rates = mad voters = re-election chances lower.
For a long time, insurers have struggled to get sufficient rate changes approved. A literal quote for you during Covid was, “Son, I’m looking out my window at downtown {city} and I don’t see many cars on the road. We won’t approve the rate increases.”
This was with actual data of losses increasing due to supply chain disruption of auto parts, labor increases and many more things.
We basically had to write policies and hope for the best despite knowing the data / trend lines forecasting major losses.
Fast-forward and what do you have - major losses by all of these companies - and so these companies have two choices: 
- Try to get rate approvals 
- Exit the market or line of insurance
For California, the latter is the better option because at least for auto you cannot use credit, telematics or other very predictive attributes to price the risk. This results in essentially pooled risk which in aggregate drives up rates for all. Simply put, California officials did this to themselves.
For other states, the first option works but the rate increases are now significantly higher because it was near impossible to get any adequate rate increases last few years.
So, the bill has come due and it sucks for everyone as it’s either a) higher prices or b) can’t get insurance (Florida folks for certain types) or c) limited suppliers not being able to get reinsurance to share the risk results in higher rates that customers can’t afford so they go without.]]></summary>

Users would have to go to the app, choose from 10 or so canned messages like "Feeling productive", "Ready to conquer the day", and other such HR speak the CEO (or rather the HR committee he put on the important business of picking the list) felt was motivational.  This would update a page that scrolled their photos and chosen message, and showed the "EnGUAGEment" as a percent of total employees responding on a car dashboard style guage.  It hovered around 30-40% every day.  On the CEO's birthday they'd drive that baby up to 70 to 80%]]></summary>

Anyway, the only task they ever gave me was to build Cisco router ACLs to match existing traffic in the stores; they needed to implement access control but wanted to make sure they weren't blocking anything important. Because many of the stores had been opened years before, there wasn't necessarily a consistent IT stack in the store; there were a lot of one-off solutions so they wanted a universal set of rules with per-store exception lists.
So, every week, someone would drop a few terabytes of network logs in an FTP server, separated by store, and I would dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a very large software and hardware company's local office in NZ in 2001
What they asked for: Refreshing their suit of unit tests, 10,000 of them, that had gone stale (that applied to their widely used C++ telephony library)
Budget NZ$1,000,000
(Don't ask what, why, really?)
I joined half way through
Half the budget spent, nothing to show, mission mysteriously changed to producing a deep packet inspection tool. (What happened to the unit tests you ask? Be quiet! Take the money)
My job was to reach deep into their system and bring the data to the surface, roughly speaking
Thing is nobody that worked on the library wanted, needed, or asked for any aspect of what were doing
The design for it was written on a whiteboard by the project lead before I joined
Then the whiteboard was cleaned.
So the design was in one man's head
That man, the project lead, quit 3 weeks before delivery
On handover day  I was a bit afraid, I had taken care to keep good records of my obeying (increasingly unhinged) instructions,  so I was confident I could not be blamed (I was younger and naive-not part of the story)
But I fully expected an unpleasant "you did what with our money? What were you thinking?" type of unpleasant meeting
Instead the corporate types sat around a table gushing how wonderful everything was, what a brilliant job we'd all done...
I was stunned.  I understand now, I learnt that day, that it was in no-one's interest to acknowledge the waste of a million bucks
Coming from academia, as I was more or less, this was a valuable lesson.
But utterly worthless software for a million dollars
I still use some of the furniture I bought with the money....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once worked on an in-house ERP system which had been developed over about 15 years by various developers. It was the engine of the entire company, everything passed through it. The CFO and some senior leadership erroneously blamed it for their shortcomings/used it as a scapegoat. When new management took charge, an initiative was started to replace the system with an industry standard solution. Both myself and the CTO (my boss) made it clear that we strongly felt this would not only go way over budget, but ultimately fail as a project.
Having no understanding as to the technicalities involved, the project was given the go ahead by the directors after several meetings with a vendor. After the CTO and I expressed our concerns about the scale of the project and the sheer amount of functionality involved, the vendor gleefully assured us that they were experienced with "migrations of this scale" and were more than prepared, which was music to the ears of the CFO.
Daily 2-3 hour meetings followed (for many months) to define the scope of the project. Within each meeting I sort of zoned out because it became very obvious that no only did the vendor not understand the scale of the work involved, but had started cutting corners everywhere/leaving out crucial functionality, and this was just the scoping stage, no development had even started yet.
I eventually departed the company but kept in contact with the CTO and learned that after 5 years (project was scoped for 2), the migration was abandoned costing multiple millions of dollars with nothing to show for it.]]></summary>

As a bit of a gag, I’ve made a graphical IRC Client that runs entirely in the UEFI preboot environment. It features completely overdone features such as TrueType fonts, a cursor, and GUI decorations.
I first started this project as I was getting a bit tired building a from-scratch GPS receiver, and wanted to make something relatively quick and lighthearted. As tends to happen, this took a fair bit longer than I anticipated at the outset!
A fair chunk of that time was spent on the visualisations in the post showing how scroll views are modelled and how they’re rendered to a static viewport. I really hope you enjoy them!
When I first began wanting to "stuff something in UEFI that really shouldn’t be in UEFI", my first instinct was a Twitter client. As it turns out, someone has already done a great job making this by using UEFI’s HTTP protocol! I therefore decided that whatever I made shouldn’t use HTTP at all, because that’s taken. I went with IRC since it sits on top of TCP and has the same social media feel that doesn’t belong anywhere near a preboot environment.]]></summary>

At Ænix, we have a deep affection for Kubernetes and dream that all modern technologies will soon
start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.

CIA agents who believe the heirs to Fidel Castro focused death rays at their skulls and believe it with such conviction that they suffered vertigo, nausea and felt they were going to die and then rise from the dead to eat other government officials, will not willingly let go of their peculiar and addled pensees. To the extent that Havana Syndrome is projection, one has to wonder what our spooks have been up to – have THEY been testing sonic beams or microwaves that induce nausea in the floridly paranoid? We’ll never know. But given the outlandish CIA experiments on the human body and psyche down the years, it’s a good bet they have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> In 2010 and 2011, the FAA issued two fines against Dause and his business for failing to comply with federal aviation regulations, totaling $933,000. But FAA spokesperson Gregor told SFGATE that the fine was never collected by the agency, which eventually referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for further action. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the fine was ever paid.
Amazing how a business can just decide to not pay a fine to the FAA, and apparently it's all cool. If I missed $200 on my income taxes, the IRS would be up my ass within a year for it, but apparently the FAA doesn't urgently need that $1M.
EDIT: It keeps getting better!
> Turner’s parents filed a wrongful death suit against both Dause and the Parachute Center; three years later, a judge awarded the family a $40 million judgment, writing in the decision that Dause was personally responsible for the payment. Francine Turner told SFGATE the family has never received any payments from Dause or the Parachute Center.
So he doesn't have to pay judgments either? I need to learn this guy's amazing financial life-hack!]]></summary>

They want you to read this as "we spent $100k compared to Meta's spending billions", but that's not actually what this says. It says that they spent $100k and Meta has the resources to spend billions if they wanted to.
We don't know what Facebook spent on training LLaMA 2, but they say that it took them 184320 A100-80GB GPU-hours to train the 7B model [0]. AWS charges $14.46/hour for an instance that has 8 of those [1], which amounts to $1.81/GPU/hr.
At that rate and assuming they paid something resembling AWS's list price, LLaMA 2 7B cost ~$333k. That's more than $100k, but not by orders of magnitude, and it's likely that Facebook wasn't paying the full price AWS is charging today.

-The UX of most of the basic car functions was much harder to learn than a typical rental car. I'm sure that Tesla's UX quirks start to feel normal after a while, but I had trouble locating basic car functions and had to text with Tesla-owning friends for advice.

The issue was twofold:
1. Repair cost and parts availability. Fleet damage was more expensive to repair and took longer. That means more of the fleet is offline at any given time and cost to operate is a bit higher.
2. Tesla lowered prices forcing them to recognize the depreciation. The cars resale value dropped faster than they anticipated.
Car and RV rental companies have this problem. People don't want to rent ragged out vehicles. In the case of RVs units for rental are built extra cheap so they don't last anyway. The model is get more in rent then you lose in depreciation then dump the vehicle. In the case of RVs they often turnover the entire fleet yearly.
The real killer was no doubt depreciation. That breaks the whole rental car model.]]></summary>

As another commenter noted, this article doesn’t pull out clearly how this whole credit card reward scheme actually works. The Acquired episode does, by the end.
It works like this: the ‘luxury’ credit card providers, partnering with Visa, take money away from merchants in order to extract profit for themselves while keeping the credit card consumers happy. The merchants are pissed about this, and regularly make lawsuits to regulate interchange. The money extracted by the credit card companies and Visa causes merchants to raise prices for everyone regardless of whether they have a rewards card or use a credit card at all.
This creates in effect a massive money transfer from the poor, who do not use rewards cards, to the rich consumers who do. The Acquired podcast provides specific numbers on just how much worse off poor consumers are given this system, and how much the richest consumers benefit.
I come from Australia where interchange fee regulation tamps down on the kind of credit card mania and fetishism seen in the USA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> But how far does this go in explaining why merchants "choose" to participate in this program. The obvious answer would seem to be that they get no benefit from the system as it exists but have no real choice, but maybe there is a better answer?
The simple reason why issuers don’t make every card a signature rewards card is that merchants would revolt.
The interchange fee schedule[1] is fascinating. Dozens of categories of merchants with different rates. There is no technical reason for this. Fraud costs are borne by merchants and to some extent processors, but not the issuer banks that receive the interchange fee.
The fee schedule reflects a kind of battle for customers. It’s worth repeating that most of interchange for these higher end cards is passed back to the customer in the form of rewards. Essentially, merchants are willing to pay higher fees to support the cards that higher spending customers prefer.
But there is a limit. We can observe that not all merchants accept AmEx, which has some of the highest interchange rates. If every visa/MC card were a signature card, more merchants would push back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An interesting article, but it doesn't sufficiently emphasize  the lede:  When you use a reward card, the merchant is charged a higher fee than if you used a "normal" card.  Simply by putting a different branding on the plastic you pay with, the credit card issuer gets more money from each transaction.
The article goes on to ask the question "Why isn’t every card a rewards card?", meaning why doesn't every card pay cash back, but I think the more interesting question is why every card isn't branded in a way that makes the issuer more money.  Why do they bother to issue cards where they get paid less?  Why not brand every card as a "Signature Preferred" and then pocket the money instead of giving it to the less discerning customers?
And the most interesting question only gets a handwave: "The basic intuition underlying rewards cards as a product is that highly desirable customers have options in how they spend their money."  But how far does this go in explaining why merchants "choose" to participate in this program.  The obvious answer would seem to be that they get no benefit from the system as it exists but have no real choice, but maybe there is a better answer?
I liked the topic, but wished the author could have given more insight on what's happening behind the scenes to produce the outcome we see.]]></summary>

We have to pursue policies that are in the U.S. national interest, but we should not be looking to gratuitously put it in China’s face.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>
