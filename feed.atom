        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year's Thanksgiving has a special flavor. My son, who lives far away in Austin, Texas, is here for a visit. I still live in the house where he grew up, and he enjoys these nostalgic returns. After we got home from the airport yesterday, he went for a run. He came home to report that he'd passed the homes of old friends, the middle school he attended, and various spots where he's committed various teenage sins in his wayward youth.
A little later, we went to the train station to pick up his daughter, our granddaughter, who was traveling to meet us from Virginia, where she attends school. We all went out for a sushi feast before coming home to hang out, telling stories, and making each other laugh.
I get up early, and as I sit here writing, I have that wonderful protective parental feel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The colonial origins of Thanksgiving (or what many natives often refer to as Thankskilling or Thankstaking) is not something to celebrate. While we cannot pinpoint the original “Thanksgiving” celebration, President Abraham Lincoln made it a national holiday in 1863. The now ubiquitous “Pilgrims and Indians” weren’t included in the tradition until 1890. The national mythos surrounding this holiday does not take into consideration the long and violent history of contact between European settlers (in this case English pilgrims – puritans) and the Indigenous populations that already inhabited the land (the Wampanoag people.) It is in these forgotten histories that we see the history of this holiday for what it truly is: English pilgrims, unprepared to survive on the land, stranded on Turtle Island. Yet, those who did survive those early winters would ultimately engage in a brutal campaign of colonialism and genocidal activity. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between November 15 and 16, 2024, the government of Peru hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. This 21-country gathering that first started in 1989 brings together the major countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the major countries that ring the Pacific Ocean, including the United States and China. There was nothing dramatic at the APEC forum itself, whose Machu Picchu Declarationcould have been written at any of the previous forums. There is one sentence in the Declaration that was of interest: “Unprecedented and rapid changes continue to shape the world today.” However, the governments could not elaborate on that sentence given their different views on those changes. Even though the meeting itself did not articulate the “rapid changes,” events outside the meeting in Lima made the nature of these changes very clear. More

PyTorch’s Autograd feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as gradients) over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.

> All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]
> So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.

I've never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I've never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.
About a year ago the battery wasn't making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.
But then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device's release date1. So I'm stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.
And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly fun…]]></summary>

I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.
I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.
If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.]]></summary>

Thanksgiving 2022. We just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner and were relaxing, watching TV. Cocoa was lying on the couch when she suddenly started dry heaving, as if trying to throw up but with nothing to expel.
Strange.
We took her outside. She was on and off dry heaving. Nothing was coming out. Maybe she wanted to go use the bathroom. She walked very slowly, something clearly off. We brought her back inside, her little body feeling so tender.

Focusing on equality of outcomes in a society that structurally does not afford equality of opportunities is a fool’s game that ends with Bergeron-esque levels of absurdity.
Imho, the only viable/main solution is to acknowledge that we all aren’t equal, we don’t all have access to the same opportunities, but as a country we can implement policies that lessen the imbalance.
Head Start is a good example.
Well-run gifted and talented programs in schools are also good examples.

🎵 听音乐
通勤时间总是无聊的，我最早的时候是听歌。但是我这个人有一个毛病，很难听得进去新歌，但是我的收藏列表我又听烂了。所以现在通勤路上听音乐的频率较少，也会，但不多。
📻 听播客
我个人很喜欢听播客，不光在通勤的时候会听。但是我又很挑，对于信息和内容输出质量很低的播客我极少收听。所以我有一个白名单，一旦白名单的播客更新，我才会考虑听。所以，不会每天有一个小时的可收听量。
📚 听书
这个是我最近半个月养成的新习惯，起因是我在一些播客中听到过一些书籍的分享，但是我又没有很好的建立起读新书的习惯，所以我就瞅准了通勤这段时间。恰好微信读书又有听书模式，如果你是付费会员，可以想听歌一样的听书。这简直是一举多得，解决了我通勤路上恰好收听内容不足的隐患，又拓展了「阅读量」，还能完成微信读书的任务。

▲ 阅读了 13 天的成果
关于微信读书我准备后面找时间专门写一篇有趣的观察和思考，作为产品分析吧。
💬 总结
综上所述，我现在通勤路上依然会听歌和听播客，听歌比较少，听播客比听音乐稍多。这两者的区别在于听歌可以随时开播，听播客我需要提前甄选一下听的内容。如果两者都不想实施，我使用了微信读书的听书来补齐，这样又可以在这个通勤的时间段内拓展出一个内容输入的渠道。可喜可贺。]]></summary>

Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be “tough on immigrants” showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as “protecting the nation against an immigrant ‘invasion’” widely prevailed. More

In support of this strategy, the Biden administration implemented a flawed plan, squandering more than $320 million of U.S. taxpayers’ money on a failed floating pier, and inefficient airdropping—an illusory remedy aimed at buying Israel more time by diverting attention from the siege, while offering a hollow promise to alleviate starvation in Gaza.

However, I think developers were already looking for reasons to stop interacting with Stack Overflow. LLMs have massive blind spots. New framework releases, yesterday's OS update, and niche languages are not in LLM training data. These are the problems where Stack Overflow should shine over AI. Yet traffic is declining even in these areas.
I recently found myself caught between these two worlds, trying to solve a problem too new for LLMs, but running into the exact community issues driving people away from Stack Overflow. My experience might shed some light on why developers are leaving, even when AI can't help them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a two-month writing hiatus, I'm back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.
Two weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I'm gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.
Transportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I've opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.
This isn't my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I'm visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I've been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic "konnichiwa"s.
My ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.
My professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I'll join a new workplace where I've already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I'm aware that I'm really lucky to have found such an environment, and I'm hopeful about building a long-term community here.]]></summary>

The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine.

Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today's newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I've always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.
Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.
If you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents. They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.

There’s a lot of not so great things happening in the world right now that we often forget to be thankful for the little things.
Or is that just me?
I used to write one line a day of things that I was grateful for. In every day life, I would find something that I am thankful for. It could be as little as the sun came out today after days of rain to big things like I got the promotion I’ve been waiting for today.
Then I stopped.
It was hard to keep up with. I was struggling to find the silver lining in things. I got tired of people telling me it happened for a reason. You’ll see!
With Thanksgiving in the horizon, I want to bring a little bit of that grateful attitude back. I know, I know,…]]></summary>

Notes: This essay is a response to Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot, or the necessity to write our own histories which was posted to BC Counter Info on Nov 9th, 2024.

 ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot’ has the posture of a disappointed lover who didn’t make it into their songwriter ex’s latest LP. None of the songs are about them, so they leave a scathing review. 
 The anonymous author argues that Yintah should have included the history of anarchist participation in the Wet’suwet’en struggle. I agree that the film is incomplete witho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.]]></summary>

Why
前一段时间发现自己在浑噩过日子，并不是像一具行尸走肉，而是缺少自律的可持续的沉淀过程。熟悉我的朋友可能知道，我运营了一个名叫不求甚解的 Telegram 频道，这是我的得意之作，也是我的心头之痛。为什么这么讲，得意的是因为我在运营这个介质的同时获得了诸多关注和肯定，难过的是我经常缺少更新它的动力。
但是我经常思考。是的，作为一个 INTJ-A，我是非常喜欢思考，人生经历了 30 多年，到达了现在的阶段，我已经养成了时刻思考的能力和习惯，但是我缺少系统化沉淀的动作。
所以，我准备开启我人生的新阶段 ———— 养成自律的思考到沉淀的链路。
How
我准备按照时间周期的维度产出一些内容：
[Daily] 每天在这里写日记，哪怕是流水账；
[Weekly] Telegram 频道一周至少 3 更；
[Monthly] 召集思想同频的小伙伴录制播客。
Specially
需要说明几点，以上产出的内容，都是为了我自己，如果能帮助到此刻正在看的你，我很荣幸，但这不是我的职责以及初心。
最后，除了上面那些看起来很高大上的原因外，另外一个让我开始想要系统化记录自己生活的原因，是因为我看到了我的朋友 61 正在这么做，能够通过他的内容中感受到他对生活的热爱以及快乐，我也同样需要这些。
以上，祝各位都好。]]></summary>

- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.
- One was in an industry that didn't need "Webscale" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.
Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.
The place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.
I don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.]]></summary>

The title, of course, refers to the "Buy Me a Coffee" buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it's often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn't feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it's a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian "jantelagen" (Law of Jante). I don't know.
I don't blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it's nice to know that I don't "have to." And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you're ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I'll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️]]></summary>

She'd meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn't have the heart to tell her there wouldn't be a next round. I said I didn't know, and that I'd have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she'd asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it's when we meet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been thinking back to that wonderful week I had in the summer when I had no social media on my phone. How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it'll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).
The issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn't an issue for me last time, this time I'm still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don't want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can't help but go to my phone whenever I'm bored, no matter how much I try to help it.
I've been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I've taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.]]></summary>
