        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people think AMD should support these translation layers but I think it's a bad idea. CUDA is not designed to be vendor agnostic and Nvidia can make things arbitrarily difficult both technically and legally. For example I think it would be against the license agreement of cuDNN or cuBLAS to run them on this. So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.
Chasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool's errand. The important users of CUDA are open source. AMD can implement support directly in the upstream projects like pytorch or llama.cpp. And once support is there it can be maintained by the community.]]></summary>

(but i knew that that would be particularly difficult to do on such a tight schedule).
honestly, before my trip, i was 100% convinced i’d hate being on the ocean for such long stretches of time. and this is still partially true now that it's over. i’m prone to motion sickness and i’m afraid of a slow death. i ended up partially bedridden for three days, so i was right to worry about the former. i couldn’t eat anything but apples, and i threw up everytime i moved from my bed. it sucked, but at least i'm not dead.
when i recovered, i discovered that it was ironically grounding to stroll the topmost deck and see nothing but blue and horizon. and that it was especially beautiful at night, even if you couldn't really see the stars at all. instead, i’d watch the water long enough for it to look like a fingerprint. then, even longer to find the unicorns in the sea foam. i found myself returning to the same thought each time: in the grand scheme of all things, i am fortunately very small. i will never run out of earth to explore. nothing is never really just nothing, but nothing feels as good as finally being home too.]]></summary>

We appreciate that the authors of Mise en Common want to elaborate similarities and clarify differences, and move past bad faith. We’re taking this as an occasion to respond and to clarify ideas that we’ve been reflecting on for a few years now.

Abstract:
 The article presents a first overview of the emergence and early development of anarchism in the Republic of Cyprus, utilising archival material. It contextualises Cypriot anarchism within the broader wave of political ideas making their appearance after the island’s de-facto partition in 1974, tracing the formation of the first anarchist groups and the circulation of early Cypriot anarchist publications. It moves on to briefly discuss three key historical moments of anarchist political expression, followed by an examination of early Cypri…]]></summary>

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursive signifiers, through which the mediation of a fixed meaning is structured and social reality is experienced.

 According to your court indictment, Conspiracy of Cells of Fire is a terrorist organization. But words were never, nor are or will ever be neutral. Words acquire the meaning given by the person who uses them. We do not speak the language of the judges and prosecutors. We speak the language of the hunted who have refused the victimʼs role, the wanted who have not handed themselves in to the authorities, the prisoners who have not caged their will for freedom, the anarchists who have never kneeled in front of Power.

On the 27th of April, Christos Tsakalos, for the case of C.C.F. with the upgraded charge of the managerial executive, was transported to the prisons of Koridallos, after a call for appearance at the juridical council, where he denies to appear.
 Today therefore, Wednesday the 27th of April, I announce officially to the juridical authorities, to not “bother me again” with their repeated calls for my presence in the interrogative process, because they will receive my total refusal and my factual contempt. 
 There is not even a millimeter of dialogue to be shared with my judges.

 148 years ago this week, on April 6, 1871, armed participants in the revolutionary Paris Commune seized the guillotine that was stored near the prison in Paris. They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians. At the time, the Commune controlled Paris, which was st…]]></summary>

 The purpose of this piece is to better understanding of mass media’s relationship to rebels (including anarchists of all stripes), in general as well as in the context of a repressive atmosphere in Bristol. As well as raising local specifics, it hopes to encourage stronger awareness around wider issues of representation and counter-insurgency. 
 It will speak critically, even harshly when deemed necessary, of some self-professed radicals’ interactions with the establishment – but not out of an impulse for character-assassination. Contrary t…]]></summary>

However, in the few public ones I am in, I often see groups of people whose choices of words and how to express themselves, how to enter conversations, their tone and views make them feel eerily... unreal.

THE TWILIGHT ZONE — Picture if you will the citizens of a small town in Northeast Ohio, facing a daunting toxic threat yet trapped in a maze of regulatory capture at the so-called Environmental Protection Agency. Not the citizens of East Palestine, though they too face a challenging quest for the truth about the environmental health threats they may face. But the citizens in and around Uniontown, Ohio have been trapped in such a quagmire for decades, subjected to a dystopian level of gaslighting from the powers that be in an effort to bury the truth regarding the ultra-hazardous poisons reportedly dumped at the town landfill.
The Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL) in Uniontown closed in 1980 and was designated as an EPA Superfund site in 1984, listed as one of the most contaminated sites in the country. Akron area rubber companies were the biggest known polluters at the IEL, dumping millions of gallons of industrial waste and chemicals in the ‘60s and ‘70s. But local citizen eyewitnesses have long testified that the U.S. military was another covert client in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s. This includes the IEL’s former owner Charles Kittinger, who came forward in 2001 to speak of clandestine dumping of three metal eggs of nuclear weapons waste he was eerily warned not to speak of.

We are endlessly and repetitively treated to sermons on the wonders of capitalism. Everybody will be taken care of, with the proviso that you are willing to work. As I have had frequent cause to note, that a line has to be furiously propagated across every channel speaks to a lack of concrete reality. And as more people, especially young people, see that they have declining possibilities, more questioning inevitably arises.
The only thing worse in capitalism to having a job, however unpleasant, is not having a job. Unemployment benefits are barely at starvation rates and end all too soon. Naturally, that is worse in the United States than most other advanced capitalist countries of the Global North. Six months is the limit set at a rate well less than half of what your wages were in the job you just lost. And given that six months is the average time necessary to secure new employment, that means around half of those collecting unemployment insurance will likely have a spell of no income at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took me a while to get settled into this particular space of mine on the Interwebs. I didn't know what I wanted out of it, but over time (past few months) it just kind of grew into its own thing.
Notes by JCProbably started out as just a place for scrappy thoughts, and scattered notes. Nothing too serious. It was hosted on a different platform, while what I called my "primary" blog (titled: With Love, JCProbably) was hosted in another1. That one included my microposts that I labeled as musings.
When starting this Notes subdomain, I initially said2
I'm hoping to use this page as a more scattered note, a digital post-it of some sort, when I think of things... and possibly just start linking more coherent thoughts when I write my Week Notes to it.
After the May challenge, I started writing more in this space. By June, I transferred it to Bear (where you're reading this now), and I'm in a much more comfortable space when it comes to writing and blogging.
Anyways, all of this to say that I am also looking into (re)adding my short-form thoughts and musings here (to consolidate everything). I've come to accept that I don't need to always have a long-winded post about a specific topic on here.
Sometimes I really just want to write a few sentences about how I'm feeling, or ponder on some thoughts, and calling it a day.
These posts will be tagged #musings — in case you were curious (but probably not). And no, those will (hopefully) not be as long as this ended up to be. I'm also hoping to include just every day photos that are a little bit more casual3 than what I post on my site specifically for photos.
Okay, that's it. Seriously.

It still is, but I haven't been wanting to go on there lately, so I'm not even going to link it on here.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[spotify is legal piracy. you can listen to most of your music by just paying a small amount and most of that doesn't go to the artist. hell with the rise of AI, enshittification got to a level that it never has before. I just don't want to be a part of that anymore.
there is also another reason I'm doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.

how I manage it
I download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn't get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.
I use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.
notes
you can also take a look at kit's post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was watching a Swedish music documentary. In one of the scenes, the artist Errol (aka Eddie Meduza) says:
If you think too much, you go crazy. Take life as it comes.
True words — and all too easy to forget. We put so much emphasis on thinking in our modern society that the gut feeling, the inner vibe, has been overshadowed. We think like crazy, even in moments when thinking brings nothing but confusion and fatigue.
Thinking has an important role, of course. We can make great use of this ability to plan, prepare, and make calculated decisions. But often the best thing we can do is "take life as it comes."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm no longer under this specific NDA, so, I can talk a bit about this.
It was well known in the wireless industry that ATT collected and kept the most data on all of the carriers:  7 years for text metadata, "7 years" for call history (I put that in quotations because it was rumored that ATT kept them indefinitely, but, there were technical limitations for restoring data that far back), and 7 years for the contents of the text messages themselves.  Verizon was up there as well, but, I don't remember specifics.
The carrier that I worked with kept only 3 days content of the actual messages, 28 days for the text message metadata, and 28 days for the call records for their enforcement database, but, they could get calling records and sms envelope information for billing back 7 years, and at the time, we had to implement sharding at the database layer that maintained the warrant database due to the amount of traffic that we were receiving from the calling systems and the amount of queries/data that we were sending out, in near realtime, to law enforcement users who paid $10,000/month for access to that data.
AT&T wasn't storing this data out of the kindness of their heart, it was a (probably small) revenue stream for them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn't miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.
Perhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn't a failure, it's essential, especially for problems in systems you've never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn't signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until the US federal government pays civilian tech talent competitively, this is always going to be an issue.
Your typical hands-on-keyboard blue team engineer in federal government is a GS-12 getting paid around $68,000 per year (or $99k in very high cost of living areas like DC). They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.
The best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.
As a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.
If there's one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They've done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.]]></summary>

 Left and far-left forces dominated the Ukrainian political space. After the February Revolution of 1917, N. Makhno expanded his activities in the south of Ukraine, which turned into a powerful peasant movement. At first, N. Makhno and his movement did not have their own political program. He was strongly influenced by anarchist ideas, but during the revolution an independent ideological search developed in N. Makhno …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some people around us who live on a totally different frequency, especially in the work environment.
They never shut up.
They always seek a chance to talk to you.
They don't let you have a peaceful and silent moment.
They talk but don't say anything.
They do not understand that we just need peaceful and silent moment.
They do not understand that we don't like them.
They expect attention and response.
It is hell when I see them around. I just cannot escape. I usually try to put my headphones on and listen to music at full volume. But this time, they wave their hand at me to talk to me - and in that moment I want to scream.
It does not matter if you give them very short answers and ignore. They never stop.

Because of this, I developed a habit of looking at the floor so that I won't have eye contact with them. Sometimes I close my eyes and pretend to be sleeping. It's so difficult to be kind sometimes. 

My social battery is already pretty weak and people who live on a different frequency are just torturing my soul. People like me should work at a cave or something like that. I lose my sanity when I want peaceful moment while having no escape.]]></summary>

Swedish unions are governed from the top down and are therefore bad at serving workers' interests. So writes Rasmus Hästbacka of the syndicalist union SAC. Based on his new book, he suggests how worker-led unions can be rebuilt.
 It’s a truism that capitalism is not a democracy; capitalism means economic dictatorship, which is most evident in our workplaces.…]]></summary>

They're doing some kind of maintenance.
The air is hot and thick, and I'm pining for some AC.
Took the doggo out for our morning walk and stopped at Timmies to get a coffee and breakfast sandwich, then remembered I had to walk up four flights of stairs bc—no power.
K drove me back to the city last night, and as much as I miss being in the country...coming home to my own apartment and bed felt nice.
As I was falling asleep, I saw the tiniest of ants crawling up my arm, and immediately murder, death, kill for that little guy and of course I then googled what would happen if an ant crawled into your ear and nothing good came out of that.
I distracted myself by watching some ASMR and fell asleep in my perfectly temperature-controlled bedroom (K's apartment is a veritable icebox).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was diagnosed with lupus a few years ago. My mom also had it and passed away after 10 years due to complications. My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job.
I did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn’t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation.
Previously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free.
I also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn’t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I’ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation.
I hope this helps, though it’s just my personal experience.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.]]></summary>

 Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin outlined five goals for his war: Ukraine’s non-alignment with NATO; a change in Ukraine’s government; a severe limitation of Ukraine’s defence capacity; the seizure of Ukrainian territory (with international recognition); and the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia. 
 In the first weeks of the war, Putin also had a maximalist agenda: the quick occupatio…]]></summary>

So first and foremost, could you give us and the readers an update? Last many of us heard, one of you was released.
 So for those who don’t already know about our case and a small update: 
 On November 3, 2022 we four comrades were arrested, accused of the arson attack to the meat company Susaron, a national industry that has been supplying the whole country with beef, pork and poultry meat for years. 
 On November 4, we were remanded in custody for the duration of the investigation. Accused of burning six trucks, t…]]></summary>

If your trading is not dropped into one of these buckets, you are probably going to struggle. Month after month, the money is made within these buckets. If you spend most of your time outside of these buckets, you probably aren't making much progress, getting lucky, or you have some structural edge such as a large following, a broker that provides you with the midpoint or better on the majority of your fills, or some dumbass CFD "broker" that allows you to hit the bid on stocks on SSR with unlimited size without impacting the market...
This is where the money is being made, this is where the focus ought to be. If you think you can reinvent the wheel or feel the need to do so, you are wasting your time.

Title: Preliminary Conception of Zen Social Ethics (Continued)
Subtitle: Problem of "Anjin" (安 心, Peace of Mind)

Source: Retrieved on 07/10/2024 from https://noselvesnomasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hakugen_ethics_2.pdf

 By "Anjin" is meant here spiritual calmness created by Prajna. Prajna is a unique intuition that sees the true nature of things as they are (Yathabhutam). "Zazen-shin" (坐 禅 箴, Instruction in Zazen) by Dogen (1200 -1253) reads: "A bird flies as a bird does; a fish swims likes a fish!" The essence of things seen by Prajna or Yathatathyadarsana (如 実 見, seeing into the truth as it is) is named "Suchness" (tathata) or "Emptiness" (sunyata), because it is beyond our daily expression which is the result of discriminative consciousness …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Man, I'm conflicted. I mean, Zed works pretty damn well. So far my biggest annoyance with Zed though is that it's constantly trying to download language servers and other tools and run them. And sure, that's handy, but 1. I don't really want it, I'd much rather only use distribution-provided tools. 2. It doesn't work at all on NixOS, so it's just wasting its time and our bandwidth constantly downloading and trying to update binaries that will never run.
The thing is, I would just disable it, but you can't, as far as I can tell. There's this somewhat angry issue about it here:
https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12589
They might have a point but beyond whether or not they have a point regarding the fact that it automatically fetches binaries from the Internet, not having an option to disable it is just cruel.
I still like Zed a lot and I also have a big appreciation for the design of GPUI, which I think is a very well-designed UI library that puts focus on the important things. So, I hope it goes well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a suggestion. One of the best features of pure text editors (and incredible, not all of them implement it) is autosave keeping the "unsaved" state of the file.
For example, if you make some changes in a file (new or not), don't save the changes, close and open the editor, the state of the opened files are kept like I never had closed the editor. The unsaved files are still unsaved. New edited files are still there, unsaved, ready to user manually save them.
Notepad++ works that way, and it is an amazing feature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried zed for a few weeks because I'm generally sympathetic to the "use a native app" idea vs Electron. I generally liked it and its UX but:
1. VSCode is pretty damn fast to be honest. Very rarely is my slowdown in my work VSCode loading. Maybe I don't open very large files? Probably 5k lines of typescript at most.
2. Integration with the Typescript language server was just not as good as VSCode. I can't pin down exactly what was wrong but the autocompletions in particular felt much worse. I've never worked on a language server or editor so I don't know what's on zed/VSCode and what's on the TS language server.
Eventually all the little inconveniences wore on me and I switched back to VSCode.
I will probably try it again after a few more releases to see if it feels better.]]></summary>

is a crazy thing to write in an abstract. Did they try to probe that hypothesis at all? I could (well actually I can't) share some examples from my job of GPT-4v doing some pretty difficult fine-grained visual tasks that invalidate this.
Personally, I rate this paper [1], which makes the argument that these huge GenAI models are pretty good at things - assuming that it has seen a LOT of that type of data during training (which is true of a great many things). If you make up tasks like this, then yes can be REALLY bad at them, and initial impressions of AGI get harder to justify. But in practice, we aren't just making up tasks to trip up these models. They can be very performant on some tasks and the authors have not presented any real evidence about these two modes.

Additionally I’m sure they use pre-release hardware and software and give feedback about how to improve it.
I don’t know what AMD has in mind for this acquisition but I could see there being a lot of value having an in house LLM team to create models for customers to build on, run in benchmarks, and improve their products.]]></summary>

On HN, we want comments that are thoughtful—i.e. that come from reflection, not reflex [1]; and specific—i.e. that have to do with what's different about a story, not what's generic. This is not particular to any topic; it's an optimization problem: we're trying to optimize the site for intellectual curiosity [2].
The trouble with reflexive comments is that they repeat responses that have already happened many times—rather as if they're being served from cache [3]. The trouble with generic comments is that the generic level is too abstract to say anything new or interesting. Put those together and you get repetition, the arch-enemy of curiosity [4].

 A couple weeks ago, I was talking to my friends who run the podcast It Could Happen Here. “Summer is coming, and an awful lot of people are newly radicalized. You all should put out an episode about what the next steps are,” I told them. 
 “Perfect,” someone replied. “Write it and record it by May 20th.” 
 So I wrote a short and incomplete guide for new activists. You can hear me present it in audio format if you’d like.

 A short poem “Adoring Naivety” by a Christian poet Jukichi Yagi (1827–1927) runs as follows: 
 Rice bread, 
 Whole-rice bread, 
 Fresh and steaming! 
 Whole-rice bread! 
 A bread seller goes about a “Non-acting” (Mu-i 無 爲 akarma) path singing cries of wares, as if in ecstacy over his singing.[1]
 This verse seems to suggest the aesthetic character of the Japanese folks. In the early days, Japanese peddlers, such as gold-fish vendors, beancurd dealers and seedling-peddlers used to peddle by crying in rythmical voices. Mood, relish, flavour and atmosphere carry great weight in a Japanese life. “Japanese ph…]]></summary>

Instead of a Prologue
 About the subject of “Individuality and the anarchist group”, one could say that it’s a timeless issue within the anarchist milieu… Is an anarchist individuality subjugated or liberated within a group? How does the individual encounter the collective? Can disagreements between comrades of the same collective be creative or do they inevitably lead to disputes, rivalries, intrigues, competitions and end up in rupture? 
 How are friendships and cliques able to bring about a cancellation of an anarchist group? 
 What is the relationship of an anarchist organization to the expulsions…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One less-secretive way I've seen pregaps used is for live recordings.
The crowd noise betwixt songs can be contained in a pregap, so that it is only ever heard when listening to the album straight-through (instead of in shuffle or track-program mode).
---
Another fun feature of audio CDs is indexes.
A disc can have 99 tracks, and each track can have some pregap (including track 1, as the article discusses).  And each of these 99 tracks can be further subdivided with 99 index markers.
This gives a CD the theoretical ability to have 9,801 selectable audio segments.
Although realistically, I've only owned a couple of CD players that even displayed index numbers and exactly one CD player (a Carver TL-3300) that allowed a person to seek to a given index number within a track.
(And I've only known one CD to actually make use of indexes in any useful manner, which was a sound effects CD from the early 1980s that had a lot more than 99 sounds on it -- all organized by tracks, and sub-organized by index marks.  I just can't think of the name right now.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Indeed, last year GitHub was said to have tuned its programming assistant to generate slight variations of ingested training code to prevent its output from being accused of being an exact copy of licensed software.
If I, a human, were to:
1. Carefully read and memorize some copyrighted code.
2. Produce new code that is textually identical to that. But in the process of typing it up, I randomly mechanically tweak a few identifiers or something to produce code that has the exact same semantics but isn't character-wise identical.
3. Claim that as new original code without the original copyright.
I assume that I would get my ass kicked legally speaking. That reads to me exactly like deliberate copyright infringement with willful obfuscation of my infringement.
How is it any different when a machine does the same thing?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A non-stressful day at work is hard to come by. I am constantly straddling the fine line between being burnt out, and just flipping a table and walking away. At the end of the day, those two feelings are basically the same side of a coin.
I work remotely full-time, for the most part. Sometimes I travel for workshops, but that’s mostly just at the beginning of kicking off a new product that I’ve been asked to build. Any other time, I’m mostly working in my home office, which has become my favorite place in the house, yet the place where I stress out the most.
I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I’m in meetings probably 5-6 hours a day. With a majority of my current team in Central and Eastern time zones (2-3 hours ahead of me), sometimes I also forget to take a break and eat. It’s easy to lose track of time when I’m focused on solving this problem or that.
I also forget to breathe.
The weather finally cooled down yesterday, and a little bit today before we hit another heat wave. LSC constantly encourages me, and at times pushes me to go for a walk. Take a walk around the block, and just breathe. We practice breathing together, inhaling and exhaling. Inhale the fresh air slowly, keep it in for a few seconds, exhale slowly. Then we go back in the house, and I feel a tiny bit better.
Sometimes we get into what we’re doing so deeply that we forget the essentials. We forget to breathe. We don’t notice it until we’re drowning, and it’s even harder to get back to the surface. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder to stop what you’re doing, take a walk if you can, and breathe.
So hey, let this be a reminder.
Go for a walk. Inhale that fresh air. Hold it in. Exhale.

i’ve finally started a new job after my month-long vacation in europe. i’m still working in design, which is still not really my ideal (even if my high-school self was convinced it was)1. either way, it’s fun and i like it better than my previous one.
my last job was 100% remote. (they were changing this policy just as i was leaving though). i enjoyed having so much free time, of course. the commute in the philippines eats away up to 4 hours of your day, if you’re lucky. that’s not including time you spend getting ready, or time spent s…]]></summary>
