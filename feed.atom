        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long-run trends in increased access to credit are thought to improve real activity. However, “rapid” credit expansions do not always end well and have been shown in the academic literature to predict adverse real outcomes such as lower GDP growth and an increased likelihood of crises. Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.]]></summary>

Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that's bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create

Title: The Hooligans, the Stingies, the Starved People and the Bad Asses
Date: 1985
Notes: This is a translation of a leaflet written in 1985 by anarchists frequenting the Chrysallida social space in Limassol, Cyprus.
Source: https://movementsarchive.org/doku.php?id=en:leaflets:xrisalllida:kakakakathkia

 The football league is over; the mass rallies of July have also passed. The Cuéllar initiative froze, as usual, and everything indicated that Cypriot society would remain for about a month without mass spectacles to organize its boredom. 
 And suddenly “chaos” erupts in Germasogeia. A new “fruit” for the “Cypriot reality”; and the hysteria of the occasion is analogous. The newspapers are shouting about hooligans, they are searching for the “brains” (in this place it see…]]></summary>

These people usually mean well when they give such advise; they're trying to help in their own way. My parents did this all the time while I was growing up, so much so that I ended up believing it. And sometimes, it's true. It could be that "that person" is not being mean to me because they don't like me, but rather because they're having a bad day in general. I get that, and I agree that sometimes (most of the time), we make up our own problems out of confusion, miscommunication, or ignorance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came to this same conclusion some years ago while working on a side project.
Before anything LLM existed, I built a site[0] to generate fake "AWS Blog Posts."  I trained a markov chain generator on all AWS announcement posts up to that point, copied the html + css of aws's standard blog posts, then glued them all together with some python + JS.  It turned out, IMO, pretty funny!  People familiar with AWS's blog posts would often get several sentences in before they realized they were looking at word-soup.
When GPT was new, I looked into using that to "upgrade" it.  I spent a weekend messing around with Minimaxir's gpt-2-simple generating blog posts based on AWS content.  What I found was, ultimately, it was way less fun.  The posts were far too realistic to be interesting.  They read like totally-real blog posts that just happened to not be true.
I realized then that the humor of those early markov generations was the ridiculousness.  The point where, a few words or sentences in, you realized it was all nonsense.  LLM's these days are too good for that - the text they generate is sometimes wrong, but rarely nonsense in a humorous way.
Markov chain content was wrong in a "kid's say the darndest things" way, while modern LLMs are wrong in a "My uncle doesn't know basic geography" way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Unlike other social platforms, Roblox’s revenue is nearly all via user spending rather than advertising. As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.
Wow. I've never though about this before, but this is an awful second-order consequence of the high app store fees set by Apple and Google. It essentially incentivizes App makers to treat users as products not customers!
(Not too surprising for Google, but certainly goes against Apple's public stance).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Though Roblox isn’t profitable, there are some significant caveats to the situation. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow—a far more important measure than accounting-defined profits—were $650MM, about 20% of revenue. Roblox has been cash-positive for at least twenty-four quarters.
This feels like an example of the phenomenon highlighted in another recent post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41263855
Namely, that as long as Roblox's cash flow is increasing year-over-year, they probably don't care about profit. (And if cash flow ever does stop increasing, they can always get back to sustainability by pumping the brakes on reinvestment spending.)]]></summary>

1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.
About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you're willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
This becomes particularly problematic when running large-sc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I “participated” in Silent Sunday partially due to my social battery being drained. I initially thought that Silent Sunday meant posting a photo that conveys silence, tranquility, and the like. Perhaps in some ways, it still can be. However, I’d be remiss not to acknowledge it’s actual origin1 as described by mocha beanie mummy.
Sometimes I find that words can clutter a photograph. Sometimes I want to look at a photograph, and make up my own mind about it, what I think about it, rather than what others might think it should be about.
The rules guidelines are simple:2
Only one photo.
The photo you post must be taken by you.
Photo must be taken the week you post it.
No other words in the post. Title can be: Silent Sunday or date, nothing else.
Of course, like everything out there, people have done their own Silent Sunday renditions. However, from what I see in the Mastodon hashtag, people are mostly keeping to its original concept.

As such, it's up to the police as to what qualifies as indefinite. If the ruling had capped it to 14 or 30 days, that would be a useful ruling.
A hard time cap is essential because one's life too has a cap. The amount of time for which one can go without earning a livelihood also has a cap. Imagine if prison sentences didn't have a time cap.
This illustrates a common problem with our laws. They're very often vaguely defined, needlessly so, in a way that keeps attorneys and judges very rich, and the police abusive, to the detriment of the individual. In a sensible world, the laws would all be rewritten for clarity and consistency, starting with the Constitution.]]></summary>

 Vouching means different things to different anarchists. For some, to vouch for a person means the vouchee is felt to be trustworthy and competent enough for an action. For others, vouching means that the voucher has concrete evidence of the trustworthiness and competence of the vouchee, and is willing to stake their reputation on that evidence. 
 To agree on whether to vouch for someone or not, we need to be clear about what we mean by vouching. We propose three components of a vouch that might be helpful in discussing that meaning: trustworthiness, competence, and the voucher's reput…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A close friend of mine recently landed a new job and is now considering quitting.
It's impossible to predict whether you'll enjoy a workplace, but it usually becomes apparent soon after starting. If you consistently feel like "this is the wrong place for me," I strongly believe you should quit as soon as possible. I've personally quit jobs within the first week.
Given that work occupies a significant portion of our lives, it's crucial that it feels right. But the very fact that work constitutes a large part of our lives can also mislead us.
Besides work, we have relationships, hobbies, financial responsibilities, and our health to maintain. And, as we all know, life isn't always a constant joyride. Relationships can strain, health can deteriorate, and unexpected financial problems can arise.
Life is often challenging. We feel down and want to feel better.
We seek solutions and try to identify what needs to change. We yearn for a quick fix, and it's easy to blame work. Considering it occupies around a third of our daily lives, it's not surprising that we hold our jobs accountable.
"Yes, of course, it's my workplace. There we have it. I gotta quit!"
But is that really the root of the problem?
It might be partially, or not at all. Regardless, it's never wise to make major decisions based on fleeting, fluctuating, and undefined emotions.
There's usually no rush. It's worth waiting a while. The most important thing is that it's the right decision, whenever and whatever we decide.
You can't eliminate ripples on water with a slap. Wait, and they will eventually subside. Against this still background, the correct answer will emerge.]]></summary>

In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the "artifacts" of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy.

As a fellow multimedia dev, man, who cares? Sometimes we forget that software ought to be useful, not hypothetical ideals of truth. Just implement the feature for those codecs that support it and which probably are in the 98% percentile of what users actually use, regardless of the damned "general case".
Or accept and announce shamelessly that you don't have either the knowledge or the development resources to tackle such a complex feature. But excuses about not being possible for absolutely every possible codec in a completely generic way is just denying that the world is just a chaotic and dirty place where things are not ideal nor perfect.

Thanks for making a donation!
I run the relay server, but the Debian maintainer agreed to bake an alternate hostname into the packaged versions (a CNAME for the same address that the upstream git code uses), so we could change it easily if the cost ever got to be a burden. It hasn't been a problem so far, it moves 10-15 TB per month, but shares a bandwidth pool with other servers I'm renting anyways, so I've only ever had to pay an overage charge once. And TBH if someone made a donation to me, I'd just send it off to Debian anyways.
Every once in a while, somebody moves half a terabyte through it, and then I think I should either move to a slower-but-flat-rate provider, or implement some better rate-limiting code, or finally implement the protocol extension where clients state up front how much data they're going to transfer, and the server can say no. But so far it's never climbed the priority ranking high enough to take action on.
Thanks for using magic wormhole!]]></summary>

This really rings true. Just think of all the nonsense you have to deal with in the name of "security." Mandatory password change intervals. Insane rules for constructing passwords. Completely undocumented password requirements that you just have to figure out by trial and error. Complicated error messages full of security jargon. "Secret Questions" that you can't remember the answers to. And on the other side of the coin, the security of these systems themselves is like a sieve.

If anyone wants a great introduction to the context and the bigger picture, there's this great article from the NYT in 2022, written by an excellent reporter who lives in Brazil. I highly recommend this article to anyone who hasn't lived in Brazil for the last 10 years:
"To Defend Democracy, Is Brazil’s Top Court Going Too Far?"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/americas/bolsonaro-...
https://archive.is/plQFT
It covers the judge at the center of the current issue: "Mr. Moraes has jailed five people without a trial for posts on social media that he said attacked Brazil’s institutions. He has also ordered social networks to remove thousands of posts and videos with little room for appeal. And this year, 10 of the court’s 11 justices sentenced a congressman to nearly nine years in prison for making what they said were threats against them in a livestream."

PayPal provided a way to pay people and vendors without giving away your credit card number.
Square made it easy to accept payment in person on a phone, without an extensive upfront underwriting experience and without expensive fixed monthly fees.
Stripe did the same as Square, but for accepting online payments.
Fraud and Risk come in many forms, and these providers, even with their UX innovations, sit on top of those same rails to reduce fraud.  Without those rails, buyers can’t trust sellers and sellers can’t trust buyers.
In my opinion, you need to find a way to solve that problem before you can eliminate the fees being captured by these providers.]]></summary>

Based on the default Bear theme, I aimed to create a clean theme with good readability. The appearance of the list of blog posts is inspired by the beautiful McLuhan theme.
I also wanted to make it easily customizable and expandable. The solution became what I've called 'Add-ons'. These are optional additions for special tweaks. Currently, there are three, with more to come:
Print styles
Highlighted tab

You can simply delete the ones you don't want to use. If you want to use the highlighted tab part, it works best if you only have Home, Blog, and any Page in your navigation. Example code:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been feeling okay for the most part this month. I've been getting work done, I'm keeping up my habits, and I'm exploring my own creativity through writing. So it feels all the more terrible when I'm suddenly hit with a wave of depression.
For me, these waves come and go at random intervals. I could be having the best day and be hit with the most intense bouts of sadness, anxiety, and hopelessness. It might not be the most healthy thing to do, but I try to distract myself from these feelings by immersing myself in my work, hobbies, or playing video games with friends. This doesn't always help, but it does keep my mind off of it, at least for a short time.
It does get overwhelming sometimes dealing with all this by myself. I don't really have anyone in my life to speak about these things, so I have elected to scream these thoughts into the void that is my blog. I rarely, if at all, feel comfortable enough to talk about my feelings with friends or family because I was raised in a culture where that was not common or tolerated.
This might all sound hopeless, but I know that this will soon pass and that these feelings are temporary. All I have to do is ride out the waves.

 Back in probably 2004, maybe 2005, I was working in Portland, Oregon as a landscaper. It was a small crew, just three of us and our boss. Our boss was, for the most part, pretty cool. He didn’t work us to the bone. He was flexible about time off. He was down to call me Magpie. He paid us under the table. Sometimes he’d cancel work to go surfing. That kind of guy. 
 In fact, after my first week of work, I told him: “hey I’m going to leave for about a month to go block roads in Southern Oregon to stop this old growth timber sale, maybe do some treesitting. When I come back, can I have my job back?” and he said yes, an…]]></summary>

Any rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.

 Fluctuations within a continuum can be generated from diverging narratives. Uncertain climes, alternative timelines. Chronoflipping, retroswitching, taleshifting. An alterverse created via timeforge. Terra incognita.
 Narratives serve the function of temporal modulators, unbound by the shackles of progress and linearity. Vectors of radivergence. Distorting, disrupting, and corrupting conventional chronologies, conduits to alternative realities proliferate with every shift in narrative azimuth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to bed not feeling great Wednesday night. I woke up Thursday morning feeling slightly worse. I decided to push through and attend stand up at 7am. Right after, I decided that I am definitely feeling sick.
However, I had an important meeting at 8:00am. I told my team I wasn't feeling well and that after that discussion (1.5hrs later), I was logging off for the day.
I spent Thursday on the couch, resting, and watching TV… and trying not to feel guilty about calling out of work.
Today (Friday) comes around. I told myself I would gauge how I felt when I woke up. Once again, today is filled with important meetings, and meetings to prepare for more important meetings on Monday.
I called out. Now, I am going to spend Friday doing similar things as yesterday. Resting, watching tv, and trying not to feel guilty about calling out of work.
My co-worker texted me yesterday when she saw that I had called out sick.
"You are worth so much more than just work."
I think it’s an important reminder to me, and to anyone else that struggles with the guilt every time they have to call out of work. I hate letting people down, but I also know that I need to start listening to my body, and not letting her down.

It's been a while since my last Day Log (even though this is only the second). In my last one, I mentioned that we recently just started naming our plants (despite having most of them for years). Anyways, allow me to introduce you to Martha the Monstera. She was just a little baby when we got her, and she has grown to be an absolute beauty.

Using my iPhone to write blog posts feels more casual and personable. It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.
Sounds wonderful!
For me, it’s the opposite. When I write on my phone, I stop and “overthink” things. I lose the flow I crave, just letting the thoughts flow onto the page. That’s why I can’t write in English either. It becomes awkwardly stilted.
I've tried a bunch of different ways to write, and I've figured out that writing in Swedish first is the way to go for me. I usually type it up on my computer, using TextEdit in full-screen, and then translate it. After that, I go through the text and edit some parts here and there.
It might sound like a lot of extra work, but I've actually grown to enjoy the process. It’s fun, interesting, and I'm learning a ton.
Whether we choose to write on a computer, phone, or in a notebook doesn’t matter. The important thing is that we find a setup that suits us. Besides, as Cole mentions, one doesn’t exclude the other.
Changing your method for a period can work wonders if writer’s block comes knocking.
Keep writing!]]></summary>

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…]]></summary>

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12. His trade was house painting and wallpaper hanging, but as we shall see, he was an able polemicist and poet; his words were a shot of adrenaline to ra…]]></summary>

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…]]></summary>

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…]]></summary>

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recurring theme in so many startups I've seen inside is how the CEO in particular is extremely aloof with regards to presence. Sometimes that translates to aloofness for staff, but what more often happens is that when the CEO _does_ come in they expect other people to be there. So long as the alignment is good they don't care, but when it's not aligned, they just assume nobody is ever around and get real pissy about people showing up on time.
Fortunately the "good" ones are able to disassociate how much of that emotion is just them being lonely vs how much of it is actual synergy-seeking or whatever. The worst cases are people who get real tyranical, on top of just like... outright not showing up to do the actual day-to-day work that they are blockers on. A proper theory of the mind can often be quite absent.
My really glib take on this phenomenom is that a not-insignificant chunk of decision making for HR stuff is "make the CEO fill the tip-top of their
Maslovian pyramind". And to a lesser extent other executives who have decided that their job is their life.
Very annoying to listen to post-facto RTO arguments when you can feel the loneliness as the driving factor. Make a fun space, and make people's work schedules be loose enough to where they can actually relax in the space, and some people will show up! Or at the very least, give the CEO a fun side project to work on or something.]]></summary>

In Kubernetes 1.31, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity) gets enabled by default.
MatchLabelKeys - Enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates
During a workload's (e.g., Deployment) rolling update, a cluster may have Pods from multiple versions at the same time.
However, the scheduler cannot distinguish between old and new versions based on the LabelSelector specified in PodAffinity or PodAntiAffinity. As a result, it will co-locate or disperse Pods regardless of their versions.
This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcome, for example:
New version Pods are co-located with old version Pods (PodAffinity), which will ev…]]></summary>

associated with Reclaim Policy.
The reclaim policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage

When the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to be honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.31 release, a beta feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.

I know it's not as popular or sexy as it used to be, but the whole point of a foundation like Apache was to avoid these situations, even more than the way the Linux Foundation is setup. Apache _explicitly_ manages projects to avoid these downsides.
- Single corporation ownership. Projects cannot get out of the Incubator unless they demonstrate a diverse and healthy community. That doesn't mean popular, it doesn't necessarily mean best-in-class, but it means that there shouldn't be just one entity backing a project.
- Membership in Apache is _personal_ not a seat for a given company. If you're a committer on an Apache project and you move jobs, you're _still_ a committer on that project
- The Foundation owns the trademarks. There have been fights about this in the past, but the whole idea is that the _community_ owns the name, so some corporation can't claim to be the sole or official owner by naming their company or product after the open source product.
The core premise of the Apache Software Foundation is community over code, that healthy, diverse communities have a better chance of standing the test of time than open source projects backed by a single individual or company. That's the thesis at least.
The is starkly different from several other foundations, notably the Linux Foundation or Eclipse Foundation which are modeled more around industry consortiums.
Both models have their place, but I believe Apache better models the core values many of us feel strongly about when it comes to free and open source software.]]></summary>

 Buddhist Anarchism is a synthesis of Anarchism from Buddhist Religion. Buddhism is a religion over 2,500 years old that teaches people to free themselves from Dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness) through practicing Sila, Samadhi and Panya (Virtue, Concentration and Wisdom) and achieving nibbana (enlightenment, freedom from dukkha).

But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it's quite expensive, "contact us" salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor.
The Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there's was a way to walk back from it. But now there's no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition.
I think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes?
I wish them the best, they're a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Volumes in Kubernetes have been described by two attributes: their storage class, and
their capacity. The storage class is an immutable property of the volume, while the
capacity can be changed dynamically with volume
resize.
This complicates vertical scaling of workloads with volumes. While cloud providers and
storage vendors often offer volumes which allow specifying IO quality of service
(Performance) parameters like IOPS or throughput and tuning them as workloads operate,
Kubernetes has no API which allows changing them.
We are pleased to announce that the VolumeAttributesClass
KEP,
alpha since Kubernetes 1.29, will be beta in 1.31. This provides a generic,
Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO.
Like all new volume features in Kubernetes, this API is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes is renowned for its robust orchestration of containerized applications,
but as clusters grow, the demands on the control plane can become a bottleneck.
A key challenge has been ensuring strongly consistent reads from the etcd datastore,
requiring resource-intensive quorum reads.
Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a major improvement:
consistent reads from cache, graduating to Beta in Kubernetes v1.31.
Why consistent reads matter
Consistent reads are essential for ensuring that Kubernetes components have an accurate view of the latest cluster state.
Guaranteeing consistent reads is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of Kubernetes operations,
enabling components to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

Comrade Creaghe is doing some more practical propaganda, by refusing to pay poor rates. He has taken the opportunity to explain his views on the subject, in the Sheffield Independent. His letter is so good and interesting that we reprint the whole of it:

Nick agrees, writing:
