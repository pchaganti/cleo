        <updated>2024-07-03T15:20:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I found out that I have been celebrating the wrong day for a quarter of a century.
Let me back up a little bit‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm pretty good at remembering dates. If a date was at some point important to me, or I make a conscious effort to remember a date, it typically sticks with me. This can be a good, bad or absolutely useless talent depending on how you look at it. I even remember the date of when my first ‚Äúserious‚Äù boyfriend asked me to be his girlfriend the summer before high school. I frequently remind my parents about my grandparents‚Äô upcoming death anniversaries because they never seem to remember. I am basically a (niche) walking calendar.
So of course, I have deemed myself in charge of reminding my family on when we first set foot on US soil. Every year on July 3rd, I remind them of the date, and they just accept it as truth.
Except this year.
This year, my dad beat me to the punch. He texts the family group chat on July 2nd (yesterday) to let me know that it‚Äôs been 26 years since we first touched down in Newark International Airport in New Jersey. Of course, I countered and said that he was a day early (because I have literally been reminding them for the past 25 years). My mom jumps in with just a ‚ÄúNo. July 2nd‚Äù before my dad shows the stamp on our passport that literally said: US IMMIGRATION: JULY 2, 1998 and said ‚ÄúProof‚Äù. I imagined him doing a mic drop after that text.
So for the past 25 (now 26 years), I‚Äôve been celebrating commemorating the wrong day, and no one bothered to correct me until now.
Oops.
Anyways, here‚Äôs to 26 years (+a day) of living here (I guess).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The author links to the somewhat dystopian blog where the email sender is quite proud of their work. Their words (or perhaps that of an LLM):
> Could an AI agent craft compelling emails that would capture people's attention and drive engagement, all while maintaining a level of personalization that feels human? I decided to find out.
> The real hurdle was ensuring the emails seemed genuinely personalized and not spammy. I knew that if recipients detected even a whiff of a generic, mass-produced message, they'd tune out immediately.
> Incredibly, not a single recipient seemed to detect that the emails were AI-generated.
https://www.wisp.blog/blog/how-i-use-ai-agents-to-send-1000-...
The technical part surprised me: they string together multiple LLMs which do all the work. It's a shame the author's passions are directed towards AI slop-email spam, all for capturing attention and driving engagement.
How much of our societal progress and collective thought and innovation has gone to capturing attention and driving up engagement, I wonder.]]></summary>

Title: Ethical Individualism
Subtitle: Selected Texts
Date: 2019
Notes: Translated from French to English by Kirk Watson.

Translator‚Äôs Introduction
 At the dawn of the 20th century, Europe hosted a brief blossoming of individualistic thought. Inspired by the great thinkers of the preceding century such as Stirner, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and Spencer, they offered a free-thinking, non-dogmatic alternative to the increasingly powerful Marxists and syndicalists of the left, and the economists and theologians of the right. Importantly, this generation of thinkers developed the critique of the State into a critique of society as a whole, which immunized them from recruitment by the anarchist movement.

 Abuse is ubiquitous in our society, and as a result there are very few among us, if any, who have not been abused themselves or in proximity to someone else being abused. Myths about why and how abuse occurs run rampant and the ones that dominate are ones that ultimately serve in the maintenance of the status quo that keeps victims disempowered and silent. As a result, even those few who do actually believe victims of abuse and see the danger such abuse poses to them still often respond to the conditions the victim is entrapped within in ways that ultimately affirm the abuser‚Äôs narrative and fur‚Ä¶]]></summary>

The main purge was throwing out YEARS of old diaries and journals‚Äîall of them. Not one survived.
I've been thinking about doing this for a long time. Reading them made me feel horrible, and they all seemed to circle the same themes. Lugging those boxes full of journals to each new apartment felt tiresome. It was time to let them go.
I feel good about it. I'm free: to untangle myself from past narratives; from reinforcing and remembering things I don't wish to remember; to change; to reinvent the person I want to be.
Next on the to-get-rid-of list: books, clothes, paper ephemera, apps, expired kitchen things, tucked-away closet articles, + bathroom items.

There is a rough idea of what it will be about, but not much more than that. It usually works best this way, I think. As usual, my phone and computer are set to "do not disturb" when I'm writing.
Even the basic idea itself often comes out of some kind of void: when I'm walking, driving, or eating, for example. Poof! Suddenly something appears, like the characteristic light bulb symbol.
Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.
This is what Nikhil writes in the post Get Bored.
I think it's so well put. That's precisely how it is. Just as a document or canvas needs a blank surface to be used, we, as individuals, need an inner void to make room for creation.
Our lives are full of excellent opportunities to create these spaces. They're there every day: we're waiting for the elevator, we've stopped at a traffic light, or we're in line at the grocery store. Magnificent opportunities for a moment of ‚Äúboredom‚Äù ‚Äî an invitation to creativity.
Your best blog post ever could appear the next time you're on an escalator doing absolutely nothing.
‚ÄúBored to death‚Äù is the birth of creativity.

 The ecological crisis profoundly impacts the material conditions of social reproduction, extending beyond ‚Äúnatural disasters‚Äù to encompass a deepening of the contradictions inherent in capitalism. This crisis does not only manifest itself in events like floods, droughts, and pandemics, it also plays a direct role in fueling conflicts, social unrest, and mass displacement.

Wayne Price in turn has dedicated his mind to a task that at first seems wholly opposite to Carson‚Äôs: working to adapt Marxist economics and political strategy to an anarchist co‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.
But what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There‚Äôs no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there‚Äôs no sense of urgency in your mind, there‚Äôs calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.
When your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That‚Äôs when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.
Productivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That‚Äôs when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.
When you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a relatively new arrival to these shores having landed here to visit, but not stay and then, on meeting my partner, I began to visit more often till it was decided. I would stay, stay and pursue first, permanent residency and then, citizenship.
Well, after living here, in Quebec, long enough to apply, and sponsored by my partner, I applied to be a permanent resident. A lot of money later after being vetted like I was about to work at Los Alamos in New Mexico, on some Top Secret weapons program or with Aliens, I was finally cleared as being a desirable alien and given residency. Which afforded me certain rights and privileges.
From this point I had to be a resident for at least 3 years before I could then apply to become a citizen. Again, this is not an easy path or a cheap venture let me tell you. And, without the support of a sponsor‚Äîin my case, my partner‚Äînear on impossible to do. The financial requirement alone, is prohibitive to so many. But, me and mine persisted and finally, in August 2018, I passed the last hurdle in a very long and meticulous process to achieve citizenship. I presented myself to the relevant authorities, made a declaration signed my paperwork and was told I was at that point, barring any further complications, a citizen of Canada.
The finishing touch to make it all wholly official came later when, online, with about 100+ other participants, I swore the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, and sang O Canada in Canada's two official languages in front of a judge, online, with my fellow compatriots.
I was then officially a Canadian citizen. And I have never been more proud of myself, and my partner, at realising a dream.
And here I am, a few years later, on Canada Day, celebrating the fact I am a Canadian.
Happy Canada Day everyone! üá®üá¶

 Marxism shares one thing in common with other authoritarian ideologies: they are against the individual. Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or ‚Äúanti-state communists,‚Äù they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnarchism‚Äù or ‚ÄúSocialism‚Äù, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese‚Äôs Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. 
 The main gist of the essay is that individuals are not a real mate‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since WeblogPoMo ended in May, I've been stuck in some sort of writing rut. I'm still posting a few times a week so it may not be as obvious, but I've noticed myself living inside my head too much lately. And I think I need to get myself out.
As I always do, I've been overthinking about what I write and create. Rarely are things perfect enough for me to post, so they just kind of hang out in my drafts, or just stay written inside my head. Because of that, my head is now full of these nonsensical words, and I need to find a way to get them out.
I've been considering starting 100 days to offload, and I keep giving myself reasons to delay. I've told myself I'd start it in August for my birthday month, or maybe in November of NaBloPoMo (National Blog Posting Month in November), but honestly why wait? There's no better day than today to start, right? (But also because it‚Äôs a brand new month.)
So I guess here's my official 1st day post. 100 posts in a year. Check back with me in 364 days. I'll let you know how I did (or you can follow along!).
I'll be tracking my post here, or in my #100daystooffload tag. Come along for the ride ‚Äî I would love to have you around to (secretly or not so secretly) nudge me and keep me accountable.
Ready, set, go!

At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants‚Äô expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike.

Yes, there's a full city beneath those trees.
However, this is not what the land originally looked like.
To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It's known colloquially as eGoli, or "The City of Gold". Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don't have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it's mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.

The close environments of family, friends, and colleagues indeed have the most impact. So I never thought about the overarching environment I was part of, the city, the country. It is only over the past month I have been thinking about it.
It started with that famous hit-and-run case in Pune. Not the hit-and-run itself. But the coverup. The systemic failure. The corruption. The stories of this happening often and without any consequence all over the country, all the time.
Then it was the roof at the airport collapsing and killing a man. It is the traffic here in Bangalore. How no one cares about traffic rules. How the streets just fill up with water every time it rains. The power cuts. There is nothing new to all this. I grew up in India. It was all around me. I just ignored it.
I feel like I can't ignore it anymore. So the choice is to fix it or to leave. I have tried to fix things in my own way. It made me realise I live in a bubble and the majority of the country is much different from what I am. Or from where I want things to be. It needs a massive culture change.
To change it I will need to get political and dedicate my life. I am not willing to get into the shitshow that is politics nor want to dedicate my life to this. I want to do cool things in my life with cool people. And if I feel like the city or the country I live in blocks it. I will move.]]></summary>

What is Anarchism?
 Anarchism is a political theory which opposes the State and capitalism. It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one.

Introduction
 What if we didn‚Äôt need bosses, politicians, borders, landlords, police, or prisons? 
 There was a time when each of these things did not exist, and whatever you may believe now about their absolute necessity, have you considered that there can be a time again when we can do much better without them? 
 Anarchists dare to desire a world without rule. 
 Neither the rule of the minority nor the rule of the majority. Neither the rule of the capitalists nor the rule of the bureaucrats. Neither the rule of men nor the rule of royalty nor the rule of the elderly nor the rule of warlords. An-archy. Without rule.

 A lot of theories have surfaced in the relatively new millennium concerning the human species‚Äô relationship to the planet it calls home. Historically, the mechanized view on nature advocated in the 17th century Scientific Revolution is criticized by ecological movements as alienating humanity from its origins.

A large swath of research in mathematics education claims to serve an equity agenda. However, too often this research is conducted atheoretically, failing to disrupt the worldviews that produce injustice and oppression, for both the researcher and the reader. Responding to this commonplace divergence of intent and impact, we propose a methodological approach that anchors research and praxis in a sociopolitical foundation of anarchism. We seek cohesion of theory and practice by consciously demanding that values common to the equity agenda‚Äîcooperation, mutual a‚Ä¶]]></summary>

 In this text, written as a speech for the 1st Anarchist Fair in Rio de Janeiro, contradictions of the historically predatory relationship of brazilian democracy with brazilian travestis and transsexuals are presented, paying attention to the ontological marginality of the travesti body under the capitalist patriarchy of white supremacy.

 Making the shift to the consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that we can do to build a democratic society.

 Consensus creates true democracy‚Äînot the democracy in name only that sickens any aware person. Consensus empowers all who participate in it.

Abstract
 This paper proposes new perspectives on anarchism, indigeneity, and Afro-descendent struggles, by discussing the case of Brazilian anarchists‚Äô commitment to luta afroind√≠gena. They mean by this term the intersection of indigenous and Afro-descendant resistances for the recognition of land, against the violence of states, agribusiness, and extractivism. I argue that this case offers key insights to radical geographies, and to the broader field of decolonial scholarship, to challenge cultural and racial essentialisms by connecting different militant traditions.

It looked like they felt like they were about to drown every few minutes, hour, after hour, no relief. No IV fluids (terminal anyway, so no trying to keep them alive with techniques like that) and unable to drink, so certainly terribly thirsty the whole time. Unable to communicate or really engage with surroundings, and quite high on pain meds anyway (the closest thing to a mercy in all this). It‚Äôs fucked up that that‚Äôs a fairly normal way for dying people to make their exit. I‚Äôm sure there are all kinds of problems with trying to provide a way out when someone can‚Äôt make the choice for themselves, without opening it up to abuse, but damn, I hope this isn‚Äôt the best we can do because it‚Äôs terrible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Justice Kagan's dissent on page 82:
> This Court has long understood Chevron deference to reflect what Congress would want, and so to be rooted in a presumption of legislative intent. Congress knows that it does not‚Äîin fact cannot‚Äîwrite perfectly complete regulatory statutes...
> It knows that those statutes will inevitably contain ambiguities that some other actor will have to resolve, and gaps that some other actor will have to fill. And it would usually prefer that actor to be the responsible agency, not a court...
> Put all that together and deference to the agency is the almost obvious choice, based on an implicit congressional delegation of interpretive authority. We defer, the Court has explained, ‚Äúbecause of a presumption that Congress‚Äù would have ‚Äúdesired the agency (rather than the courts)‚Äù to exercise ‚Äúwhatever degree of discretion‚Äù the statute allows. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517
U. S. 735, 740‚Äì741 (1996).
> Today, the Court flips the script: It is now ‚Äúthe courts (rather than the agency)‚Äù that will wield power when Congress has left an area of interpretive discretion. A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris. In recent years, this Court has too often taken for itself decision-making authority Congress assigned to agencies. The Court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; its own judgment on climate change for that of the Environmental Protection Agency; and its own judgment on student loans for that of the Department of Education.]]></summary>

E.g, "we need to come up with a way to implement X". Person A gives their idea, person B gives another idea and so on until everybody shared their thoughts. Then someone would say "I think what person C said makes the most sense" and everybody would agree and that was it. 30 minutes to hear everybody out, 3 minutes to discuss who will do it and when and the meeting was over.

From the linked article (from Jan 2023):
  But sesame does differ in one distinct way from eggs, peanuts, shellfish, milk, and soy: The seeds are teeny tiny and hard to keep track of. This means they‚Äôre prone to ‚Äúcross-contamination,‚Äù in food-allergy terms. If you operate a bakery that makes sesame bagels, the odds are decent that rogue seeds will end up in your other products, too. Bad news for people with severe sesame allergies. But it‚Äôs also expensive and frustrating for food manufacturers to ensure the seeds are kept away from other foods, if they‚Äôre on the FDA‚Äôs major allergens list.
  
  Advocates have therefore been warning since December that the FASTER Act is poised to have a counter effect. Rather than minimize cross-contamination, as they argue the law requires, many big food brands have opted to add sesame to their bread products, then simply declare it as an ingredient. They are intentionally adding sesame flour to ‚Äúavoid complying with the spirit and intent of the FASTER Act,‚Äù FARE tells Fast Company. That is cheaper than certifying that their facilities are 100% sesame-free.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think there's a misunderstanding in what the settlement is about. As part of Purdue's bankruptcy, the Sackler family is voluntarily providing 6 billion dollars to help settle claims opioid victims have brought against Purdue Pharma.
As a condition to provide the 6 billion dollars, the Sackler family has asked the bankruptcy judge to not even allow any new suits against the Sacklers related to the Opioid epidemic. This is something bankruptcy courts do regular for the company Purdue Pharma, but it is irregular when it comes to the Sackler family (this is not the entity going bankrupt!)
This is the issue that went up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled that the protection given to the Sackler family is not something that can be given  by a bankruptcy judge during the bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma.

 On February 24, hundreds of anarchists in several cities across Europe took to the streets in solidarity with the people of Ukraine on the second anniversary of the start of full-scale Russian invasion. The Anarchist Bloc was at actions in Warsaw, Vilnius, Berlin, Tbilisi, Vienna and Zurich. It was important for us to express words of support to people from Ukraine, whose country has been tormented by the Kremlin‚Äôs aggression for two years, to applaud the steadfastness of all those who oppose this aggression with weapons in their hands, especially our comrades. 
 At the actions we included audio messages from anarchists, who right now are holding‚Ä¶]]></summary>

 As it became known from a propaganda video on youtube published by the state media, anarchists from the group ‚ÄúBlack Nightingales‚Äù were detained in Belarus several months ago. According to the regime‚Äôs version, they were planning to attack the state infrastructure and sabotage the support of the Russian military in Belarus. The list of the group members includes Maria Misyuk, Trofim Barysau, Sergey Zhigalyou, Dmitry Zahoroshko, Anastasia Klimenka, and Aleksandra Pulinovich. Based on the attitude of the Belarusian regime towards anarchists, we believe that any recorded testimony was obtained under torture until the co‚Ä¶]]></summary>

 No one doubted the ability of Vladimir Putin and his cohort to draw a 50%+ figure to maintain their own power. It would be naive to believe that any action in the controlled environment of the polling stations could affect the percentages displayed on the screens of the Russian empire and the entire planet. Whether you spoil a ballot, write a message on it, or nuke a polling station, Putin will still consistently win. 
 Smart voting, apps on phones and even prayers will not be able to influence the results of the vote. 
 But that‚Äôs not the victory we want to talk about today. Rather, we want to talk about the political victory around mobilizati‚Ä¶]]></summary>
