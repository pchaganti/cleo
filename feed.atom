I used to call America “the consumer of last resort.” If you wanted to get rich, if you wanted to industrialize, if you wanted to scale, you needed the American market. Europe sold to America, Japan sold to America, South Korea sold to America and China sold to America. This requirement is why Japan was forced to sign the Plaza Accords, which basically destroyed their future. Oh, life in Japan is fine now, but it’s no longer the roaring Tiger of the 80s.
But America has lost its place, which is why China was able to laugh in its face when Trump tried to use tariffs against it. His assumption was that China needed the American market. True 20 years ago. Maybe true 10 years ago. Not true now.

The (anti)Federalist Society assault on the Constitution, Part 1
GOP Budget Would Make It Even Harder to Hold Trump Administration in Contempt
Shawn Musgrave, May 24 2025 [The Intercept]
…The looming showdown over the judiciary’s power to issue contempt orders stems from a single sentence tucked into the thousand-page budget bill, which passed the House of Representatives by a single vote on Thursday.
“This is a slap in the face to the concept of separation of powers,” said a spokesman for Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.).
If enacted, the provision — found on page 544 out of 1,082 — would restrict how federal judges can hold government officials or other litigants in contempt if they defy court-issued injunctions and restrainin…]]></summary>

“If you have any idea about Russia’s history at war you will see time and time again from (CHarles the XII of Sweden) to Napoleon to Stalin the ability to absorb catastrophic initial losses over a number of years to then having large wins later on and we are seeing this.”

I would simply add that the Russians trade space for time, Remember that Ukrainian Offesive in 2023 that was gonna end the war?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While researching a post I promised on why France collapsed so quickly in World War Two I came across this video on the Russo-German Reinsurance Treaty. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It will give you a much more balanced view of the man–you’ll not be looking at him through the lens of World War Two or World War One for that matter.
Finally, I think all of us can agree that Disney Star Wars has been 90% joke. All except for Rogue One and the recently completed season two of Andor. As the Critical Drinker says, season two is “the kind of TV your sitting on the edge of your seat in complete silence knowing this is the kind of TV that comes along once every 5-10 years.”
I’ve re-evaluated my favorite Star Wars movies–not a single TV show, not even the silly Mandalorian makes the top five, except Andor. Obviously A New Hope is number one. Rogue One is number two, Empire Strikes Back is number three, Andor both seasons are #4 and number five is a toss up between Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.  What say you people?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ken Klippenstein, written by Elias Rodriguez
The Embassy shooter’s manifesto is short, to the point and entirely sane. I won’t wring my hands and say I think he was wrong, I will merely note that it is illegal to kill Israelis, and that unlike the butchers of Gaza, he will be punished.
Explication
May 20, 2025
Halintar is a word that means something like thunder or lightning. In the wake of an act people look for a text to fix its meaning, so here’s an attempt. The atrocities committed by Israelis against Palestine defy description and defy quantification. Instead of reading descriptions mostly we watch them unfold on video, sometimes live. After a few months of rapidly mounting death tolls Israel had obliterated the capacity to even continue counting the dead, which has served its ge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good start.
So, someone killed two Israeli diplomats in D.C. and everyone is crying crocodile tears and screaming about anti-semitism. (One of them was a Christian fundamentalist, as an aside.)
These two diplomats are agents of a genocidal state. Their job is to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Israel so that Israel can kill more Palestinians, wipe out the last remaining hospital, torture Palestinians, rape Palestinians (including, it appears, with dogs), deliberately snipe children in the head, cause a huge famine, and turn every building in Gaza into dust.
And I’ve left a number of sickening crimes out.
So, am I sad they are dead? No. Am I going to pretend I give a shit when someone who supports genocide winds up dead? No. Every single pious well wishing for Biden is the equivalent of wishing Petain, the leader of Vichy France, who helped the Holocaust along, a good life.
All of these people are knowingly involved in genocide. They have had many opportunities to stop supporting mass murder and they have refused every single one of them.
They are all, forgive me for using the word, evil. The bad guys. Torture. Rape. Mass murder. Deliberate killing of children.
It is my dream that every single one of them will eventually hang from the neck for their crimes. No exceptions. And I think it would be wise to add the corporate leadership of companies like Palantir and Microsoft, both of which are helping the genocide along.
This is a moral stance, but it is also a pragmatic stance. People who have gotten away with genocide once are not the sort of people anyone wise wants in their society, or in a position of power anywhere. Once could easily become twice.
You don’t even have to give a damn about Palestinians, you just have to have good judgment and a concern for your own neck and the lives, rectums and limbs of people you care about.
From the neck. Till dead. For everyone who knowing aided or committed genocide.
And, for a little leavening of the anger and rage, a classic:]]></summary>

This caused stocks to trend down and even the dollar. Simply put the US is adding a lot of debt, reducing revenue by cutting taxes and there’s wild amounts of uncertainties due to Trump’s tariff and trade policies. Bond traders are worried, Japan is reducing its Treasuries holdings, and everyone is looking imploringly at the Federal Reserve.
As a friend quipped “the economy is perfectly healthy, as long as we keep it on life support.”
Which is to say the likely result is that the Federal Reserve will have to step up and start buying Treasuries again. The last time it did that was during Covid.
