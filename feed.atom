Title: Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot
Subtitle: The necessity to write our own histories
Date: November 9th, 2024
Source: Retrieved on November 14th 2024 from https://bccounterinfo.org/2024/11/09/yintah-documentary-film-review-anarchists-in-the-blind-spot-or-the-necessity-to-write-our-own-histories/

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them. Except …]]></summary>

My wife is going through a lot of things right now, and me being home hasn't been the best thing for our bank account but I think it's the best thing for us right now. Sadly, all of this came together at the same time as the election, my birthday, and the upcoming holidays which is making for an even more stressful time than typical.
To make matters a bit worse, I haven't felt good about retreating into the places that I typically do. A lot of my blogging friends are in pain over the election. My Mastodon feed is depressing, as is most of my RSS. So, I haven't really had a place to just breathe online, which has led me to avoid the internet more than usual.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit "weird" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days before I arrived in Canberra, an aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted the celebration of King Charles III to say, “You are not my king. This is not your land.” It was a powerful demonstration against the treatment of Australia ever since the arrival of English ships to the country’s east in January 1788. In fact, the British crown does claim title to the entirety of the Australian landmass. King Charles III is head of the 56-country Commonwealth and the total land area of the Commonwealth takes up 21 percent of the world’s total land. It is quite remarkable to realize that King Charles III is nominally in charge of merely 22 percent less than Queen Victoria (1819-1901). More

We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group. We talked about the poor man’s David Tennant in our group and B’s weird partner who made them a really elaborate card that B felt burdened by.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China's income level. We quantify China's consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country's production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.]]></summary>

Here's a start --
"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
"Who uses Keras in production": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
"Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering & architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!]]></summary>

Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.]]></summary>

My life before knowing about small web
And my life after knowing it.
What is the small web?
My quick, not complete answer, using an example: Personal websites/blogs people are making and hosting themselves are part of the small web.
You can find many of these websites here:
https://blogroll.org

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn't one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don't have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it's fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that's okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don't want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!]]></summary>

We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things "they shouldn't be" was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feeling melancholic.
I don't know what it is. It could be the rain, or it could be because it's Monday. Either way, I'm feeling all the feels today1. I'm currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather's got a mood, and it's contagious.
I love the sound of rain. I think it's soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it's Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.
Maybe it's just one of those days. I've done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.
And so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don't quite know what to do with just yet.
That's all.

It’s a wet day here too. A sort of stead drizzle that just envelops everything in tiny teardrops. Hope you feel less melancholy tomorrow and maye, the sun will come out.

What are embeddings?
Embeddings let you turn an arbitrary piece of text into a series of numbers that manage to represent the meaning of the content. These embedding vectors can range in dimension from 512 on the shorter end all the way up to 8192 or more. Typically each of the weights in the vector is represented as a 32-bit floating point number.
LLMs use embeddings to represent input text, but embeddings can also be used on their own.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside, calling out to see if anyone was there. An old, weathered hand raised itself from behind a towering pile, and a soft, respectful voice answered, “What do you want, sir?”
Startled, I scanned the room until I spotted an old man in the midst of this sea of books. “Hi,” I replied. “Is this a library or an old bookshop?” He chuckled and explained that it was a private libra…]]></summary>

I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I've been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization. The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Sunday:) just popping in to let you know I've added Monstrous Existence vol. 3 to the shop this morning.
It's a one-page (double-sided) zine about being saddened by the election results, needing a break, starting a new sketchbook, + a mini music list, doodles, and scattered thoughts.
This zine is a limited print of 30 copies. Each copy has red marker accents that are unique to each print.
Made with love ❤︎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the FT put it: “In the end, it wasn't even close. A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife's edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump's 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple's ads for "Apple Intelligence" comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly "save the day" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect "perfection" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.]]></summary>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown. 
 Wolfe describes such charter cities as “special economic economic zones that are still bound by criminal law but able to create their own c…]]></summary>

He raises some good points about one specific section of the post - that being, the part where I mention that I wish there were comment sections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the "aliveness" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label "life" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.
Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?
The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.]]></summary>
