        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a lot of talk about the social network Bluesky lately. If you have an account there and want to show your latest status update on your blog, here's an easy way to do that.
Vincent Will has put together a script named bsky-embed. All you need to do is enter your username and modify the settings to your liking. I've added it to the footer using this setup:
<div class="bluesky">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bsky-embed/dist/bsky-embed.es.js" async></script>
<bsky-embed
  username="birming.com"
  limit="1"
  load-more="false"
  custom-styles=".border-slate-300 { border: none; }"
>
</bsky-embed>
</div>

The bluesky div class is my own addition, giving the widget a style that matches the Bearming Theme. Here's the CSS styling for that:
/* Bluesky */
.bluesky {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 10px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: inherit;
  text-align: left;
  background: var(--accent-color);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

Good luck!]]></summary>

Well, for this birthday edition of our restoration project, the 307 engine has completed its full rebuild. While much of the details of how this is all done went way over my head, what I do know is all the shiny bits from the last post now live inside the engine. Not to understate the amount of back-breaking labour my father went through to get it all set up, but the orange boi has all the requisite parts strapped on and is ready to rock and roll!

It was with much excitement and a little trepidation that I approached the milestone of this engine's 55th birthday compared to my measly 34 years of age. Would these shiny bits of expensive metal, meticulously installed into the bowels of this mysterious orange machine, reignite its thumping heartbeat in a flurry of noise and smoke?

What is interesting is that, by United Nations treaty, a country claims 12 nautical miles as its territorial limit; this means a large part of the waters are within Yemen’s jurisdiction. More

The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine.

Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today's newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I've always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.
Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.

They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.

Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.]]></summary>

前一段时间发现自己在浑噩过日子，并不是像一具行尸走肉，而是缺少自律的可持续的沉淀过程。熟悉我的朋友可能知道，我运营了一个名叫不求甚解的 Telegram 频道，这是我的得意之作，也是我的心头之痛。为什么这么讲，得意的是因为我在运营这个介质的同时获得了诸多关注和肯定，难过的是我经常缺少更新它的动力。
但是我经常思考。是的，作为一个 INTJ-A，我是非常喜欢思考，人生经历了 30 多年，到达了现在的阶段，我已经养成了时刻思考的能力和习惯，但是我缺少系统化沉淀的动作。
所以，我准备开启我人生的新阶段 ———— 养成自律的思考到沉淀的链路。
How
我准备按照时间周期的维度产出一些内容：
[Daily] 每天在这里写日记，哪怕是流水账；
[Weekly] Telegram 频道一周至少 3 更；
[Monthly] 召集思想同频的小伙伴录制播客。
Specially
需要说明几点，以上产出的内容，都是为了我自己，如果能帮助到此刻正在看的你，我很荣幸，但这不是我的职责以及初心。
最后，除了上面那些看起来很高大上的原因外，另外一个让我开始想要系统化记录自己生活的原因，是因为我看到了我的朋友 61 正在这么做，能够通过他的内容中感受到他对生活的热爱以及快乐，我也同样需要这些。
以上，祝各位都好。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For what it's worth, I've worked at multiple places that ran shell scripts just fine for their deploys.
- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.
- One was in an industry that didn't need "Webscale" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.
Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.
The place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.
I don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A contradictory title from someone who lives in a country that is among the world's largest coffee consumers, and who loves a Swedish fika.
The title, of course, refers to the "Buy Me a Coffee" buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it's often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn't feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it's a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian "jantelagen" (Law of Jante). I don't know.
I don't blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it's nice to know that I don't "have to." And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you're ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I'll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️]]></summary>

If you find yourself working under such people, don't bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.
The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don't yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.

That's my spontaneous answer.
And it's true—but far from the whole truth. It became obvious when I chose to write without blogging during the week.
I felt creatively stifled. As if everything I created was never really complete. A gallery with paintings lacking frames.
For me, blogging is so much more than publishing texts. I like to tinker with the design and format the texts with a "digital mentality." I like my blogging workflow and everything surrounding it.
I blog because I love blogging.

Me: "What do you mean? Like next week?"
Her: "No, like next round, when we do this again."
She'd meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn't have the heart to tell her there wouldn't be a next round. I said I didn't know, and that I'd have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she'd asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it's when we meet.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I don't doubt that many people have the opposite experience. It just makes me feel a bit alien when I read comments like this.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been thinking back to that wonderful week I had in the summer when I had no social media on my phone. How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it'll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).
The issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn't an issue for me last time, this time I'm still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don't want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can't help but go to my phone whenever I'm bored, no matter how much I try to help it.
I've been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I've taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.]]></summary>

Subscriptions are a necessary evil these days. It seems like everyone wants to you to subscribe to whatever they offer and as much as I try to avoid subscriptions, I still have a huge list of them I pay for each month.
I try to take advantage of annual sales around Black Friday and so I thought now would be a good time to recap what I've subscribed to this past year and see whether or not I found value in the subscription. If anyone else makes a list like this, please let me know, I love unbiased opinions on these sorts of things.

During elementary school, my Mom was married to a non-believer, so she didn't attend church, but my siblings and I went with a neighbor to a Southern Baptist church on the outskirts near the prison. My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).
In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It …]]></summary>

We do not recognize Putin’s view of NATO as a beast with encircling claws. At the same time, Russians can be forgiven for thinking that the Western narrative is not quite as defensive as it seems. “The spread of our values makes us safer” declared Tony Blair in Chicago in 1999, justifying NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia. This sets out the ground for forcible regime change when the opportunity offers. The underlying message is that democracy is the peaceful, dictatorship the warlike form of the state, so a war for democracy is necessarily a war for peace. Many Western analysts view the war in Ukraine as a war for regime change in Russia, which is why they cannot contemplate anything less than a Ukrainian victory. More

The other dev, Anastasia Opara, is a big name in the procedural graphics world. She gave one of my favorite presentations on the topic a few years ago [2].

So when those times have occurred I've (we've more accurately) adopted what I refer to the "deer in the headlights" response to just about anything non-trivial.  "Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take."  Then you'll get asked to "ballpark it" because that's what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done "ahead of time" and look good.
Now, I've had good managers who totally didn't need this strategy, and I loved 'em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can't be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.]]></summary>
