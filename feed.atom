 "The Reorganization of Zapatista Autonomy" is excerpted from Jérôme Baschet’s The Zapatista Experience: Rebellion, Resistance, and Autonomy, out this fall with AK Press. Although the book was first published in Mexico in 2019, the English translation contains new material not in the Spanish original, including a valuable description of the reorganization of Zapatista political structures that has been underway over the past year. As Baschet observes, this transformation, announced by the Zapatistas at the end of 2023, is an attempt to address a series of limitations and obstacles that have beset their communities for some ti…]]></summary>

 In the early beginnings of Freedom, some sixteen years ago, there was in our paper an article, entitled ‘Local Action’, which attracted at that time a good deal of attention in Socialist circles. Till then, the workers had been told that the socialisation of the factories, the mines and so on, could only be accomplished by the State, by an Act of Parliament. However, the Paris Commune had commenced, since 1871, a new era of communal revolutions. It had indicated to us that, in all probability, the Social Revolution would begin in many points of every territory at once. A number of Communes would start it themselves, on their own account; and they would s…]]></summary>

 People are often drawn to the study of labour history because they want to understand how to change the world. It is thought that the history of class struggle contains within itself not only a series of events and dates laid out in chronological order but also lessons. Through studying the history of class struggle we can establish with evidence what strategies and tactics work or do not work, why movements grow and why they collapse, what challenges social movements will have to overcome and so on. The necessity of studying history emerges from the fact that socialists cannot run scientific experiments in a laboratory and thereby establish the definitive formula for revolution.

 For far too long have radical communities and their discourses treated domestic violence and abuse as external from the considerations of revolutionary struggle. Abuse is seen as simply an interpersonal issue, springing from individual pathology which we must address by correcting certain behaviors and teaching better communication skills. The intervention tools of choice are frequently limited to restorative or transformative justice practices, with the ultimate aim of protecting and maintaining the abuser’s place in the community, often at the cost of surv…]]></summary>

 By the early 1900s, James Connolly, with the Irish Socialist Republican Party still struggling to make an impression on the Irish political scene, had become aware of the American Socialist Labor Party, which seemed to be attaining some successes under the energetic leadership of Daniel DeLeon. The context for Connolly’s learning of the SLP and DeLeon was a debate within the Second International on the question of socialist parties making alliance with bourgeois parties: DeLeon and his SLP were fiercely opposed to such marriages of convenience, as were Connolly and the ISRP.

In a matter of days they were able to drive out government forces and claim control over Aleppo, the country’s most populous city.

 Juan García Oliver gave a lecture at a union hall in the El Clot district to an exclusively worker audience on the parallels between Socrates and Christ’s lives. He was extremely eloquent and expounded original ideas as he shared his knowledge of the Socratic philosophy with the workers. And if the speaker is admirable—this young man who gave himself an exceptional education in hours robbed from sleep and during long years spent in prison—the same can be said of the audience.

 Our movement is often criticized for its lack of ideological content and this objection is perhaps not without foundation. Nevertheless, we are victims of a lack of understanding and misinterpretation. 
 If we compare our movement with those in other countries, I sincerely believe that its ‘theories’ are not brilliant.

 The hard period of pistolerismo was between 1917 and 1923, the time of Martínez Anido, the time of the legalisation of extrajudicial murders through the infamous Ley de Fugas, the time of state terrorism with Bravo Portillo’s gang and later with the Sindicatos Libres. Violence and state terrorism cost the lives of more than 500 libertarian militants. For its part, anarchism responded with the same weapons, the creation of so-called affinity or action groups made up of a small number of militants, to avoid betrayals which they were …]]></summary>

By accelerating revenue and driving increased profitability, he made New Relic one of the most broadly adopted platforms in its category. Staples has nearly 30 years of experience building developer platforms and serving developers as customers. Prior to New Relic, he spent many years at Microsoft and Adobe in executive leadership roles, building and scaling several multi-billion-dollar businesses.
On a burner account as I am a New Relic employee.
Bill Staples was a nice enough guy, but at New Relic he was specifically brought in as CEO to get the company prepared to be sold. Which is the exact same thing he did at Marketo before that.
He has no relevant tech experience, except when it comes to preparing a company to be sold in the next 2-3 years.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI is racing against two clocks: the commoditization clock (how quickly open-source alternatives catch up) and the monetization clock (their need to generate substantial revenue to justify their valuation).
The ultimate success of this strategy depends on what we might call the enterprise AI adoption curve - whether large organizations will prioritize the kind of integrated, reliable, and "safe" AI solutions OpenAI is positioning itself to provide over cheaper but potentially less polished alternatives.
This is strikingly similar to IBM's historical bet on enterprise computing - sacrificing the low-end market to focus on high-value enterprise customers who would pay premium prices for reliability and integration. The key question is whether AI will follow a similar maturation pattern or if the open-source nature of the technology will force a different evolutionary path.]]></summary>

In other words, it's a con. I'm a paying Perplexity user, and Perplexity already does this same sort of reasoning. At first it seemed impressive, then I started noticing mistakes in topics I'm an expert in. After awhile, I started realizing that these mistakes are present in almost all topics, if you check the sources and do the reasoning yourself.
LLMs are very good at giving plausible answers, but calling them "intelligent" is a misnomer. They're nothing more than predictive models, very useful for some things, but will ALWAYS be the wrong tool for the job when it comes to verifying truth and reasoning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article’s headline is rather misleading (I assume unintentionally), because it omits that the actual seizure and data access was done pursuant to warrants. Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.
Here, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.
In this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.

By taxing imports, domestic prices become relatively cheaper, and Americans switch expenditure from foreign goods to domestic goods, thereby expanding the domestic industry. In a recent Liberty Street Economics post, we highlighted that our recent study found large aggregate losses to the U.S. from the U.S.-China trade war. Here, we delve into the cross-sectional patterns in search of segments of the economy that may have benefited from import protection. What we find, instead, is that most firms suffered large valuation losses on tariff-announcement days. We also document that these financial losses translated into future reductions in profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity.]]></summary>

 Coercive control, a framework originally conceptualized in Evan Stark’s Coercive Control: How Men Entrap Women in Everyday Life and widely utilized in domestic violence theory, is one that can be expanded to understand the tactics and underlying values of all forms of authoritarian control. I have argued for this in other essays and have alluded to how an understanding of domestic violence can sharpen one’s political analysis of authoritarianism in other forms. In this essay, I will demonstrate just how such an analysis can be applied to better understand the tact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from "ordinary expenses" as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people's intuition of what "living paycheck-to-paycheck" means. That isn't nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.
There is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; "ordinary" is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as "ordinary". By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.
By contrast, the median US household has >$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as "ordinary" and therefore not saving it. The categories of "non-ordinary" expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.
The implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.
Americans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.]]></summary>

On the second floor of the hotel, the company's annual investor conference continued seemingly without interruption as news of the shooting was just beginning to spread. Attendees mingled over cups of coffee, shaking hands and talking shop. "Someone got shot outside," one attendee said to another as they made their way up from the lobby. Others took photos of the news crews gathering outside on their phones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During 2018-19, the U.S. levied import tariffs of 10 to 50 percent on more than $300 billion of imports from China, and in response China retaliated with high tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. Estimating the aggregate impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy is challenging because tariffs can affect the economy through many different channels. In addition to changing relative prices, tariffs can impact productivity and economic uncertainty. Moreover, these effects can take years to become apparent in the data, and it is difficult to know what the future implications of a tariff are likely to be. In a recent paper, we argue that financial market data can be very useful in this context because market participants have strong incentives to carefully analyze the implications of a tariff announcement on firm profitability through various channels. We show that researchers can use movements in asset prices on days in which tariffs are announced to obtain estimates of market expectations of the present discounted value of firm cash flows, which then can be used to assess the welfare impact of tariffs. These estimates suggest that the trade war between the U.S. and China between 2018 and 2019 had a negative effect on the U.S. economy that is substantially larger than past estimates.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want the FBI to be disbanded.  Forever. I’ve wanted this to happen since 1970.  When the Senate hearings led by Franck Church revealed the extent of the FBI’s (and the CIA’s) infiltration of political and cultural organizations a couple years later, my hatred of the agency multiplied a hundredfold.  That being said, I don't want the FBI to be replaced by a Donald Trump-run national police agency—a TBI, if you will. For those who don’t know and those who don’t remember, Richard Nixon tried to remake the FBI in his image back in the early 1970s.  He got very close to doing so.  According to what I’ve been able to parse over the years in my reading, conversation and other research, a big reason Nixon failed in turning the FBI into his own private police force was the presence of another powerful reactionary. That was the long time director of the Agency, J. Edgar Hoover, who only ended his directorship by dying. More

* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week.

They bought Mellanox, but that can be used by anyone, so there's no lock-in for now.
As a tangent, NVIDIA has a whole set of standards for pumping tremendous amount of data in and out of these mesh of cards. Let it be GPU-Direct storage or specialized daemons which handle data transfers on and off cards.
If you think that you can connect n cards on PCIe bus and just send workloads to them and solve problems magically, you'll hurt yourself a lot, both performance and psychology wise.
You have to build a stack which can perform these things with maximum possible performance to be able to compute with NVIDIA. It's not just emulating CUDA, now. Esp., on the high end of the AI spectrum (GenAI, MultiCard, MultiSystem, etc.).
For other lower end, multi-tenant scenarios, they have card virtualization, MIG, etc. for card sharing. You have to complete on that, too, for cloud and smaller applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read Steven's blog post this morning about imposter syndrome and the feelings that arise about sharing one’s work.
I embody those same sentiments.
A lot of my friends and family don’t know I blog or make zines. This breaks my heart because I consider these creative pursuits a big part of my life. It’s what I spend the most time thinking about.
Only recently have I nonchalantly told my bf about my website and zine making. It felt like a big deal sharing that information bc I'm such a private person, but I don't think he's checked it out yet.

It's been seven months since I started my weekly email letters, and I've put so much work into these missives.
I've asked people to financially support my email letters, but unfortunately, it's not panning out, and I'm unsure how to move forward.
Working towards something without moving the needle doesn't feel good.
It sucks to admit failure, and it sucks that it's not working out. Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn't enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.
Much self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making. When my efforts prove financially unsuccessful, it feels like a direct hit to my purpose/aim in life, which is a terrible feeling to reconcile. I have no idea how to untangle this.
Do I hit delete on my online efforts/website and write anonymously somewhere else? Perhaps.]]></summary>

I’m just reacting, then reacting some more, and clinging onto anything that’ll get me through the day.
Living in such a way has no doubt created a bit of an identity crisis for me. I haven’t had this much free time to just feel myself out and discover the true me. Interestingly, things haven’t gone exactly the way I thought they would.

 From the 5th to the 7th of July, Prishtina, Kosova, transformed into a hub of anarchist thought, coordination, and solidarity as it hosted the 16th edition of the Balkan Anarchist Bookfair (BAB). This first-ever anarchist gathering in an Albanian-speaking locality brought together over 250 participants from 29 countries, spanning from Chile to Azerbaijan. A total of 32 collectives and initiatives exhibited books and zines, and 18 discussions and events were organized, showcasing the movement’s all-encompassing diversity. In the true spirit of collectivism and mutual aid, participants got engage…]]></summary>

This is what I believe:
The Universe is Neutral. It Neither Loves Nor Hates You - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that "everything will be all right" because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I've been thinking about this for a while but couldn't gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn't work long-term. You don't smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you're never free from the thought "I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now." That's why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn't help me), or some other activity where you don't think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it's simply a fact I didn't want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that's it. I don't see anything wrong with games if they don't interfere with main tasks and don't cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people's blogs. Until recently, I didn't even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people's posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I'm very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it's much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.]]></summary>

This resulted in the system quoting wrong balances for post offices, and when that didn't match the actual cash in hand, resulted in prosecutions of the postmasters responsible for those offices which in turn led to convictions, dismissals, fines, imprisonments, and suicides over a 15 year period as the computer system was presumed correct.
Anyway, it was later proven the computer system was incorrect but the government there dragged their heels on exoneration and compensation.

Nothing here has felt meaningful in quite a while.

I wanted this to be fun, and it was. I enjoyed it for a long time. But now it just feels like work, and that’s something I just don’t want it to be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn't waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.
Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, "I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....," which was code for "I want the night off."
I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.]]></summary>

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.]]></summary>

 Everything has its cost: our time, once spent, can be bought back neither by king nor trillionaire. We give up our time for what we do not want; 10-20 years for a house, 5-10 for a car, 50-100 hours per month for food, then phone bills, utilities, holiday gifts, shopping shopping shopping. We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt. Our careers become our lives. 
 In exchange for lost time we reproduce ourselves as obedient laborers, our consciousness accepts the global economic system as not only necessary but good, our taxes directly fund the imperialist monstrosities of the day, while our contribution to the GDP indirectly funds them.

 One of the most pressing questions in our organization at the moment pertains to the anarchist’s influence in the unions. I remember past times when anarchists, who shunned rather than sought organizational posts, were seen as the best guarantee of revolutionary success, thanks to their moral solvency and especially their revolutionary intransigence. But apparently things have changed and now it is that very intransigence that is attacked most harshly.

Title: Not even if they order it, Captain!
Date: 3 March 1933
Notes: Written in response to Captain Rojas, who when asked why he carried out the Casas Viejas massacre, responded that he was following orders. Originally published in Solidaridad Obrera. English translation by Churck Morse.

 Captain, I’ve seen my comrades fall in slow death throes and then collapse on the ground, blood pouring out of their mouths, while life flees through small holes in their foreheads. These holes of death crush the skulls of their victims and comprehension in those who reflect upon them. Anido and Arlegui ordered it. 
 I’ve seen kicks destroy teeth, eyebrows, and lips; men fall unconscious only to be revived with pails of water…]]></summary>

Now it’s just a way to make the number perpetually go up, sucking every last drop of value out of the system.

Title: The State and Social Economy
Date: 1902
Notes: Note In this text, taken from Pages of Social History, the author dismantles the idea that the state is a useful tool for the emancipation of the working class and that it can be used as a point of passage towards the stateless and classless society, as sustained by Marxists and social-democrats alike.

 If the fatalist law had turned many Socialists from the economic struggle, and driven the masses exclusively into electoral agitation, that would have been an evil, but only a partial one. For example, in Germany, where the Social Democratic party boasts so remarkable a success, the conditions of labor are far worse not only than in England, where th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I wrote about needing to quit social media again, and I was debating internally even more after that. I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam's post about social media, and it clicked for me.
I deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.
What I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I've grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I've had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.
Now that I'm unshackled again, I'm making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I'm tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I'm doing the same for other people.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The scary part is not the GPS installed by the fleet company that previously owned the car, which in all likelihood was just forgotten there, but the GPS and eSIM that comes with most (all?) new cars and that in most (all?) new cars cannot be disabled.
Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with "driver impairment" tech which was called a "kill switch". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just "sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements" and "block the driver from operating the vehicle". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497
Anyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I'll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.]]></summary>
