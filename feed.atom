Title: The Gaza Ghetto Uprising
Date: May 2024
Source: <brooklynrail.org/2024/05/field-notes/The-Gaza-Ghetto-Uprising>

 TO THE HEART OF IT: Gaza has been a free kill zone and a “concentration camp” (to quote Israel’s National Security Director Giora Eiland in 2004), long before October 7. 
 In light of this, the most radical position comes directly from the simplest question: are Palestinians human beings? If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. 
 Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?
All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.]]></summary>

It's quite a simple solution, using tags and the Bear class_name snippet. Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I'm planning to create an Apple Shortcut.
I've also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:
RSS Feed for All Content
RSS Feed for Blog Posts
RSS feed for Status Updates
Let me know if you're interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.
Wishing you a great weekend!]]></summary>

At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate’s potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am kind of frustrated by the widespread misunderstandings in this thread.
Laws are best when they are abstract, so that there is no need for frequent updates and they adapt to changing realities. The European "cookie law" does not mandate cookie banners, it mandates informed consent. Companies choose to implement that as a banner.
There is no doubt that the goals set by the law are sensible. It is also not evident that losing time over privacy is so horrible. In fact, when designing a law that enhances consumer rights through informed consent, it is inevitable that this imposes additional time spent on thinking, considering and acting.
It's the whole point, folks! You cannot have an informed case-by-case decision without spending time.]]></summary>

It's 9:30 PM, and I'm rushing a bit because I'm tired, so this is just going to be a rough overview of my thoughts—but $SMCI is shaping up to be something truly special. As of today (November 14th, 2024), I’m officially long on it and have structured my position in some unique ways. It's a "Texas-Hedge" to say the least...
Of course, we need to weigh the risks. But before diving into that, it’s crucial to understand why $SMCI has fallen off a cliff from $122.90 (split-adjusted) on March 8 of this year to $17.70 as of today.

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them.

Yes there seems to be lots of potential. Yes we can brainstorm things that should work. Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it's a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it's incredibly hard to hide those from them.
Show me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.
LLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don't have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It's a really hard problem with LLM based tools.
There is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we've exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?
I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It's my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.
GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.
For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build "expert bots" that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.
If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.
Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.
Chasing after model improvements and "GPT-5 will be PHD-level" is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.
Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don't know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.
Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That's a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.]]></summary>

In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit "weird" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.]]></summary>

We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group. We talked about the poor man’s David Tennant in our group and B’s weird partner who made them a really elaborate card that B felt burdened by. The conversation was vivid and true to life, and I texted B about it when …]]></summary>

As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP's mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game. OP's mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.]]></summary>

It would be so useful for so many applications – I'm a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless.

One thing I absolutely despise is elitism is any form, followed closely by gatekeeping. Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That's why I don't find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It's an attempt to bring something conjured in one's creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China's income level. We quantify China's consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country's production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.]]></summary>

Here's a start --
"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
"Who uses Keras in production": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
"Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering & architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!]]></summary>

There's a lot to untangle into where I ended up and how and why, and the sense of lingering impermanence that's run through this year. But that doesn't matter right now. What does matter is that I met a lot of weird little guys and I want to share them with you.
There's good cats out there. Take a pet no problem.
Tove (Edinburgh, UK)
Tove is not my cat, but she is the cat I live with. She's also less a cat than some kind of cross between a small bird and a meringue, making her strange little chirps for attention all hours of the day. She used to be a terribly shy and anxious thing but has grow…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn't one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don't have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it's fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that's okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don't want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!]]></summary>

The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who's behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who's ahead can be nurtured.
We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things "they shouldn't be" was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It's such a crying shame.]]></summary>

I lost a Stripe dispute of USD $210 because the customer that purchased tickets from my site used an email that he claimed to his bank was not his. Stripe and the bank asked me to provide evidence that this wasn't fraudulent and I sent them:
The invoice sent to the email the customer entered

When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.]]></summary>

Deciding to shake off the weekend haze, I went out and found myself wandering the streets of BTM. Suddenly, a small shop caught my eye, filled to the brim with books—as if there were no bricks in the walls, only shelves and stacks of paperbacks and hardcovers. Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside, calling out to see if anyone was there. An old, weathered hand raised itself from behind a towering pile, and a soft, respectful voice answered, “What do you want, sir?”
Startled, I scanned the room until I spotted an old man in the midst of this sea of books. “Hi,” I replied. “Is this a library or an old bookshop?” He chuckled and explained that it was a private libra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.


Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiency, you can check some of Polars benchmark here.
I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I've been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization. The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.
There has always been this thought in the bac…]]></summary>
