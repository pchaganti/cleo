        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39973150</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird"/>
        <updated>2024-04-08T20:01:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN.  Eric Seidel here (former lead of Flutter & Dart at Google, prev. YC S06).
I founded Flutter and led the team for almost a decade.  One of the constant questions we got was would we support code push like the web/react native: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14330  I left Google about a year ago and set out to build a company around Flutter and decided to start with code push.
It took us a year to build.  We had to build a new toolchain for Dart and a custom interpreter (for store compliance).  But it works!  Our beta has already been used by thousands of apps.  Most (eventually all) of the code is open source on GitHub.
I’ll be around all day to answer Flutter and Shorebird questions.  We run our company in the public on Discord and are happy to take questions there too.  Would love to hear your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Brazilian and when I moved back home for a bit the country had recently inaugurated a national exam for all high-schoolers. About maybe a year after, they'd publish an anonymized data set for researchers with a nice question-by-question breakdown of how every student performed. I worked at a school at the time, and one thing we wanted to know was how WE had performed in the questions so we could gauge if there were some things our students were consistently unprepared for.
They didn't provide that data, but it turns out with a little bit of grokking and staring at that 10gb text file, you could reverse engineer it so you could extract all the kids of a given school, and aggregate all of their answers. I produced a nice little report for our admins, with the questions of the text next to how we had performed in the aggregate and state averages, as well as averages of our "competitor schools."
The best part, though, is how I remember it being a bit "bullshit" that we, a private school, could afford to do this, but since the data was actually valuable to inform practice, surely the department of education should do that for every school! Whelp, over the weekend, I computed that info for every school in the dataset, and just stored a CSV for every school in an S3 instance (this was my ridiculous caching strategy lol). Spun up a frontend where you could select your school, and nicely visually go through every question, as well as print a pdf summary of the whole thing. On Monday morning tweeted at an ed journalist, and in a few days had a spread of me in the country's top newspaper, and people emailing about jobs "at my company."
This was the most rewarding project I've ever done, and I'm sad to say nothing has come close since. It cost me $0, produced a public good that I could see was being accessed from every state in the whole country, was technically interesting, and I saw it through from start to finish over the weekend!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.]]></summary>

England’s nobility and clergy pressed for parliamentary reform to block King John and his son Edward III from submitting to Rome’s demands to take on debts to finance its crusading and fights against Germany’s kings. Popes responded by excommunicating reformers and nullifying the Magna Carta again and again during the 13th century. More

Every life event - immigrating, getting a job, getting married, having a child, buying a car - is mired in slow, paper-based bureaucracy.

Just last week, I was telling people that the best way to get married in Germany is to get married in Denmark.
I cannot overstate how terrible German bureaucracy is, and how defeating it is to deal with it. A lot of people give up and leave the country over it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m more worried about the fact that it was allowed for so long. Sure, we’re doing the right thing by quitting PFAS and starting major cleanup efforts.
But the system existed where people were incredibly negligent for years, knew they were hurting people, made boatloads of money, and retired. That same system exists in many oil-and-gas industries, drug marketing, and more. There are dozens of examples where this has happened in recent years, and that’s just the ones at large enough scale to be prosecuted.
It’s still happening to this day. How do we start treating intentional negligence that leads to mass suffering and death as seriously as murder? It is individuals making these decisions, and they need to be held personally liable.
The corporate veil is useful, and shouldn’t go away completely. But when an individual makes a decision that had a high probability of doing major harm, they should at least stop and raise the issue to a government agency, to limit their liability. If they do not take appropriate precautions, like getting explicit approval from government authorities, then they should be personally liable for the negligence.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image by Markus Spiske.
Published in 1936, “Shooting an Elephant” remains one of George Orwell’s most celebrated essays. In it, the English writer recounts an incident from his time as a police officer in modern day Myanmar, then known as Burma, part of the British Empire. Responding to calls of a rampaging elephant, Orwell finds the animal docile, but nevertheless feels compelled to kill it, rather than appear weak before the crowd who has gathered to watch. In allowing his conscience to be overwhelmed, he experiences how colonialism dehumanizes not just the colonized, but the colonizers as well.
“I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys,” writes Orwell. “He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy …. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.”
Although Orwell is writing specifically of the British Empire, he quite clearly intends for his essay to be read more broadly, as applicable to contemporary fascism in Europe as British colonialism in Asia. And so too does his insight extend to today in the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure people in these comments are reading this paper correctly.
This seems to essentially disprove the whole idea of multi-agent setups like Chain-of-thought and LLM-Debate.
Because this paper introduces their alternative method which simply runs the same query multiple times on the same LLM, without any context shared across queries. And then they run a similarity algorithm on the answers and pick the most common answer. (Which makes sense to me. If an LLM is giving you a mixture of "hallucinations" and correct answers, the correct answers will similar and the hallucinations will hopefully be chaotic)
And this simple algorithm preform just as well (and sometimes better) than all the other multi-agent algorithms.
This suggests that the other multi-agent schemes with their clever prompts aren't really doing anything special; Their improve results are coming mostly from the fact that the LLM is run multiple times, that the prompt asks the LLM to pick the best answer.]]></summary>

They sent me a screenshot of the fire danger map where clearly it had the wrong location / coordinates for my address (they thought I was about a mile from where I really live).
I pointed them to my address on Google Maps which has my correct location, but they said their system isn't wrong and the address coordinate mapping can't be changed anyway. Go away.
Then another insurance company told me the same thing. I thought maybe I was going to be uninsurable completely based off of a computer error.
Luckily, Lemonade has smarter systems and got my location right, so I was able to get insured with them. But I'm not sure what I would do without lemonade.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I spent years working and building 0-1 insurance products. Let me peel back some stuff that’s been happening behind the scenes.
Some officials are elected and some are appointed which all depends on the state. Appointed officials are usually more reasonable and elected are not because higher rates = mad voters = re-election chances lower.
For a long time, insurers have struggled to get sufficient rate changes approved. A literal quote for you during Covid was, “Son, I’m looking out my window at downtown {city} and I don’t see many cars on the road. We won’t approve the rate increases.”
This was with actual data of losses increasing due to supply chain disruption of auto parts, labor increases and many more things.
We basically had to write policies and hope for the best despite knowing the data / trend lines forecasting major losses.
Fast-forward and what do you have - major losses by all of these companies - and so these companies have two choices: 
- Try to get rate approvals 
- Exit the market or line of insurance
For California, the latter is the better option because at least for auto you cannot use credit, telematics or other very predictive attributes to price the risk. This results in essentially pooled risk which in aggregate drives up rates for all. Simply put, California officials did this to themselves.
For other states, the first option works but the rate increases are now significantly higher because it was near impossible to get any adequate rate increases last few years.
So, the bill has come due and it sucks for everyone as it’s either a) higher prices or b) can’t get insurance (Florida folks for certain types) or c) limited suppliers not being able to get reinsurance to share the risk results in higher rates that customers can’t afford so they go without.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once spent six months working the hardest I've ever worked in my entire life with a mechanical engineer, two technicians, a machinist, and all of the supporting cast of procurement and scheduling to build a test fixture for a control board for a satellite.
There were four control boards per panel and four panels per satellite and a projected order of 12 satellites so were going to have over 200 boards (enough plus spares) to test and last go-around it took two days to test a single board with failures due to connector issues and I wanted to get that down to two boards per day and no failures.
It was my masterpiece. Place a board on the fixture, pull down an assembly, and six micro-D, two nano-D, MCU and FPGA programming connections, remote thermal and multimeter probes, and a canbus connection with onboard amplifier to traverse the absurdly long cable all slotted with perfect precision into the board and were routed back to a test rack via a single cable bundle. Automated test bench scripts powered on the board, took voltage measurements, programmed the devices, and ran a suite of tests automatically and then printed out a report with a signature block for me to sign at the end.
The board experienced no stress, every connector was mated with perfect force at the perfect angles, and it would cut down the amount of time needed to test the hundreds of boards we were going to build by months.
It was featured in marketing materials for my employer.
We built four of them and with all of the labor they probably cost a quarter million each but would put the program back on track as it was delayed.
Additional delays in another part of the program led to the government cancelling the entire thing and we turned over all of our tooling and prototypes to the customer who probably put my fixtures in a warehouse for fifteen years before selling them for scrap value.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly 15 years ago I worked for a large media company that was thinking about moving into the smart energy meter business.
I was late to join the team, but when I did, they'd already bought and branded thousands of meters that were boxed and ready to go in a nearby warehouse. The team had already built a number of APIs exposing controls for these meters as well as various monitoring and reporting interfaces. A UI already existed but it had issues, my job was to come in and fix that and get us ready for release.
We worked hard for a couple of months and whipped this thing into shape. Meanwhile a multi million budget was lined up for the marketing launch. Adverts where drafted, installation technicians where trained and merchandising was branded. All systems go.
It all drove towards a set in stone deadline and we busted our guts to get there... When the day arrived, there we sat. Ready. All features built, no bugs that we knew of. Ready to hit the 'go live' button. Honestly in 30 years working in the industry, that was the only time I think I've ever been in that situation.
Our product owner walks into the room and says, "erm, there's a couple of issues we need to discuss at board level. Hold tight guys I'll be back".
So we sit...
Two days later he returns, "erm, guys... the board aren't sure that this product is on brand. And they are concerned that if it fails it could be bad for reputation. So, we're not launching."
So we sat... for a month... working down our contracts whilst I taught myself Node.js]]></summary>

After acquisition - we were handed down the order to migrate to AWS.
This was after (in the mess of the merger) the colo contracts were basically ignored and not renewed. Once someone within the company realized the issue, it was the 11th hour.
After many, many attempts to discuss our (Operations team) concerns, we abandoned our protests. It was clear the new CTO wouldn't cave and sign the contract.
Some superficial testing was conducted and the order came down to move...NOW.
We began moving hundreds (maybe thousands) of very resource hungry DB servers first (there was no way to use something like RDS without major app/config changes).
Once the AWS bill came in, the CFO blew their lid and within 90 days we were migrating BACK to our DCs (and the millions of dollars of hardware we left idling).]]></summary>

What they asked for: Refreshing their suit of unit tests, 10,000 of them, that had gone stale (that applied to their widely used C++ telephony library)
Budget NZ$1,000,000
(Don't ask what, why, really?)
I joined half way through
Half the budget spent, nothing to show, mission mysteriously changed to producing a deep packet inspection tool. (What happened to the unit tests you ask? Be quiet! Take the money)
My job was to reach deep into their system and bring the data to the surface, roughly speaking
Thing is nobody that worked on the library wanted, needed, or asked for any aspect of what were doing
The design for it was written on a whiteboard by the project lead before I joined
Then the whiteboard was cleaned.
So the design was in one man's head
That man, the project lead, quit 3 weeks before delivery
On handover day  I was a bit afraid, I had taken care to keep good records of my obeying (increasingly unhinged) instructions,  so I was confident I could not be blamed (I was younger and naive-not part of the story)
But I fully expected an unpleasant "you did what with our money? What were you thinking?" type of unpleasant meeting
Instead the corporate types sat around a table gushing how wonderful everything was, what a brilliant job we'd all done...
I was stunned.  I understand now, I learnt that day, that it was in no-one's interest to acknowledge the waste of a million bucks
Coming from academia, as I was more or less, this was a valuable lesson.
But utterly worthless software for a million dollars
I still use some of the furniture I bought with the money....]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once worked on an in-house ERP system which had been developed over about 15 years by various developers. It was the engine of the entire company, everything passed through it. The CFO and some senior leadership erroneously blamed it for their shortcomings/used it as a scapegoat. When new management took charge, an initiative was started to replace the system with an industry standard solution. Both myself and the CTO (my boss) made it clear that we strongly felt this would not only go way over budget, but ultimately fail as a project.
Having no understanding as to the technicalities involved, the project was given the go ahead by the directors after several meetings with a vendor. After the CTO and I expressed our concerns about the scale of the project and the sheer amount of functionality involved, the vendor gleefully assured us that they were experienced with "migrations of this scale" and were more than prepared, which was music to the ears of the CFO.
Daily 2-3 hour meetings followed (for many months) to define the scope of the project. Within each meeting I sort of zoned out because it became very obvious that no only did the vendor not understand the scale of the work involved, but had started cutting corners everywhere/leaving out crucial functionality, and this was just the scoping stage, no development had even started yet.
I eventually departed the company but kept in contact with the CTO and learned that after 5 years (project was scoped for 2), the migration was abandoned costing multiple millions of dollars with nothing to show for it.]]></summary>

I was there around 97 (?) and remember everyone in the company being asked to read the book "The Innovator's Dilemma", which described exactly this situation - a high end company being overtaken by worse but cheaper competitors that improved year by year until they take the entire market. The point being that the company was extremely aware of what was happening. It was not taken by surprise. But in spite of that, it was still unable to respond.]]></summary>

At Ænix, we have a deep affection for Kubernetes and dream that all modern technologies will soon
start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.

To the extent that Havana Syndrome is projection, one has to wonder what our spooks have been up to – have THEY been testing sonic beams or microwaves that induce nausea in the floridly paranoid?

Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.]]></summary>

Since Windows support graduated to stable
with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summary: parking places are a woefully inefficient use of space. And ugly. Cars are a woefully inefficient use of machinery. Using them, in combination with bi-directional charging of cars, to produce solar can amend this. Doing this the right way, parking places can be beautified, costs will go down and life will be more pleasant. […]]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>
