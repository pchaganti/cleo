There is this undercurrent to our technology landscape. A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost.  I can only describe it as a live exploration of concepts _through_ technology, where functional fixedness is a foreign concept, including in the shared experience of social construct; everything becomes parts to be remixed in a way.  In this place people just do things that, by way of having fun, just becomes art.  It's emergent gameplay just by following a solitary "rule of cool."
I saw this page and was immediately transported back to the late 1990's and early 'aughts.  The kind of "I glued these things together and just look" attitude that graced the pages of hackaday.com and slashdot.org.  LED "throwies" come to mind.
In this case we have a de-facto art installation.  I imagine that this was probably put together with odds and ends, maybe installed illegally, and probably doesn't have longevity in mind for its construction. It lightheartedly challenges some conventions, challenges ideas about privacy, brushes up against copyright, and is entertaining to boot. Most importantly, how it was made is less interesting than what it _does_, and where it carries the conversation of the observer.  Or maybe: that's the point.]]></summary>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus. Also known as, at this time, the Women's Royal Air Force. Where she became an air traffic controller, as it is also known, air is notoriously difficult to control at any given time of the day or night.]]></summary>

But how well do central banks understand the expectations of market participants—and vice versa? Our model, developed in a recent paper, features a dynamic game between (i) a monetary authority that cannot commit to an inflation target and (ii) a set of market participants that understand the incentives created by that credibility problem. In this post, we describe the game, a type of Keynesian beauty contest: its main novelty is that each side attempts, with varying degrees of accuracy, to forecast the other’s beliefs, resulting in new findings regarding the levels and trajectories of inflation.]]></summary>

They sprayed with water guns the blithe holidaymakers seated in restaurants.  Video footage showed unhappy couples and glowering young men chased from their seats by the mob, stunned at the indignity.
The protesters shouted “tourists go home.” They held signs that said “Barcelona is not for sale.” They spoke of “mass touristification” and inveighed against the greed of restaurateurs and hoteliers and Airbnb landlords profiting from the madding crowd while the average Catalan struggled to meet the skyrocketing costs of daily life. One of the protesters told an interviewer, “The city has turned completely for tourists. What we want is a city for citizens.” More

Most books published today have the affect of a book, but the author doesn't really have anything to say. Publishing a book is not about communicating ideas, but a means to something else. It's not meant to stand on its own.

Its supporters were the also-rans like Musk [1] trying to empty out the bottom of the pack, as well as those who are against any AI they cannot control, such as antagonists of the West and wary copyright holders.

a classic. delicious Y2K Teal. iconic. gotta love her. 4.5/5.
blueberry

barely distinguishable from the original Bondi Blue, but from what i can tell in photos online and in real life, it's a slightly lighter color compared to bondi blue. but because of that, i think it's missing some contrast. i don't like it as much. 3/5
grape

underappreciated one! this color combination makes me think of the Teenz Zone at my library circa 2000. 4/5
tangerine

truthfully, my fondness for this one is 99% because of The Cheat's computer. but it's a fun, retrofuturistic color choice, especially with the form factor. on its own i give it a 4.5/5, but it gets elevated to 5/5 because it makes me think of Homestar.

The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That's the core of Nihil's philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1967, in the course of the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, the Israeli military razed three Palestinian villages which stood along a corridor connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In keeping with longstanding practice, the Israeli government turned the land over to the Jewish National Fund, which sought to permanently displace the Palestinian villagers through “afforestation,” or redevelopment of the area as a public park, where the former residents would be considered squatters if they tried to return to their homes. To fund the displacement-as-conservation, JNF solicited the Jewish community in Canada, whose contributions also lent the park its name: Canada Park.
Now, more than half a century later, as the Israeli occupation of the West Bank persists amid its ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, JNF’s activities have come under new scrutiny. Most significantly, the Jewish National Fund of Canada has lost its charitable status due to even more outright support for Israeli violence: financing projects for the Israeli military in violation of regulations prohibiting charities from supporting foreign armed forces and activities contrary to public policy, such as illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[America and its origin story are full of unexamined assumptions, one of the biggest being that voters actually cast their ballots for presidential candidates. Is democracy – which comes from the Greek words for people (demos) and rule (kratos) – the USA’s foundational “Big Lie”? Consider that, according to Ari Berman’s new book Minority Rule, only 1.8% of the population of the 13 original states voted in George Washington’s 1789 presidential election. In One Person, One Vote? director Maximina Juson goes behind the closed doors of 1787’s Constitutional Convention, when America’s anti-democratic original sin was enshrined in the new nation’s framed rules, and – like Howard Zinn’s People’s History and Oliver Stone’s Untold History of the United States – reveals hidden truths about “the land of the free.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recognize the author Jascha as an incredibly brilliant ML researcher, formerly at Google  Brain and now at Anthropic.
Among his notable accomplishments, he and coauthors mathematically characterized the propagation of signals through deep neural networks via techniques from physics and statistics (mean field and free probability theory). Leading to arguably some of the most profound yet under-appreciated theoretical and experimental results in ML in the past decade. For example see “dynamical isometry” [1] and the evolution of those ideas which were instrumental in achieving convergence in very deep transformer models [2].
After reading this post and the examples given, in my eyes there is no question that this guy has an extraordinary intuition for optimization, spanning beyond the boundaries of ML and across the fabric of modern society.
We ought to recognize his technical background and raise this discussion above quibbles about semantics and definitions.
Let’s address the heart of his message, the very human and empathetic call to action that stands in the shadow of rapid technological progress:
> If you are a scientist looking for research ideas which are pro-social, and have the potential to create a whole new field, you should consider building formal (mathematical) bridges between results on overfitting in machine learning, and problems in economics, political science, management science, operations research, and elsewhere.

"Oh, that's [deadname]," said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.
Eh? That's me?
I'll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my "I have to be a man" phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It's very easy to read it that way because Waymond's character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead.

Do you sometimes hear that? I think it's such an incredibly stupid thing to say. If you were me, which you clearly aren't, then you would do something that I, as myself, wouldn’t do.
It's just a way of expressing oneself, someone might think. I beg to differ.
My feeling is that the person who expresses themselves in that way has a lot of their own issues that should be addressed. Instead of doing that, they get a momentary, false sense of "I got my shit together" by explaining what others should do.
Do you want to share your own experiences? Please do, I love listening to that. Do you have specific advice to give? Bring it on, and I'll take what applies to who I am here and now.
Do you want to explain what's best for me right now? Keep it to yourself, please, and sort out your own shit first. Good luck!

This is a project I've started many times before without a lot of success on several different WordPress sites—all of which no longer exist. The first was a free blog I set up when I first came to Japan in 2015 as a student. I'd seen so many blogs by other exchange students and thought it'd be pretty exciting. The only problem was that I didn't think that anything I was doing was very exciting, so I quickly stopped doing it. I've tried since to make several paid sites that focus on my reading and writing book reviews. There were a lot of problems with that, most of which came down to the fact that I was extremely worried about making the "perfect" site even though it was just something that I wanted to do for fun. WordPress has always just also been r…]]></summary>

This long-form essay was sent to us for publication by “some communist study group“. It discusses the historical role of Ukraine in the contemporary political economy, the response from radicals in the West towards the Russian invasion, and the material effects on the global political economy emanating from the disruption of a major bread basket, specifically with an eye towards revolt. The questions raised here are important not just for the current moment, but also for any social movement that desires to truly engage with “present state of t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's from my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic when they can actually see you hurting. For the millionth time in my life, I wished depression manifested like the flu or some other recognizable disease, just to make it simple for me and for the people around me.
How much easier would it be if mental illness were physical - visible and tangible? A runny nose and a sore throat - people would understand. They would offer me tissues, a warm cup of tea, and a sympathetic get well soon. But a shitty compilation of mental symptoms and an even shittier chemical make up? How do I explain an intangible pain?
What can I say, anyway? Sometimes I feel like I am carrying around a heavy suitcase full of sadness everywhere that I go. The smallest task feels impossible. Everything is dull yet heavy, all at once.  Everything matters too much yet nothing matters. Anything would be easier to explain than what's really going on.
I think this topic further resonates with me as someone with high-functioning depression. I recall an attempt to open up about my state with a close friend, who reacted with amusement and disbelief, as if I was exchanging lighthearted banter. But you are so put together, Tala. You are successful, ace tests, and excel at work - it must be a misdiagnosis.
I was overwhelmed with shame that later transformed into rage. I found it impossible to articulate the depth of pain - that yes, I am waking up everyday, leaving bed, fulfilling my obligations. But I am still struggling, still fighting a relentless battle with the energy I have left.
And there are millions of us suffering a silent, invisible battle against our mental illnesses, while we present a facade of normalcy to world. Because sometimes silence is the easier option.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These sorts of articles raise so many thoughts and emotions in me.  I was trained as a computational biologist with a little lab work and ran gels from time to time.  Personally, I hated gels- they're finicky, messy, ugly, and don't really tell you very much.  But molecular biology as a field runs on gels- it's the priimary source of results for almost everything in molbio.  I have seen more talks and papers that rested entirely a single image of a gel which is really just some dark bands.
At the same time, I was a failed scientist: my gels weren't as interesting, or convincing compared to the ones done by the folks who went on to be more successful.  At the time (20+ years ago) it didn't occur to me that anybody would intentionally modify images of gels to promote the results they claimed, although I did assume that folks didn't do a good job of organizing their data, and occasionally published papers that were wrong simply because they confused two images.
Would I have been more successful if fewer people (and I now believe this is a common occurrence) published fraudulent images of gels?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the more important thing is that everybody just went along with this.  I participated in many journal clubs where folks would just flip to Figure 3, assume the gel was what the authors claimed, and proceed to agree with (or disagree with) the results and conclusions uncritically.  Whereas I would spend a lot of time trying to understand what experiment was actually run, and what th e data showed.]]></summary>

I also feel that through my life I've (maybe wrongly) placed a great deal of respect and trust in scientists, mostly that they understand that their work is of the upmost importance and so the downstream consequences of mucking around are just too grave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am always glad to see people pursuing creating their own programming language. More people should give it a try, IMHO.
A tricky thing that comes up with Rust comparisons is that often, Rust has a feature that's weird or hard to use, but it's because that's the only solution that makes sense within the constraints Rust has placed upon itself. Clicking some links gets me to https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/src/branch/master/docs/yao/de...
> Yao's biggest goals are: Correctness, Convenience, Performance, in that order.
Having clear goals is a great thing when making a language, because they give you guidance on what is appropriate to include and what is not.
Rust has certainly demonstrated having similar goals, but in a slightly different order: Correctness, Performance, and then Convenience. So it wouldn't shock me if Yao could do some things better than Rust, in accordance with its goals. But that also means that sometimes, Rust would be useful where Yao cannot be. Everything is tradeoffs.
Incidentally, I actually think that figuring out what your values are, and what your needs are, is a great way to pick a programming language. Decide what matters to you as an engineer, and then find a language that shares similar values. I gave a conference talk a few years back on this idea, and how I viewed Rust's values at the time https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-tradeoffs/
This was based off of bcantrill's Platform as a Reflection of Values, which was very influential on me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhx970_JKX4
If you've ever heard about Oxide's focus on values, this is some of the older background on that.]]></summary>

Their favorite family trip so far?  When we traveled to Arkansas to mine for crystals.  AKA, dig in the dirt all day.  They saw it on a YouTube video. They asked to go.  So we obliged. I had never been to Arkansas.  It's beautiful.
We stayed at a resort, Diamonds Old West Cabins, with a huge playground outside the cabins, archery, and a bubble party every evening at 6 pm.

This is a bit crass of course; that page is for things I generally don’t want to do and isn’t meant for explanation, exceptions and nuance. Of course there are services I subscribe to - I currently pay for Proton, Spotify and Apple Fitness.
One reason is, of course, that these services don’t offer lifetime payment. But in their cases, I understand how that’s not feasible - their services are heavily dependent on serving content via cloud and development of new content and improved features. The bandwidth needs to be paid for, artists, devs and fitness trainers need to be paid constantly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most depressing thing for me is the feeling that I simply cannot trust anything that has been written in the past 2 years or so and up until the day that I die. It's not so much that I think people have used AI, but that I know they have with a high degree of certainty, and this certainty is converging to 100%, simply because there is no way it will not. If you write regularly and you're not using AI, you simply cannot keep up with the competition. You're out. And the growing consensus is "why shouldn't you?", there is no escape from that.
Now, I'm not going to criticize anyone that does it, like I said, you have to, that's it. But what I had never noticed until now is that knowing that a human being was behind the written words (however flawed they can be, and hopefully are) is crucial for me. This has completely destroyed my interest in reading any new things. I guess I'm lucky that we have produced so much writing in the past century or so and I'll never run out of stuff to read, but it's still depressing, to be honest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports gambling has been legal in the UK since 1960. Gambling wasn't seriously problematic in this country until 2005, when regulations were substantially liberalised. Pre-2005, sports betting was something that old men did in dingy backstreet shops; post-2005, it became a widespread social phenomenon, turbocharged by advertising and the growing influence and accessibility of the internet.
There's a false dichotomy between prohibition and laissez-faire, which the US seems particularly prone to. You've seen similar issues with the decriminalisation of cannabis, where many states seem to have switched abruptly from criminalisation to a fully-fledged commercial market. There is a broad spectrum of other options in between those points that tend to be under-discussed.
You can ban gambling advertising, as Italy did in 2019. You can set limits on maximum stakes or impose regulations to make gambling products less attractive to new customers and less risky for problem gamblers. You can have a single state-controlled parimutuel operator. Gambling does cause harm - whether it's legal or not - but it is within the purview of legislators to create a gambling market in which harm reduction is the main priority.]]></summary>

The new Israeli strikes which started on September 17 with the exploding pagers have resulted so far in more than 5000 killed and injured Lebanese.
For the past 11 months, the Lebanese Resistance limited its attacks exclusively to Israeli military bases, in or near, the "Jewish-only" colonies along the Lebanese border. The current Israeli assault was likely planned to take place on September 16 ahead of the aexplosion of the pagers, but had to be postponed due to an unforeseen clash with the visit of Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein. Consequently, Israel may have failed, either due to confusion or technical difficulties, to reprogram the pagers’ activation to another date. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports gambling, like all gambling, ruins lives. It's certainly worth having the discussion about whether people should be able to run a train through their life and the lives of their families via app.
But a much easier argument against sports betting is that it ruins the sports. Players throw. They get good at subtly cheating. The gambling apparatus latches itself to the sport, to the teams and players, the umpires and judges, the sporting organizations. With this much money on the line, it's not a matter of if but when games are thrown, cheated -- the bigger the game, the bigger the incentive. It's even easier now because of the amount of side/parlay betting that is available. It exhausts the spirit of competition.
Sports gambling is diametrically opposed to sport itself.]]></summary>

However, building a successful SaaS platform demands on meticulous architectural planning, especially given the inherent challenges of multi-tenancy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This won't have nearly the same impact, but when you're considering how vulnerabilities like this might influence your future purchasing decisions, remember that Kia's decision to omit interlocks from their US vehicles (but not Canadian ones!) led to a nationwide epidemic of Kia thefts so large it fed a crime wave, something a number of US cities are suing Kia over. If you've read about carjacking waves in places like Milwaukee and Chicago: that was largely driven by a decision Kia made, which resulted in the nationwide deployment of a giant fleet of "burner" cars that could be stolen with nothing but a bent USB cable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem I have with this is simple and has to do with the lack of separation of entities.
Automattic is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.com is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation IS NOT a competitor with WPEngine.
There is a dispute between Automattic and WPEngine. The resources of Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation should not be leverage in this dispute.
The fact that those boundaries are crossed means that anyone who is in competition with Automattic might have any and all ecosystems that Matt has any control over leveraged against them if they upset Matt or Automattic in any way.
It is very poor taste and changes the perspective of the product. Instead of a professional entity who will engage professionally it is now a form of leverage that a single person could wield against anyone who crosses them.
To be clear these same exact actions can be taken against anyone who insults one individual. This look is embarrassing.]]></summary>

 Jean-Baptiste Vidalou, “We Are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle” (Cambridge: Polity, 2023) 
 It’s shameful. The original French publication of We are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle by Jean-Baptiste Vidalou was in my hands since April 2018. Frequently described as “the French Seeing Like a State,” the book explores the art of state making in France. Having been in stimulating dialogues with Jean-Baptiste Vidalou (JBV) since 2018, and being linguistically challenged, I knew the general ideas and points in the book—…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.]]></summary>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary dream…]]></summary>

DJ: What is Anarchism? 
JZ: I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination. This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…]]></summary>

How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn't really my choice; the doctor said that they could "try to do some creative billing," but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i'm away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i'm living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i've met so many wonderful friends. i've lost a few. i've bought a car. i've gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i've had more than a few mental health episodes... i've also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i've learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what'll happen in the next five!]]></summary>
