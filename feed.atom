But you can call me Jedda.
🚧 This page is a work in progress, but I too, am always a work in progress, so I think it all works out.
Based in the Bay Area (CA), but originally from the East Coast. I’m a Product Manager by profession, photography hobbyist, avid reader, and a creative by nature. I have a 12-year old dachshund named Cocoa (Chanel), who pretty much runs my life.
I’m not great at writing (or talking) about myself. If you stick around, little bits and pieces of my life do surface itself in the things I create and write.
This blog doesn’t have a specific theme. It’s mostly anything and everything that pops into my head. It was initially started as a place for quick notes, that turned into long form thoughts, but now is just an overall place for my primarily text-based everything.
I’d love to hear from you, even if it’s just to say hello. I’m typically available on socials such as 🐘Mastodon but can easily be reached via email through my Letterbird (or the email embedded in my posts). If you’d like to subscribe via RSS, you can do so 📡 here.
Welcome to my Notes. I am so glad you're here.]]></summary>

Preface (2004)
 This document was originally drafted by members of the Anarchist Workers’ Association, (A.W.A.) following a resolution passed at the 1976 [?] A.W.A. conference, which called for the A.W.A. to agree a clearer definition of its theory and strategy. At that time the A.W.A. had groups and members in England and Scotland, and a sympathiser or two in Ireland, and published the monthly newspaper ‘Anarchist Worker’. The text below was adopted as a ‘provisional’ rather than as a definitive text by the tendency whose members went on to publish ‘Libertarian Communist’, and renamed t…]]></summary>

But I do seem to have time for browsing what others write while I wait on the mundane waits in life, which normally translates to waiting in a line, waiting in a waiting room (probably the most obviously named room in the english language)  or waiting for the dog to stop sniffing around and pee.
In these little moments, the phone comes out and I look at the recent posts. I’m fascinated by what you write. The honesty, the freeform, the choice of blog styles, the navigation tabs (I’m really happy with the “nope” and will be adding one soon), all of it.
I’m just really glad to be here. And I want to thank you all for your contributions. You make my world brighter.
And for those of you that think “no one will see this”. You are wrong. Someone will.

I took up to Calc AB in high school, and I only knew basic web development coming into CMU. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University this semester.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i'm boon.
appreciate you for being here.
i've always wanted to be an astronaut but i found myself making bits fly instead. i love that which is aesthetic and i take great pride in designing beautiful distributed systems. i enjoy dota, strawberries, and software (in that order).
i like to think reasonably, objectively, creatively, simply, and always with the future in mind. i'm very strongly opinionated, but i love nothing more than being corrected correctly. i love learning experiences.
the majority of my posts will probably be irrelevant to you, especially since i enjoy yapping, but peruse at your leisure.
always happy to chat on twitter.
see you sometime,
boon]]></summary>

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: https://httptoolkit.com/blog/public-cdn-risks/
You can reduce issues like this using subresource intergrity (SRI) but there are still tradeoffs (around privacy & reliability - see article above) and there is a better solution: self-host your dependencies behind a CDN service you control (just bunny/cloudflare/akamai/whatever is fine and cheap).
In a tiny prototyping project, a public CDN is convenient to get started fast, sure, but if you're deploying major websites I would really strong recommend not using public CDNs, never ever ever ever (the World Economic Forum website is affected here, for example! Absolutely ridiculous).]]></summary>

If security means every maintainer of every OSS package you use has to be scrupulous, tireless, and not screw up for life, not sure what to say when this kind of thing happens other than "isn't that the only possible outcome given the system and incentives on a long enough timeline?"
Kind of like the "why is my favorite company monetizing now and using dark patterns?"  Well, on an infinite timeline did you think service would remain high quality, free, well supported, and run by tireless, unselfish, unambitious benevolent dictators for the rest of your life?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Impressions from last week’s CVPR, a conference with 12k attendees on computer vision - Pretty much everyone is using NVIDIA GPUs, and pretty much everyone isn’t happy with the prices, and would like some competition in the space:
NVIDIA was there with 57 papers, a website dedicated to their research presented at the conference, a full day tutorial on accelerating deep learning, and ever present with shirts and backpacks in the corridors and at poster presentations.
AMD had a booth at the expo part, where they were raffling off some GPUs. I went up to them to ask what framework I should look into, when writing kernels (ideally from Python) for GPGPU. They referred me to the “technical guy”, who it turns out had a demo on inference on an LLM. Which he couldn’t show me, as the laptop with the APU had crashed and wouldn’t reboot. He didn’t know about writing kernels, but told me there was a compiler guy who might be able to help, but he wasn’t to be found at that moment, and I couldn’t find him when returning to the booth later.
I’m not at all happy with this situation. As long as AMDs investment into software and evangelism remains at ~$0, I don’t see how any hardware they put out will make a difference. And you’ll continue to hear people walking away from their booth, saying “oh when I win it I’m going to sell it to buy myself an NVIDIA GPU”.]]></summary>

I was inspired to create this one after watching the trailer for the upcoming 2024 remake. The theme has an atmospheric aesthetic that evokes the haunting tone of the original movie. I've designed this theme to be ideal for blogs focused on horror, Gothic literature, or film reviews. The font treatment is also ideal for long-form book reviews or essays. I hope you enjoy exploring the CSS and customizing it to your liking. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear rats scratching in the walls...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I launched the July Reply blog challenge. I like the idea and hoped there would be a lot of interest, but so far, it's been lukewarm.
For the past few weeks, I have posted something new every day. Many of the texts that I've been proud of have barely gotten any attention at all.
“Why am I even doing this for?”
I heard myself thinking that today. It's so incredibly stupid and ridiculous that it's embarrassing to even mention it.
I'm doing this because I love it. If others like it too, great, but that's not the main purpose.
No one likes everything we do, whether we're a small blogger or the biggest artist in the world. On the other hand, we will always think that our latest creations are our best. Why else would we continue?
We are all different—equally different.
You're sitting on the world's best joke, looking forward to the laughter, but you're met with the reaction: “Is that all?”
Different.
You tell someone about the greatest movie ever made and then ask what they thought: “It wasn't to my taste, so I turned it off after half an hour."
Different.
You like watching football. I hate sports.
Different.
What a wonderful diversity!]]></summary>

It really wasn’t that intrusive and eventually the company folded and I got a free (shitty) ad-free pc out of it.
I’m a Mac user now but when I pull up windows 11 on my kid’s or wife’s laptop, it feels like that free-pc dot com again, only it’s in every person’s PC. I’m genuinely shocked at the amount of trash that barrages a common user in windows, and shocked that Microsoft gets away with it.
My 14 year old gets barraged with not just co-pilot but a bunch of news and trash clickbait that is straight inappropriate for kids to see.
I’ve had to remove it all twice but with every significant update, somehow my settings get reversed and we’re back at square one.
I tried even using local accounts but it causes significant issues in the OS.
If you’d told me in 1999 that free-pc.com was the dystopian digital future we’d all be living in, I’d have laughed you out of the room - but that’s exactly what we have. The only difference is that the PC isn’t free. We are.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JULIAN ASSANGE IS FREE
Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stanstead airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.
This is the result of a  global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom  campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum,  all the way to the United Nations. This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible.
After more than five years in a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars.
WikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles,and for the people's right to know.
As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom.
Julian's freedom is our freedom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm the person driving this.
NTP is worth moving to a memory safe language but of course it's not the single most critical thing in our entire stack to make memory safe. I don't think anyone is claiming that. It's simply the first component that got to production status, a good place to start.
NTP is a component worth moving to a memory safe language because it's a widely used critical service on a network boundary. A quick Google for NTP vulnerabilities will show you that there are plenty of memory safety vulnerabilities lurking in C NTP implementations:
https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2153...
Some of these are severe, some aren't. It's only a matter of time though until another severe one pops up.
I don't think any critical service on a network boundary should be written in C/C++, we know too much at this point to think that's a good idea. It will take a while to change that across the board though.
If I had to pick the most important thing in the context of Let's Encrypt to move to a memory safe language it would be DNS. We have been investing heavily in Hickory DNS but it's not ready for production at Let's Encrypt yet (our usage of DNS is a bit more complex than the average use case).
https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns
Work is proceeding at a rapid pace and I expect Hickory DNS to be deployed at Let's Encrypt in 2025.]]></summary>

I was wondering why my internet speeds were slow when I discovered that Microsoft was in the process of uploading my users directory, they had already uploaded almost two gigs when I realized. They also changed the path to these directories to something like C:\Users\name\OneDrive\Desktop\. Another poster in this thread claimed it's easy to reverse -- I disagree, it's a pain in the ass to track down the setting, and I shouldn't have to do this. When I did, it gave me an error for one of the directories and refuses to revert (documents?).
I don't like leaving negative or hyperbolic comments on HN, but this was enraging and unacceptable to me. It's hard to convey without coming off as unhinged.

Following its peak at 6.6 percent in September 2022, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down rapidly over the last two years, falling to 3.6 percent recently. What explains the rapid shifts in U.S. inflation dynamics? In a recent paper, we show that the interaction between supply chain pressures and labor market tightness amplified the inflation surge in 2021. In this post, we argue that these same forces that drove the nonlinear rise in inflation have worked in reverse since late 2022, accelerating the disinflationary process.

If Apple feels these rules are so just and fair and indispuitably correct, why does it go to such measures to hide them from its consumers?
Consistently these anti-steering rules are what gets Apple in trouble all around the world. It's the one part Apple lost in the US Epic case, and it's the EUs first point on their breach.

It’s a strange feeling knowing that stupidity is inevitable. It’s also a very powerful one. Accepting this fact is the first step to eventually changing it. In the past, I would have much preferred LARPing as someone that knew what they were talking about instead of just admitting to how dumb I really was. That was pretty dumb too.
I wonder what some of the great technologists today feel dumb about. What do John Carmack and Andrej Karpathy wish they understood sooner? How many months and years of feeling dumb will it take me to get to how dumb they are today?

The thing is, the way I tend to remember people is by how they made me feel. Few people in my life have made me feel like a real, raw person when talking to them. But some have. Some of these people are miles away, and have maybe always been miles away, both geographically and otherwise.
It's a really painful thing, because as these memories I hold go further and further back in my memory, I don't know what I want anymore. All I really want is to feel the way they made me feel again. Not so easy though, is it?
We've both grown in separate ways, and I'm grateful for where I am in my life, I think I've done pretty alright for myself so far. No matter what I do though, it does feel like there's a certain hole in my life, somewhere I'm lacking greatly. The remedy is so far though. Maybe it doesn't even exist, not anymore.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not a fan of having dark mode on my site because I have a hard time choosing colors that speak to me. I like to keep things minimalistic with my colors, and for me, it’s just much easier to do with a white background. However, I know (and acknowledge) the importance of having one, and so I pushed myself to do some tinkering on the blog this morning. Besides, my eyeballs also hate me when I look at my site at night, and so I’m sure it’s the case for other people too.
I subscribe to a lot of blogs via RSS reader, but I do take the extra step to launch their site to read the post. I have a deep appreciation for those who take the time to design their site the way they want, and so I want to read their posts the way it was meant to be read. It’s kind of like: listening to an album in order because I know that the artist ordered it a specific way for people to listen to. At the same time, it’s OK if you want to shuffle the playlist if you as the consumer want to, just like it’s OK for those who read my posts to do so via an RSS feed.
Anyways, this is just a quick post to say that, if your preference is dark mode, it is now available on here. I’ll revisit my site again at night time to test out the color contrasts (since I worked on this during daytime) to see if it makes sense, or if my eyeballs are still straining to read things.
Due to this, I’ve also gone ahead and created a Changelog for my site, so I can keep track of the little (and big) changes I make on here.
Side note:
I typically do have my screens on dark mode, and so if the sites/blog I read have dark mode, I read those in dark mode. It’s a weird thing for me to want my site in a lighter background, but I do struggle with it sometimes. Thanks to those who have put up with probably burning your retinas reading my posts if you weren’t doing so in an RSS reader. I appreciate you.

I have been subbed to Claude Opus for a few months (yes, I am an earlier believer than you people). Couple of days back, I was working on a project and opened Anthropic chat. Then I realised it was showing "Sonnet 3.5 - Our most intelligent model" and it was seriously a major surprise.
I have been playing with with it for a couple of days now. Wrote some code ranging from Python, HTML, CSS, JSS to Pytorch and Jax. Made it do some editing and proof-reading. So far it's been smooth sailing. Maybe we haven't hit a wall yet (Ok I am not important enough to comment on this but you gotta remember it's my blog).

Source: Retrieved on 2024-06-21 from https://files.libcom.org/files/freedom-centenary.pdf

 There is no such thing as human society. 
 A lot of muddled thinking rests on the error that because ‘society’ is a useful noun, it must refer to a thing. It is one of those nouns like ‘journey’ and ‘tennis’, which refers not to a thing but to a relationship between things. The statement ‘human society exists’ is simply a less cumbersome way of saying ‘human individuals relate to each other in certain complicated ways’. The question, ‘what is the purpose of human society?’ means the same as, ‘why do human individuals associate in the way they do?’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - author here.
This is a big question tbh and the lack of a succession plan is a function of many things:
1. This was my dad's baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one's mortality which I also believe was difficult for him.
2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering/science of the company made us a non-starter.
3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession/exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly.
There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I've thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those "play the cards you're dealt" kind of situations.
Thanks for reading.]]></summary>

But since I might talk non-stop, I decided to go with a letter (yeah, I'm old school that way—don't judge me). I woke up and did my morning routine (yes, I do have a routine).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, new corner of the internet I've just found!
I found this place in the most fun way, I found a zine that was (I can only assume) planted in the library I work at by
veronique.ink! I thought it was the coolest thing I've ever seen, the coolest idea. Initially I didn't realize it was a website link that was written on the page, but an instagram handle, so I was struggling to find them for only a second before I found the sense to type it into google.
I recently lost my notebook, or at least can't find it in the mess of my room. Usually I write my random thoughts in there, as I figured I had become above the notes app and was looking for reasons to stay off my phone. Of course, as soon as I lose my means of documenting my ideas, all sorts of events pass me by with nowhere to write about them. I've only just finished high school, recently lost my grandmother, and all sorts of change is crashing my way, and now I need to just stew in it..? Or worse, take to my notes app??
Then lo and behold, there's the zine just sitting on the shelf. Scrolling through these websites here, I figured maybe it was a sign. Or I'm just bored and want a new hobby. Only God knows. So anyway, I'm hoping I'll still find my notebook once I get around to cleaning my room. Maybe then I can even publish those thoughts in there! For now I'll just write them straight from screen to the world.]]></summary>

Title: The left of capital is sabotaging the anarchist movement: let’s fight back!
Date: June 2024

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I don't know... Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I've already failed?), seriously.
I'm a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I'm failing more.
I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I coul…]]></summary>
