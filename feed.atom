ABSTRACT
 Systems theory can show us how organizations develop, allowing them to survive changes in their environments. Such analyses also demonstrate why the CNT is passing through such a profound crisis: it is a trade union which is completely excluded from the world of work. The CNT began in a society very different from today. Despite the many significant changes which have occurred since 1910, its organizational structures and ideological assumptions have remained practically unchanged.

 We have allowed the American ruling class[1]to abstract themselves almost entirely from their substantive political positions and practices. So deeply engrossed are we in their branding as products of consumption, in their spectacular representations, that we seem to have no capacity to grapple critically with the situation we find ourselves in. The moment calls for careful reengagement with French philosopher Guy Debord’s book The Society of the Spectacle, as well as one of its most important, if unsung, precursors, German philosopher (perhaps anti-philosopher) …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m finding myself falling into this habit of reading blog posts that resonate with me, with full intention of writing a response post for it, and never actually doing it.
Half the time, it’s because I answer it in my head, and forget that I didn’t actually answer it out loud (or in this case, via a blog post).
I do this often. Not just for blog posts.
If I’ve ever left you on Read1, it's (mostly) not because I am ignoring you. Most of the time, I respond in my head, exit out of the message, and completely forget about it. This can happen for text or email.
It's not you, it's me.
Sometimes, I just get really overwhelmed and may take me some time to respond. Again, it's me, not you.
Anyways, back to the blog posts.
I've been reading a ton of blog posts that I've wanted to reply to. Or mostly to spin off my own Reply post to it. I think I've only done one response post because I keep forgetting to physically write it down on my to-do list to start.
Essentially this is just a reminder to myself that I'd still like to do that. And to stop forgetting.
That's all. Maybe it can be a reminder for you too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am blind, it was degenerative so it sounds different than what your kid has.
I have a few pieces of advice. This is more about my own upbringing, so don't take any of it as an accusation towards you.
1) Don't hide things about their condition or prospects.
I grew up in a very loving home. However, my parents found out I was going blind when I was ~8, I didn't find out until I was 13.  My mother wanted to protect me from 'being the blind kid'. But I was. Not knowing made everything so much harder and more confusing.
2) Don't rely too much on technology. Stick and dog are the best tools blind people have. Everything else, in my opinion, is a flash in the pan and won't have long term support. Not made by blind people and with minimal consulting for them. Like what a sighted person thinks a blind person needs after closing their eyes and walking around their house for a few minutes. (Screen readers are useful, I'm not talking about those.)
For a piece of tech I was excited for and is now dystopian: https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete
3) Foster independence. The world is not made for us. It's also full of high speed metal deathtraps. The easiest thing to do is stay inside where I know where everything is. Even walking to the grocery store is a deeply uncomfortable endeavor. But I need to do it. I need to be able to live with that discomfort and not let it dissuade me from living the most human life I can.
The blind cane is very valuable. It took me too long to accept blindness as an identity, get over the shame, and start using it. I lost a lot of time to that.
Blindness sucks in every conceivable way. It affects every part of ones life. But I had a good childhood and I have a good life. All things considered, I'm extremely lucky for the circumstances of my birth because of the family I was born into. You can't take away the blindness but you can still give them a wonderful life.]]></summary>

While I am no Nietzsche or Kafka, I live in one, like any person in today's world—a world undoubtedly centered around a prominent theme: patriotism.
What even is patriotism? The word often carries different meanings depending on who you ask. Some define it as love and loyalty to one's country, a commitment to uphold a national belief or the core values they personally hold dear. Others, however, may view it with suspicion—closely associated with nationalism, pride, and even exclusion. At its core, patriotism is often seen as an allegiance to a flag, regardless of a country’s flaws. Living within a status quo, steadfast in t…]]></summary>

The University Days: A Sea of Confusion
When I started my programming journey in university, I was like a ship without a compass, drifting from one technology to another without a clear direction.
Mistake 1: YouTube Tutorial Hell
I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials, jumping from one video to another. While these tutorials provided quick wins, they didn't help me build a solid foundation. I was coding, but not really understanding.

Terrorism, at least least in my view, is an attack that either intentionally targets civilians or is truly indiscriminate, and is aimed at producing political cha age by causing fear.
By those definitions, I think this is clearly not terrorism. (Though we might learn more information about who was targeted that could change this assessment.) Admittedly, my definitions only imperfectly track the way the word is used in the west, but I think that's only due to frequent misuse of the term for political ends.
I would worry about a definition of terrorism that creates an incentive to avoid this type of warfare in favor of dropping bombs.]]></summary>

Introduction: Radical critique as a forward strategy
 Neoliberal globalization has substantially transformed the landscape in which organized labour sought to advance its interests during Fordism. The scaling up of market relations and capital movements, the subsequent erosion of national Keynesian fiscal and monetary policy paradigms, and deregulation of labour market institutions, including collective bargaining and flexibilization of contracts, has eroded the presence and capacity of unions to…]]></summary>

One thing that I think that frequently eludes people in this discussion is that US manufacturing has pretty much been constantly growing for the past century; just its share of GDP has fallen as other sectors have grown faster.  And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation.
I think the actual outcome of this policy is mixed.  I think it was a big case of corporate welfare that will result in somewhat increased chip production in the US.  I think this is a win for national security.  I don't think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won't be a win for economic output or quality of life.]]></summary>

Title: What Is A Woman
Subtitle: A Short Gender Egoist Simplification
Date: 17 Sep 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/09/17/what-is-a-woman/

 Any feminine-aligned adult individual who develops self-content within womanhood, female identity/conventions which vary from cultural region to cultural region. 
 Any individual who activates certain — but not strictly all — social aesthetics and conduct in order to be in line with traits conventionally associated with women. 
 Any individual who dissolves the sacredness of taxonomy with her conscious existence as a woman, regardless of essentialist wailing about perceived "Flaws," "Defects" or "Inauthenticity". 
 (Cisgender women, that is, women who affirm their having been assigned "Female" at birth and who pursue femininity in agreement with this, experience much of the same hatred and dehumanization that transgender women face each and every day, especially when it comes to reproductive capability, physical appearance, etc. All women, transgender or cisgender, suffer patriarchy in similar but unique circumstances.) 
 A woman is a person who delivers raw self-contents into the versatile bounds that form the living picture of a woman.
 She is her own while engaging the social sensors that call out "Woman!" 
 She is free and she is entire.]]></summary>

The board of directors of 23andMe just resigned in protest. The CEO, Anne Wojcicki (who's sister Susan died of lung cancer last month, and was the former CEO of YouTube) had tried to low ball take the company private at only $0.40 a share -- a more than 96% drop from its deSPAC price.
For reference, right now the market cap of 23andMe is $172 million, its closest competitor Ancestry.com was bought out by the Blackstone group for $4.7 billion, and cumulative sales of KeyTruda - an anti-cancer drug in the same family as the one being developed by 23andMe had cumulative sales of $25 billion by 2023.
Feels like the main thing holding this company back is the CEO and lack of corporate governance (due to majority shareholder control resting in the hands of one person)]]></summary>

Set up a shell company to sell pagers to your enemy's shell company.

Hack the backend server, send a coordinated page to all the pagers at the same time. You've just injured and identified most of your enemies, incapacitated them, completely broken their communication network and effectively given you weeks of disarray to do whatever you want to further disrupt them.

It explores the legal history of surcharges and underscores that there are precedents (i.e., in 1974, 1981, and 1992) for their complete removal. The paper also shows that surcharges are a burden on indebted countries and that the Fund's official arguments for retaining them do not hold.

Although it was aimed at harming Israel's adversaries, third-party countries may now hesitate to involve Israel in their supply chains. There's also the risk that other major producers could replicate this tactic, potentially leading to further escalation in the region or beyond.
In the short term, it's a smart strategy for Israel, but they've likely opened Pandora's box in the process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing hard things is important. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. And lets be honest. It feels good to hit the bed at the end of the day when you know you worked hard. That self satisfaction is indescribable.
But how to do hard things? The answer is 'deliberate mental training'. When I was young I would get lazy, feel bad about myself and then get the work done. If I generated enough momentum it would last long, otherwise it would just last a few days and the cycle would repeat.
My perspective changed over the years. I don't know if it was one podcast or one book that did it or a bunch of things. But I came to look at myself more as an intellectual athlete. And just like an athlete needs physical training to get better, I needed mental training.
A lot goes into an athlete achieving peak performance. Deliberate pracise, the right mindset, diet, the right tools and lets admit it - some genetics. It is the same for an intellectual athlete. Focus on what you can control and get better. The point is to improve 'your' peak performance and not to compete with some genetic freak training since they were born.
As far as frameworks go this is both very practical and very powerful. If you are out of shape and want to run a marathon you don't expect to do it one day one. You work up to it. You don't see some pro marathon runner on social media doing insane times and feel discouraged. You know your body is malleable. You can see the fat on it. The pain in your calves when you run. You know it gets better.
The same is true for our brains. Mental training makes your brain stronger. Be able to do hard things. To get started and stay focused. To not get frustrated when you hit blocks. All these are part of mental training. Something you get better at. And you need to keep training to not get out of shape. And if you ever go out of shape or get lazy you know you just need to train yourself back up to your glory days.
Start training.]]></summary>

This was understood, and will be moving forward as well.
This is Amazon having it both ways, which is what a lot of companies are doing. You can work remotely 'sometimes,' with a secret definition of 'sometimes,' operating in the background.
I found this paragraph to be somewhat galling since, like, if you're sick you shouldn't work at all, you should be focussing on getting well. Ditto if your kid is sick. Raising one or more whole other human/s is a super important thing. One result I saw from the pandemic is fathers doing more of the childcare, and what full-RTO like this fundamentally does is shift that dynamic back to where it was before.
Shame on Amazon.]]></summary>

 All the wretched creatures of the earth wish to return to the sea. This I am now certain of. 
 The ocean is divided into five major zones, each characterized by their depth. Depth can be thought of best in terms of proximity to the sun and the earth’s core. The Epipelagic zone is characterized by its close proximity to light, the essential source of energy for all life on Earth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No one appears to have mentioned the important meta game going on: Intel bidding as a credible alternative supplier.
For Intel, by bidding they get to undercut AMD's profits.
For Sony, they get a credible alternative which they can pretend would be a viable choice. Thus forcing a slightly better deal from AMD.
We saw similar articles related to the Switch 2. That time it was AMD acting as spoiler to Nvidia. Nvidia reportedly got the contract. That time too we got news articles lamenting this loss for AMD.
As a gamedev I have a different perspective: Sony and Nintendo would be fools to give up backwards compatibility just for savings on chips.
Switching vendors does not just invalidate old games compatibility, it also requires retooling for their internal libraries. Console games, outside small or open source engines, use proprietary graphics api. Those apis are tied to the hardware. With this coming generation from Nintendo, and the "current gen" from Sony and Xbox they've been able to mostly reuse much of their software investment. I'd case more but this is obviously nda, other devs should be able to confirm.
Thus I don't think AMD for switch2 or Intel for ps6 was ever a credible path. Their bids existed to keep the existing vendor from getting overly greedy and ruining the parade for everyone. This is important, famously the original Xbox got hamstrung in the market by Nvidia's greed and refusal to lower prices as costs went down.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.
After I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.
Anyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.
My photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I'm choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.
Anyways.
For those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:
JEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.
Notes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.
Snaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a lot of folks I know through Cohost and gamedev, I've started using Bear for blogging. This means I've left Wordpress behind after nearly 15 years on that service.
Bear is a fantastic blogging service for people who like to touch computers... but don't want to touch computers That Much. It has a web-based post composition UI which takes markdown, which is about all I want. I want to minimize the UI fuckery needed to put words on the internet, and these days, Wordpress is all about UI fuckery.
I migrated over the vast majority of posts from my old Wordpress site and laboriously set up URL aliases, so all of them should continue to receive any incoming links they had in the past. I also took some time to heal some link rot in the older posts back between 2013-2016 or so... I was linking to a lot of twines which don't seem to be online at all anymore. Where possible, I've left a note about missing content.
Bear provides everything you need to migrate Wordpress content, but it isn't a simple task. The Bear documentation states that it takes the site owner only about 30 minutes to migrate a blog with about 60 posts, but it took me several days of intermittent work. That was mostly because I cared so much about setting up the dates and aliases correctly.
If you're seeing this in RSS, then you have proof that the RSS migration worked perfectly as well. (I don't have proof of that yet, which is part of why I'm running this post.) I selected Bear partially because it was so easy for me to confirm that I could set up an RSS alias identical to the one Wordpress had given me--and that whoever was following me from back in ancient days wouldn't lose track of what I was doing over here.
Thank you to Dante and Bruno for showing me this tool! It's 3 USD cheaper per month than my current Wordpress package, and a lot simpler.]]></summary>

I brought up that my digital art journey began on deviantART, touching on how critical that place was for the skills I developed and the artist I’d become.
2006 wasn’t the start of that site by any means but it was pretty early. Early enough in both its respective era and the greater “access to internet” era that its userbase skewed a lot younger and the community there was dictated by that. My friends and I there would pass around questionnaires that were fun “get to know me” kinda things and you’d build a more tight-knit group of folks around that!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you thinking about starting a blog but feel like you haven't found "your voice" yet?
That's understandable; many people feel the same way. Luckily, there's a solution to the problem:
Start blogging!
There's no better way. Or rather, it's the only way.
We might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it's only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.
We find ourselves by connecting with others.
My first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.
This blog is my first "serious" one in English. It's still relatively new and doesn't have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I'll start a separate blog about writing online. I don't know; time will tell...
What I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.
Are you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice? Get them out there! That's where they do good – both for others and for yourself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[over the weekend, i decided i wanted to add a now page to my site. the problem here is that i am bad at remembering to update things (especially more than one thing). in my ideal world, i could have it live update with things like what movies i've watched recently (from letterboxd), tv (trakt, which i don't currently use but maybe should), music (only once i fix my scrobbling setup), books (storygraph), etc etc etc.
at a glance, you'd assume that bear doesn't support this sort of thing, given its static-approach. i would say that this is a limitation of imagination; you can actually just throw whatever in here, including in the header and footer.
my first test for this is using htmx to populate a list of recently watched movies (served by a small app at blog-data.jkap.io) on page load. while it's not perfect (i don't love the "loading" flash and layout shift) it was easy to setup and works Well Enough for now.
when i say easy, i mean it. this is the extent of the code:
<div hx-get="https://blog-data.jkap.io/letterboxd" hx-trigger="load">
  <span hx-indicator>loading...</span>
</div>

you can see it in action on my now page. i'm planning to add more in here over time. just gimme a bit.]]></summary>
