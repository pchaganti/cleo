In beautiful EU bureaucratic style It's a framework for how to talk about how a European Cloud could look like.
It's not about technical standards. It's about how we can talk about how we can think of maybe eventually deciding on how we can come up with standards that might one day lead to talk about implementations.
It represents to me everything that is wrong with the EU today. A bureaucratic monster that can't decide how to talk about things or come to any form of alignment.]]></summary>

Buying this house was not the easiest. During the entire nightmare of a process, I remember thinking that I wanted to blog about it (I wasn’t writing yet then) in detail, so that all first time homebuyers could avoid the stress we endured. Also, no one ever teaches you any of this in school, so I’m not exactly sure how anyone could know the process until they’re knees deep in it already.
Yes, there are plenty of articles out there about the house buying process, but it still doesn’t truly prepare you for the real thing. At least it didn’t for us.

Why are these service providers being punished for what their users do? Specifically, these service providers? Because Google, Discord, Reddit, etc. all  contain some amount of CSAM (and other illegal content), yet I don't see Pichai, Citron, or Huffman getting indicted for anything.
Hell, then there's the actual infrastructure providers too. This seems like a slippery slope with no defined boundaries where the government can just arbitrary use to pin the blame on the people they don't like. Because ultimately, almost every platform with user-provided content will have some quantity of illegal material.

 In this essay I explore the relations between contemporary anarchism and animal rights/liberation through the lens of Deleuze/Guattari-inflected complex systems theory.

As the United States’ position of dominance in the world has been challenged in recent decades, economic sanctions have taken a more central position in its strategy for maintaining global power and influence. As Stuart Davis and Immanuel Ness noted in a 2022 article arguing that sanctions are a form of war, “the US has depended increasingly on economic, political and cultural hegemony as partial substitutes for military power through the application of economic sanctions.”

It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike?
We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence!
Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it:

- Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLoCihE0eIA
- Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDJpt7RDbRM
Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com
We'd love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community
Oh, and it's launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.
As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.
Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.
And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.
Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.]]></summary>

Woke up a few hours early on a Saturday morning to make a cup of coffee and get this written before we are out and about today.
I went back to work on Monday + Tuesday feeling absolutely sick and miserable. I really struggled but pushed through it to ensure that the team was prepared before I take a few days off next week. If only my co-workers could’ve seen how terrible I felt running all of the meetings. Thankfully stopped feeling like the walking dead by Wednesday.
Still trying to get myself out of this feeling I’ve been feeling lately, whatever it may be.
Blaugust 2024 is almost over. Will I make it to 31 days? Spoiler Alert: I still don’t have any pre-written posts. I’ve been winging it all month. Can you tell?

I refuse to use the official mobile app. I've always used Baconreader and then Relay on Android. Relay survived the API changes and adopted a subscription model.

For comparison, configuring a network interface using Control Panel is simple, straight forward and allows me to change all the settings I want. Trying to do the same thing using the Settings app is complex, it hides pretty nuch all of the advanced settings that you want to see or change. And on top of that, it doesn’t even show you how long that interface has been connected to the network and how much data was transferred both ways: incredible debugging info lost.
Oh, and the fact that you can’t tick which updates you want and which you don’t…
I’m pretty sure others have other gripes with the “streamlined experience”.]]></summary>

A week later, I got a Find My notification that they had been spotted – at the same sports field. I figured what the hell, put on a podcast and drove the hour to see if I could find them. Worst case scenario, a couple of hours of driving.
Using Find My and the directional feature points you in the right direction to within feet, I found them in the tall grass.

All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let's give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn't much to a determined spammer, but I didn't want to be…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A counter point on premium VR headsets. They are teleportation devices.
I've used every popular VR device, but one Vision Pro experience stood out - 'The Haleakala environment'[1]
It was literally like being transported there. I know because I had been in that exact spot a few years before. I have a rich visual memory which served as reference, and no exaggeration, it felt like was there. I was immediately in tears. It was profound.
The Vision pro's lack of a killer app because development is unintuitive, userbase is small, the UX is alien and the hardware costs of constructing these experience is still rather high. Give it a few years. The hardware is already there. This isn't a solution in search of a problem. This is PalmOS, a solution that is too early to the market.
I have family with disabilities. Being able to teleport my loved ones to places they could never go themselves is worth the $3000. If I could record my most profound memories with 'VR recorder', I would. My parent missed my graduation because of being continents away. You think they wouldn't want to be teleported to it ? Wedding photographers cost $4000+, so we can relive those memories through shoddy snapshots. Why not be teleported back to the most beautiful day ?
Don't knock it till you try it.

I don’t know of any tonic that’s as good for my mood, energy, and mental health as a solid hour of writing in the morning before life starts. It feels like a luxury, really, having the time to do this, and I’m grateful.

 “Anarchism is still the most beautiful ideal, and I think someday it will come,” wrote Lau Chung-Si (Ray Jones) from a small apartment in San Francisco. At the time he put these words to paper in 1974, he was a relic of another time. Jones was a Chinese man who, in 1909, immigrated to the United States and quickly became enamoured with the ideas of anarchism. He was involved in a collective of Chinese American anarchists in San Francisco named Pingsheh (Equality Society). He also attended meetings held by ot…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The full scope of Israel’s assault on Gaza is revealed through its relentless military actions, characterized by indiscriminate violence against women, children, the elderly, and non-combatants. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, the scale of destruction imposed on Gaza is not only devastating but ethically unimaginable. Since the start of the war, and as of the end of November 2023, Israel has reportedly dropped over 25,000 tons of explosives on the Gaza Strip, a force equivalent to two nuclear bombs. This means that the destructive power of the explosives dropped on Gaza in just over two months exceeded that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[4] According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the use of such highly destructive bombs in residential areas constitutes a war crime.

But this piece of common sense seems to have dropped out of the brains – if they have them – of American congressional and white house leaders.

That amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion. Not to be outdone in the stupidity sweepstakes, Joe “Copycat” Biden added his tariffs. They affected batteries, steel, aluminum, semiconductors, solar cells, electric vehicles, critical minerals and more. More

the deprecated format.
Support for v1beta3 configuration will be removed after a minimum of 3 Kubernetes minor releases.
In this article, I'll walk you through key changes;
I'll explain about the kubeadm v1beta4 configuration format,

The problem with this line of thinking -- "If X happens then we'll all be cooked!" -- is that it ignores the fact that X already has been happening and yet life is just fine.
There's an infinite number of pursuits in which expert practitioners could theoretically possess a level of discernment so sublime that nobody else can understand it, let alone appreciate it.
A huge number of these arts will either never be practiced, or were practiced in the past but have already decline. And yet there's no mass ennui or clamoring to steer the Earth into the sun.

My cousins, back in my birth country, will ask: “When are you coming home?” It always stops me in my tracks. I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time.

By categorically saying no to quick calls, you're isolating yourself even more. While it can be distracting to jump on a call while you actually meant to focus on some coding, it can also be great to have a quick chat and brainstorm about an idea rather than let the other person work out the solution in isolation only for me to then suggest a totally different approach in the PR review (yay! asynchronous!).]]></summary>

provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator's point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image=busybox --profile=netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific
necessities, and unfortunately, some can't be debugged by only using the static profiles.

Let's see an example, below Pod specifies runAsUser=1000, runAsGroup=3000 and supplementalGroups=4000 in the Pod's security context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Kubernetes v1.31, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to CPU management capabilities: the distribute-cpus-across-cores option for the CPUManager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.
Understanding the feature
Traditionally, Kubernetes' CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a teenageer a school counselor incorrectly perceived me to be in a crisis and had me sent to 72 hour hold (which stays on certain records for quite a while and can be incredibly disruptive, but that's besides the point) - for some reason I was sent almost 40 miles away in another county in a city I'd never been. The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn't belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn't enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn't have my glasses, phone, or wallet.
I really don't know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car. I had to beg for money and walk the last several miles once I recognized finally where I was. It really sucked, and ever since then I've had a great deal of sympathy for people that are churned through this terrible system and spit right back out with no dignity whatsoever, let alone empathy. This incident disrupted my life irreversibly (ended up missing tests and having to do a medical withdrawal from school, lost scholarships, etc) and derailed a lot of things I had wanted to do for many, many years. The hospital/medical care industrial complex doesn't optimize for empathy. They're just trying to get the bodies through as quickly as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'd be amazed how bad hospitals can be at keeping track of fairly critical things.
I had a cousin who voluntarily checked himself into the hospital related to severe withdrawal symptoms (and had bouts of psychosis related to said with withdrawal - meth addictions are nasty).  His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.
Late that night, he was discharged. Not even "he checked himself out". The hospital discharged him (and that's over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).
He had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn't remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn't get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.
The hospital had his mother's contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.
We still don't know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.
Forcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I'm furious about it.  Apparently it's common and not even something there's any recourse for.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design.
This is a super underappreciated fact!  It's often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.
Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.
Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.
Think of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.
For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.  Blacksmiths had a legitimately intellectual job back in the day!]]></summary>

"I don't want to work in IT anymore."
I saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.
I had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!
But over time, something started to feel off. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.
Then one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.
– Yes, I can't imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.
In that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!
When I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.
Fast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.
And when it comes to IT, I'm more passionate about it now that it's a hobby instead of a career. It's fun again!
Are you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.
Chok Dee, as they say in Thailand.]]></summary>

I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

"I know you might be worried about regrets later, but sometimes it's okay to break the ritual, to interrupt the flow, to just pause and breathe it all in. No achievement is going to light up above your head when you write all the words, read all the books, collect all the things. Not one that'll be worth it in the long run anyway. Be joyful when you can, be reflective when you need to be, but most of all, focus on being. If that means writing, great. If that means quiet, that's great too." by Netigen

- You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support.
- Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future.
- Invest in good docs, even if you're not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.

 It is government suppression. It is tyranny. 
 Even until now, I am unable to give a viewpoint on whether the ending of a human life is a good or bad thing, regardless of someone giving me a good or bad name for it. Daring to be brief about whether or not to end a human life, I am neither for nor against either choice, because I am for the sake of everybody’s happiness, with an unshakeable faith to stand on the impossible conviction of working for the freedom of any or even all people. 
 I wish that I will behave in accordance with the demands of reason and not based on the demands of immediate emotions or instincts based on material desire. If this course of action is in a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'm living in a different universe sometimes. The consensus on HN seems to be that you can be pretty productive with LLMs as coding assistants, but every time I try I find it borderline impossible to get functional code even for pretty straightforward prompts.
I decided to fire up GPT-4o again today to see if maybe things have gotten better over the past few months.
I asked GPT to write code to render a triangle using Vulkan (a 3D graphics API). There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4's training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it's not a simple case of copy/paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)
Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:
GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer. So that's a guaranteed memory access violation right off the bat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet's cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn't new
enough to have support for this feature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some random bits of context.
This conflict goes back a long time. In the early 1990's, with online journals just getting started, MIT was able to insist on principles like "anyone physically in the library has full access, even if they are not otherwise affiliated with MIT". A couple of years later, power shifted, and Elsevier could "our terms, take it or leave it". Then three decades, a human generation, of Elsevier rent-seeking, and so many people working towards Open Access, unbundling, google scholar, arXiv, sci-hub, and so on. Societal change can be so very slow, nonmonotonic, and profoundly discouraging. And yet here we are, making progress.
For anyone unfamiliar with "author [...] required to relinquish copyright [...] generous reuse rights", journals would require authors to completely sign over copyright, so authors' subsequent other-than-fair-use usage of fragments would be a copyright violation. Rarely enforced, but legally you'd have to obtain permission. While some institutions sign contracts easily, and struggle with the fallout later, MIT legal culture has been pain-up-front careful with contracts. Which is sometimes painful. But IIRC, we're today using X Windows instead of CMU's Andrew, because MIT could say "sure!" while CMU was "sure, err,... we'll get back to you... some mess to clean up first".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working as a SRE for a year in a large global company broke me out of this "panic" mode described in this post. To a business, every problem seems like a world-ending event. It's very easy to give in to panic in those situations. However, in reality, it's rarely that bad, and even if it is, you'll probably survive without harm. The key in these situations, and what I try to do (totally relate to breaking out in a sweat, that still happens to me, just happened yesterday) is to take 5-10 minutes before doing any action to try to fix it and sketch it out, think about it as clearly as you can. Fear interferes with your ability to reason rationally. Mashing buttons in a panic can make your problems spiral even worse (seen that happen). Disrupting that fear circuit any way you can is important. Splashing my face and hands with extremely cold water is my trick.
Then after you go through a few of these, you'll realize it really isn't too bad and you've dealt with bad situations before and you'll gain the confidence to know you can deal with it, even when there's no one you can reach out to for help.]]></summary>

 Another fighter became a martyr. On August 9, our comrade and anarchist-internationalist from Russia, Vladislav Iurchenko (nom de guerre “Pirate”), was killed in battle. He was 22 years old. Vladislav was part of the “Siberian Battalion” of the International Legion, and he was martyred in a fight during a landing operation on the Kinburn Spit. 
 Before coming to Ukraine, Vladislav participated in actions of solidarity with anarchist and other anti-government prisoners. He fought against Russian fascism and imperialism. Knowing that anarchists in Ukraine…]]></summary>

I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Kubernetes 1.31, by default kubectl now uses the WebSocket protocol
instead of SPDY for streaming.
This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs
matter.
Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that's bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create
a shell in a running container from your local…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might answer that you haven't yet (but wish you had). However, if you're in your 30s, have a well-established job, and a busy life (away from academia), you might respond, "I don't know, since college maybe?"
Sure, you've learned. You might have explored a topic you're curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: "all the time!"
Please, re-read the question.
I didn't ask when was the last time you learned something new. I'm talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.
Maybe I'm alone in this feeling, but it's been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.
That's why, from now on, I'm going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.
I'm currently working on my syllabus, which I'll gladly share with you once I've finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other's schedules).
Take a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.
I can't wait to learn with you all.]]></summary>

Title: The Hooligans, the Stingies, the Starved People and the Bad Asses
Date: 1985
Notes: This is a translation of a leaflet written in 1985 by anarchists frequenting the Chrysallida social space in Limassol, Cyprus.
Source: https://movementsarchive.org/doku.php?id=en:leaflets:xrisalllida:kakakakathkia

 The football league is over; the mass rallies of July have also passed. The Cuéllar initiative froze, as usual, and everything indicated that Cypriot society would remain for about a month without mass spectacles to organize its boredom. 
 And suddenly “chaos” erupts in Germasogeia. A new “fruit” for the “Cypriot reality”; and the hysteria of the occasion is analogous. The newspapers are shouting about hooligans, they are searching for the “brains” (in this place it see…]]></summary>
