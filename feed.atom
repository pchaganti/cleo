- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You'll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn't ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

Modi’s right-wing populism, rooted in Hindu fascism, enabled and cemented his rise to national prominence. Today, South Africa risks following a similarly destructive trajectory as political elites increasingly try to incite xenophobia against African and Asian migrants to redirect anger over a devastating economic and social crisis onto vulnerable scapegoats.

The Statue of Liberty may have welcomed some of the “huddled masses” from Europe at different times, but no such welcome was ever given to people from south of the border. There, a different attitude has prevailed.
Donald Trump’s MAGA hate speech includes such descriptions of non-European immigrants as “stone cold killers,” “immigrant criminals from the dungeons of the world,” “rapist,” “pet eaters” — or “invaders” from across the southern border. Some may find Trump’s words pleasing and others dreadful, but he is far from original. More

For the past few days, I’ve been contemplating abandoning my Moleskine journal for my newly acquired Hobonici notebook1.

I’ve been diligently writing with my favorite Kaco pen, but now that my Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen has arrived, I really want to start journaling with it.

I've got some small/tiny gamedev projects on my pocket that I haven't documented here in my Bearblog account. The first one is an ASCII Snake game only using the curses library. There will be another similar post on making Snake game using Raylib.
#1 Libraries

#define MAX_SCORE 256
#define FRAME_TIME 180000

typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Vec2;

int score = 0;
char score_message[32];

bool skip = false;
bool is_running = true;

int screen_width = 25;
int screen_height = 20;

1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.
2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.
So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”]]></summary>

In our defense, we just descaled it, and the app didn’t notify us… so how are we supposed to know? Either way, I have been drinking freshly brewed coffee this week, instead of the typical instant/pre-made coffee I’ve succumbed to during the weeks in between.

Partly, it's because I'm an amateur. But that's not the main reason. Nor is it a matter of perfection.
It's because I find it relaxing.
Coding is like meditation for me. A perfect blend of focus and relaxation—a kind of timeless void. I'm often surprised when I look at the clock and realize how much time has passed.

Title: The Gaza Ghetto Uprising
Date: May 2024
Source: <brooklynrail.org/2024/05/field-notes/The-Gaza-Ghetto-Uprising>

 TO THE HEART OF IT: Gaza has been a free kill zone and a “concentration camp” (to quote Israel’s National Security Director Giora Eiland in 2004), long before October 7. 
 In light of this, the most radical position comes directly from the simplest question: are Palestinians human beings? If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. 
 Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…]]></summary>

All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.]]></summary>

At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate’s potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.]]></summary>

In prepping my lessons, the slides, the activities, etc., I have to always be thinking about how all those things affect the kids. How do they enhance their understanding? How do they engage them? Could I be more flexible in certain areas, or are there skills or topics I really need the kids to understand in a certain way? How can I design this class such that they interact more with each other, have more agency over their learning, can keep up?
Dropping the ball on any aspect of teaching feels huge. When a lesson flops, I feel like I wasted my kids’ time and mine. My evenings are spent thinking about how to get the next one right. There’s no part of this job where I feel I can relax my grip or afford …]]></summary>

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them.

These feel like the real signs that winter is here, not a date on the calendar.

The office is eerily quiet. A and her posse are out of town for a work retreat, and I'm the only one left behind sitting in their pod of desks.

Yes there seems to be lots of potential. Yes we can brainstorm things that should work. Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it's a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it's incredibly hard to hide those from them.
Show me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.
LLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don't have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It's a really hard problem with LLM based tools.
There is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we've exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?
I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It's my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.
GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.
For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build "expert bots" that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.
If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.
Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.
Chasing after model improvements and "GPT-5 will be PHD-level" is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.
Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don't know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.
Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That's a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.]]></summary>

To make matters a bit worse, I haven't felt good about retreating into the places that I typically do. A lot of my blogging friends are in pain over the election.

In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit "weird" (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.]]></summary>

So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who'd been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn't remember the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China's income level. We quantify China's consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country's production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.]]></summary>

Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It's also a large barrier to adoption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!
Here's a start --
"Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc": No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
"Who uses Keras in production": Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn't all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
"Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019": I didn't! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering & architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!]]></summary>

Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.]]></summary>
