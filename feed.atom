        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While researching a post I promised on why France collapsed so quickly in World War Two I came across this video on the Russo-German Reinsurance Treaty. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It will give you a much more balanced view of the man–you’ll not be looking at him through the lens of World War Two or World War One for that matter.
Finally, I think all of us can agree that Disney Star Wars has been 90% joke. All except for Rogue One and the recently completed season two of Andor. As the Critical Drinker says, season two is “the kind of TV your sitting on the edge of your seat in complete silence knowing this is the kind of TV that comes along once every 5-10 years.”
I’ve re-evaluated my favorite Star Wars movies–not a single TV show, not even the silly Mandalorian makes the top five, except Andor. Obviously A New Hope is number one. Rogue One is number two, Empire Strikes Back is number three, Andor both seasons are #4 and number five is a toss up between Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.  What say you people?]]></summary>

The Embassy shooter’s manifesto is short, to the point and entirely sane. I won’t wring my hands and say I think he was wrong, I will merely note that it is illegal to kill Israelis, and that unlike the butchers of Gaza, he will be punished.
Explication
May 20, 2025
Halintar is a word that means something like thunder or lightning. In the wake of an act people look for a text to fix its meaning, so here’s an attempt. The atrocities committed by Israelis against Palestine defy description and defy quantification. Instead of reading descriptions mostly we watch them unfold on video, sometimes live. After a few months of rapidly mounting death tolls Israel had obliterated the capacity to even continue counting the dead, which has served its ge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good start.
So, someone killed two Israeli diplomats in D.C. and everyone is crying crocodile tears and screaming about anti-semitism. (One of them was a Christian fundamentalist, as an aside.)
These two diplomats are agents of a genocidal state. Their job is to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Israel so that Israel can kill more Palestinians, wipe out the last remaining hospital, torture Palestinians, rape Palestinians (including, it appears, with dogs), deliberately snipe children in the head, cause a huge famine, and turn every building in Gaza into dust.
And I’ve left a number of sickening crimes out.
So, am I sad they are dead? No. Am I going to pretend I give a shit when someone who supports genocide winds up dead? No. Every single pious well wishing for Biden is the equivalent of wishing Petain, the leader of Vichy France, who helped the Holocaust along, a good life.
All of these people are knowingly involved in genocide. They have had many opportunities to stop supporting mass murder and they have refused every single one of them.
They are all, forgive me for using the word, evil. The bad guys. Torture. Rape. Mass murder. Deliberate killing of children.
It is my dream that every single one of them will eventually hang from the neck for their crimes. No exceptions. And I think it would be wise to add the corporate leadership of companies like Palantir and Microsoft, both of which are helping the genocide along.
This is a moral stance, but it is also a pragmatic stance. People who have gotten away with genocide once are not the sort of people anyone wise wants in their society, or in a position of power anywhere. Once could easily become twice.
You don’t even have to give a damn about Palestinians, you just have to have good judgment and a concern for your own neck and the lives, rectums and limbs of people you care about.
From the neck. Till dead. For everyone who knowing aided or committed genocide.
And, for a little leavening of the anger and rage, a classic:]]></summary>

This caused stocks to trend down and even the dollar. Simply put the US is adding a lot of debt, reducing revenue by cutting taxes and there’s wild amounts of uncertainties due to Trump’s tariff and trade policies. Bond traders are worried, Japan is reducing its Treasuries holdings, and everyone is looking imploringly at the Federal Reserve.
As a friend quipped “the economy is perfectly healthy, as long as we keep it on life support.”
Which is to say the likely result is that the Federal Reserve will have to step up and start buying Treasuries again. The last time it did that was during Covid.

Here’s the thing, Rogan could lean left (not centrist, left). Remember this?

Here’s the deal: there will never been a popular centrist online presence which is stronger than the right wing populist one. Centrists don’t do popular. They don’t have the instincts. It’s all about pandering to elite and PMC ideology: thing Yglesias and Ezra Klein and their ilk. They can run numbers, sure, but no one gets super worked up. No one who wasn’t going to vote Democratic no matter what loves them.

Since Industrialization military power has been a function of three factors:
Technology.
Industrial Capacity.
Population.
As time goes buy population becomes less important (see, rise of drones), but it still matters. Think of it as something like Tech x IndCap x (Pop x .5).
America has a powerful military though most of the technology is one or two generations old. The general consensus is that Pakistan’s Chinese jets (themselves last gen tech) out-performed India’s Western jets.
At this point, China is ahead in about 80% of tech fields. China has 31% of world industrial capacity, and the US about 16%, meaning that China has about twice as much. Further China owns the entire supply chain for many of its technologies, whereas the US’s supply chai…]]></summary>

Some of the shit I read coming from the UK is just…it’s hard to believe it can be true, it’s so retarded.

It takes true talent to make that possible.
Just before 7.15pm more than 20 uniformed police, some equipped with tasers, forced their way into Westminster Meeting House. They broke open the front door without warning or ringing the bell first, searching the whole building and arresting six women attending the meeting in a hired room.
