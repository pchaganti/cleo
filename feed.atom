        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As students worldwide head back to school this fall, in Gaza, there are no schools left. The U.N. considers the systemic obliteration of the education system by the Israeli military to be a “scholasticide” — all universities, over 80% of schools, the Central Archives of Gaza, and at least 13 libraries have been destroyed, as of April 2024, in Israel’s relentless bombing campaign. Almost 10,000 students are dead and 16,000 wounded, many killed in attacks on schools being used as sites of refuge.
Academics and university administrators in Gaza released an open letter asking for solidarity and resistance from the rest of the world: “We call upon our colleagues in the homeland and internationally to support our steadfast attempts to defend and preserve our universities for the sake of the future of our people, and our ability to remain on our Palestinian land in Gaza. We built these universities from tents. And from tents, with the support of our friends, we will rebuild them once again.”
As a graduate student, an aspiring professor, and the child of a Jewish academic, I take this call for solidarity seriously. Where and how do we learn ideologies of resistance, radicalism, and revolution? Once we have inherited a radical idea, what do we do with it? And how do we choose what ideas not to inherit?

These days, I find myself in a strange place. Despite the Democrats’ miraculous replacement of Biden, Trump’s reelection remains distinctly possible. I studied authoritarianism for my master’s degree, and I strongly believe that a second Trump presidency would represent the end of American democracy. Yet even so, I find myself frequently tempted to dismiss commentators’ pleas as hyperbolic handwringing. I think I’m probably not alone in this confusing toggling between panic and blaséness. After some soul-searching, I think one of the reasons for the ever-present allure of complacency, other than the natural human tendency towards denial, is Trump’s humor.

In mid-July, I wanted to find a way to challenge myself in August for my birthday month. I initially wanted to do a photo challenge (a photo a day?) of sorts.

I had no idea what it was but then I read this bit under What is Blaugust?:
The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world.

He mentioned that he had worked as a hospital curator for four years. He provided support to people during their final days. When the interviewer asked him what people wished for, he answered without hesitation:
”That they had done more.”
This was the common reply from people on their deathbed. Not that they had built an empire or made a fortune. Small things like spending more time…
…with their children.
…in nature.
…with friends.
…exploring their surroundings.
…on hobbies.
The simple things in life – and the truly important ones.
Most of us could do this without too much trouble. We might blame it on not having enough time, but is that really true? Will we be able to say with a clear conscience, ”I didn’t have the time”, when we’re facing death?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Bearblog doesn't (currently) strip location data from your uploads, so you need to do it yourself
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.
If you have posted images via the native bearblog insert image feature in the past, it is a good idea to check that your location hasn't been inadvertently leaked.
Also, if you would like this to be solved for everyone, please help to upvote the suggestion to preprocess images.
Android
I'm not too sure how to this natively in Android (do let me know if you have an elegant way to remove location data!) - I'm wary to recommend any of the numerous apps that seem to do this, as I'm not sure which of them can be trusted.
EDIT: Jd dropped me an email recommending Aves (F-Droid|Github) for Android :-
Just saw your post and I was thinking to write the same a few days ago.
To remove metadata on your android phone, Aves is a really good gallery app. You can edit all of your metadata and also sort images in different ways.
It is available on playstore as well as fdroid.
Thanks for the recommendation! I haven't been in touch with the Android ecosystem for a while, and it's great to see photo/file manager apps which are not riddled with ads.
iOS
In the meantime, if you're on iOS 17+, there is an option in the photo picker when inserting images, to remove location and resize the image:
Example images (of a sunrise on Alishan)
Original image, with GPS metadata:

Resized image, without GPS metadata:

This might seem like an odd comment, but it stems from my reading of another post, A Brief Case on Bearblog. The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.
This thought reminded me of an excellent essay by Paul Graham, Write Like You Talk. In it, he argues that if you want people to connect with you, you must write in a way that feels familiar to them. Essentially, the essay rests on the assumption that we all speak similarly but think differently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A month ago, I decided to shut down this blog. The next day I changed my mind, which I wrote about in the post "The blog that refuses to die."
Yesterday, I launched a membership called Birming Buddies. When I woke up this morning after a long and good night's sleep, I realized it didn't feel right. I have now removed the page.
It probably sounds crazy – and maybe it is.
But neither the decision to start Birming Buddies nor to shut down the blog were impulsive actions. It's always been a long period of consideration before I hit the OK button. Once I've done that, I quickly realize whether it was the right decision or not.
It's as if I can't reason my way through some decisions. I have to put them into action to really be able to determine what is right and what is not. Not very practical, I know, but that's apparently how I work.
Anyway, no harm done. The member fees are  refunded and the blog lives on. And I'll continue to develop the Bearming theme. Today I released an add-on to show excerpts of your blog posts (see example on my home page), and a new color palette named Green Screen.
I hope you have the patience to continue following my rather crooked blog journey. Hopefully, the transparency will bring some comfort to those who can relate.
By the way, I also launched a newsletter today. Subscribe now, who knows, maybe I'll delete it tomorrow ;)
I wish you a wonderful weekend!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ruby has a surprising hack in its interpreter. If the file starts with a shebang line, ruby will skip all lines until it encounters a shebang line which contains the string "ruby" in it.
This lets you start out as a shell script and then after some setup switch over to ruby
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 "$@"

echo "I am a bash line too but I will never run"

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts "I run in ruby"

There is some ugliness to this hack though. The interpreter only looks for the word "ruby" so the shebang line could be whatever including.
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 "$@"

echo "I am a bash line too but I will never run"

#!/I/am/a/rubyist
puts "I run in ruby"

will work but
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 "$@"

echo "I am a bash line too but I will never run"

#!/bin/rb
puts "I run in ruby"

will result in a print of "no Ruby script found in input"
Source: ruby.c#L2681
I am not a fan of such hacks in a language. Python lets you do something similar too - but it takes advantage of the fact that triple-quoted strings are side-effect free in Python and """": is the same as just a : which is two empty strings followed by a true in bash.
#!/bin/bash
'''':
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate.sh

exec python $0 "$@"

echo "I am a bash line too but I will never run"
'''

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no greater strategic madness than the belief that nuclear superiority must be maintained at each rung of the nuclear ladder in order to maintain deterrence.  U.S. weapons technology was a major driver of escalation dominance throughout the 1950s and 1960s along with the belief that the Soviet Union would move to a level of nuclear conflict that the United States could not counter.  “Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb” parodied these fears, and the arms control and disarmament developments of the 1970s and 1980s helped to defuse them.  Sadly, the Biden administration has taken a step that suggests a return to escalation dominance, which will spiral a Pentagon budget that will soon reach $1 trillion per year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to form, Trump has now taken to calling Kamala Harris “low IQ” and “stupid,” racist tropes he draws on whenever he’s confronted by minorities, women or both. But for all her faults, Harris isn’t stupid. In fact, she’s demonstrated her ability to swiftly master and deftly deploy the finer points of Clintonian triangulation, the strategy of political bait-and-switch that prioritizes running against the core issues held by her own party, even policies she once enthusiastically promoted as signature features of her own previous campaigns. Pulling this off required some pretty adroit political gymnastics, where Harris had to completely reverse herself without showing the strain over long-held positions on fracking, immigration, asylum, a human rights-based foreign policy, student loan forgiveness, torture, the death penalty, and a single-payer health care system. But she sold these policy retreats so smoothly that the Democratic base eagerly embraced her joyful politics of austerity, aggressive policing and genocide with a smile. More

Early in the nineteenth century, Hegel, who never got to Italy, offered some evocative notes. Later in that century, Walter Pater published a famously suggestive account of the school of Giorgione. In 1970, Sydney J. Freedberg’s massive volume history of sixteenth-century Italian  More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First day back to work.
One of my self-sabotaging behavior is my occasional inability to set boundaries, specifically when it comes to my personal time and work.
I rarely take days off from work. I know that it’s a problem because I have maxed out my vacation accrual days (like now) during several occasions. When I do take the time off from work, I still check my messages in case there’s something on fire and I need to fix it. I also have my notifications on in the evenings, because some of my co-workers also don’t have boundaries when it comes to work, and will ping me because they too are working late.
I know, it’s bad.
This time around, very in line with my Do Not Disturb mentality, I decided to turn my Slack messages and work email notifications off during my time off.
It worked out so well. I mostly didn’t think about work. I didn’t see any messages that needed my attention right away. I didn’t have to think about the things I need to solve for my team during my time off. I had a clear separation of me enjoying my time off, and work that stresses me out more than it should.
Because of this, I decided to make this separation a little bit more permanent. I’m going to actually turn my (work) notifications off when it’s time to log off, so that I’m not unintentionally working during the evenings. We’ll see if this pans out.
Just the little things to get my mental health sorted out.

Working and studying simultaneously has its advantages—the first one is obvious: money. While academic life has its perks, financial gain isn’t usually one of them. Working while studying allowed me to make a living, plain and simple.

 It feels like two years ago but it was probably five. I drove from one side of North Carolina to another side of North Carolina because the “neo-confederates” were planning some kind of armed march through some small town and we needed all the numbers we could get to confront them. It worked, and we outnumbered them, and the people in town seemed grateful for our presence. 
 After a few hours, it devolved into a strange shouting match alongside a rural road. The confederates on one side of the road, the anti-fascists on the other. We probably called them Nazis. They called us communists.

Please introduce yourself to our readers
 My name is Kostya, I am a student of the second grade. [Kostya lives in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine.] 
How did you experience the beginning of the war?
 In fact, I sensed that a full-scale invasion would soon occur, but I did not expect it to be so large and destructive. I remember the beginning very well. My mother asked me to buy food, which was practically non-existent, and told me to stay at home. The first week was very scary, nobody knew what was going to happen. We were just hoping for the…]]></summary>

Title: Builders in Solidarity
Subtitle: A rambunctious Russian-speaking union shakes up Sweden’s labor movement
Date: August 16, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 28th August 2024 from meduza.io

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …]]></summary>

Today marks the first anniversary of your passing. Not a day goes... eeh, what’s that you said?
"I know, you don't have to rub it in."
Haha! Your sense of humor is intact. That's still one of the first things people mention when your name comes up: your wonderful sense of humor, and how incredibly kind you were.
You truly treated everyone with the same care and respect.
I still remember the incident in the garden from when I was little. A drug addict had wandered in and fallen asleep there. Mom and all of us kids stood at a safe distance, nervously watching as you helped him. Before staggering off, he turned around with tears of gratitude and asked:
"Are you a priest?"
That’s the kind of person you were. A helping hand and a life saver. A true hero.
As you know, your other son turns 50 today. But this day is not about birth or death. It’s a day of celebration and love. A day of unity, no matter the realm of residence.
Thank you for the long and wonderful time you gave us. Thank you for all the lovely memories that keep your spirit alive. Thank you for all the beautiful things you passed on to us.
I'll end with your last words:
I love you!]]></summary>

I’ve had a really good few days (since Friday) break. We did a lot in a relatively short amount of time.
So many indicators of a memorable time.
Tan lines in random places to indicate getting that much needed Vitamin D.
Photographs that froze time to be remembered and printed.
(Enamel) Pins added to my collection of places visited.
Stickers. All of the stickers, even though pins have replaced that obsession.
A couple of library cards to show that even during vacation, I still think about all of the books to be read in the future.
Memories of full bellies because we ate a lot of really yummy food.
I’m still processing everything. I’ll be posting all of the photos in the future, whether it be on here, or on the photoblog.
Last day of my very short “vacation” today.
I woke up this morning after having dreamt of work, with tears in my eyes. Is it respectable for me to throw a tantrum to show that I really don’t want to go back to work tomorrow?
Probably not. For today, I’m going to try really hard to just not think about it.
Vacation is not over until it’s over.

When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it's just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less as an adult. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn't unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven't heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library's entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with just one local library card. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I'm a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards = even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.

People in the first world take having fun very seriously. We sure spend enough money on it. Some kinds of fun are pricing themselves out of the middle-class range.

A day at a Disney theme park for a family of four is well over $1000.
I've never been to a Disney Park, and my last concert was 15 years ago. I guess I'll die without seeing Bruce Springsteen.

With that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A "challenge" where quality comes first – and only.
The idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your "best" during the month.
The post that...
...you are most proud of.
...was the hardest to write.
...is the most personal.
...best represents you.
...made you think in new ways.
Or whatever you base "best" on. Your favorite, simply put.
Why this challenge?
As a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.
If you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.
Please note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.

That's it.
That's the post.
A reflection post upcoming at some point, but not today.
Today, the plan is to bask in the sun, spend the day in one of the cutest towns, and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

...and of course, snapping photos of all of the things
