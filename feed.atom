        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's up?
You made it through the day. I'm proud of you. Seriously, I'm so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it's hard to look forward to anything when you're feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you'll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, "Someday I'll feel better. Someday I'll be alright." Remember, that "someday" comes one day at a time, and you'll get there. You will.
I'm proud of you. I'm very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blogging is back and today we have a myriad of great platforms to choose from. This one is hosted on Bear. If you have your own blog and are reading this, chances are that your blog is also a Bear one. 🐻
However, one of the things most of these “indie tools” lack is a search feature. I’ve written a separate post about it: The basic feature blogging platforms lack. 🔎
Well, it looks like things are about to change for us Bear bloggers. I just noticed that Herman's blog now has such a feature (can’t recall having seen it before). And it works elegantly. 🤩
Let's hope this is something we'll all have soon. Thank you in advance, Herman! ✌️
Update: Bear user Yordi made it possible to add your own (example). You can get yours here. Thank you, Yordi! 😎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whoops, they did it again. Only this time it was no “tragic mistake.” There were no apologies. Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.

I'm not used to it, like a river fish dumped in a tank. Everyone's dressed up in skin and mascara and waiting to go to the clubs and even though that life is not for me I love soaking in their anticipation on the subway platforms. Back when I worked abroad in that job I hated I remember writing something about how my soul left my body on Monday mornings and returned on Friday nights. I don't miss that feeling one bit, but I do sometimes think about that hunger for life I felt on Friday evenings, that burning desire to avenge the week of my life I sold to live for two days. If I could bottle that joie de vivre and down it everyday, I'd be unstoppable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It's so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels "less serious".
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don't worry so much about what people think of me. It's not that I don't care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I've come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can't please them all – and that's fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It's more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The neoliberal attack on government expenditure in poorer countries was a key driver of international migration. Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

But I am pointing out that while New York State court has jurisdiction over convicted felon Trump, the judge has both the right and the obligation—before issuing a sentence—to find out if the defendant has understood the charges that were brought against him. (From his endless press conferences during his trials, Trump sounds clueless about the facts in his own cases.) More

Corruption because the CIA under Mike “Get Assange” Pompeo plotted to kidnap or murder the journalist and also, corruptly, listened in on his privileged conversations with his attorney in the Ecuadoran embassy. Corruption because bogus charges were cooked up against him by a pliant Swedish prosecutor, the sole purpose of which was to toss Assange into the clutches of the furious U.S. government. Assange did not rape those two women in Sweden, and the prosecutor eventually dropped the case. But the damage was done: to Assange’s reputation and to his freedom, because once he sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy, he was trapped. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They're all pretty great!

it. There are close to 200 projects

I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don't get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!]]></summary>

It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana's AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane's brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and "pay-to-win" games (which use NFTs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything is dependent on feedback loops. Video games/reels have short exciting feedback loops. That is why they are so addictive. Real life often has long feedback loops. Anything you do, it will take time to see the results.
You will have to grind hard at something and for a sufficiently long amount of time to achieve something meaningful. Yet if your brain is trained to enjoy short feedback loops it becomes hard to do something for long without seeing exciting results.
You either train yourself to enjoy long feedback loops or you shorten the loop through regular rewards. Maybe break down the huge task into small chunks.
It is often good to run both a long and short feedback loop on a task. The long loop keeps you aware of the bigger picture so the setbacks don't seem as bad. The short loop keeps you on track and gives that constant nudge in the right direction.
You are already in a feedback loop whether you are aware of it or not. Better off being in a feedback loop that helps you grow. One of your own making.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.]]></summary>

It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…]]></summary>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.]]></summary>
