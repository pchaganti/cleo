A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife's edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump's 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple's ads for "Apple Intelligence" comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they're unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband's birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show; . The unprepared person is able to quickly "save the day" by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife's case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That's part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won't make us more perfect. The more we expect "perfection" from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.]]></summary>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the "aliveness" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label "life" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.
Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?
The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science.

According to the New York Times, internal polling showed that still undecided voters were "six times as likely as other battleground-state voters to be motivated by their views of Israel’s war in Gaza." Either the Harris campaign missed this lurking demographic or, more likely, just didn't care. Of course, Trump's still going to give Netanyahu the greenlight to burn Gaza, the West Bank and southern Lebanon to the ground and then target Iran. More

There was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.
All of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.
Then, in 2007, QNX went open source. You could even look at the microkernel. It wasn't openly licensed, but you could look inside and build it.
In 2010, RIM acquired QNX, and, with no warning, closed the source. All open source development related to QNX…]]></summary>

Yes, my glasses are taped because I'm still recovering from rhinoplasty and need to alleviate pressure off my nose.

For those who want to know:
20 sessions of laser + 4 sessions of electrolysis. Still slightly grey on upper and lower lip and continuing laser. I started Progesterone on month five instead of month six--and I shouldn't have. I was simply hurting too much and trying to rush the process. Cyproterone as T-blocker and patches for Estrogen. I'm not giving the amounts here because that's not what's important--it's your blood level concentration for T and E that you should be looking at.
Thinking I would at least like to be one cup bigger in breast growth!
Everyone tells me to imagine where I'll be in three years time and in all honesty, I don't even know where I'll be next year. I try not to think too far ahead now and just stay in the moment. :)
Ew-phoria moment: got checked out by a group of four men in a very uncomfortable way that made me run off. No thank you.
Weird moments: suddenly being asked out in the past two weeks and having crushes admitted to me by a few friends and I had to quickly and politely--but firmly--turn them down. Sorry, I'm very much taken.]]></summary>

I was wondering if you'd be willing to share your workflow for building products. At big companies, we'd usually do a lot of planning with diagrams, documentation, etc before building anything. I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when it comes to building a new products. Seeing how you've built some nice tools like Bear Blog, I wanted to hear from you personally.
I've built a lot of things over the past 10 years. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, with a few of them becoming actual products that fund the rest of my tinkering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember living in a different country as a child, hearing everyone talk about a faraway place called America.
Everyone wanted to go to America. The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.
Even as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.
America was the place to be. We would get freedom there.
That was a long time ago.
Now, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.
Today, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.
I am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).
I went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.
A lot will change over these next 4 years.
Be kind to your loved ones today.
Many of us need it.

I've been to college and the only thing it "educated" me in is Computer Science, which I majored in. I'm not in any way better as a human being than my friends working in construction. Quite the contrary, their job is far more important to society than mine. If I stopped my niche research tomorrow, no one would really care. If handymen, farmers, or truckers stopped working, there would be riots.
Also, the DNC should really stop forcing unwanted candidates down people's throats. It doesn't work, even when you spam social platforms with your narrative.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin
I tell myself that I blog for my own sake.
I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection.
I publish essays because it helps me tame my thinking.
And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.
I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats.
I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: expenses, books, movies, runs, etc.
Views and upvotes...
..just another metric to follow, a survey on whether anyone's reading.
A measure of... something I'm not sure anymore.
Writing has been my outlet, a habit I’ve had an on-off relationship with over the years.
In all my reasons for writing, I mostly write for myself.
I agree with Mr. Godin -- writing is clarifying, motivating and fun, even if no one's reading.
But I'll admit, it feels good knowing someone else is out there nodding along, connecting to a piece I've shared.
Imagining that somewhere, a stranger reads my words in their own quiet corner, maybe in pajamas, maybe over coffee, and smiles, resonates, or even feels a spark of recognition.
To me, that’s inspiring.
So, even if nobody reads my blog, the act of sharing still matters.
My writing is still deeply personal, a habit of expression and reflection.
And if, by chance, someone wanders in this corner of the web, that connection, however fleeting, is simply a bonus.]]></summary>

Shop talk and banter are fairly universal. Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn't look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not.
The other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics. In academia and in highbrow society the tendency is to basically sanitise every social interaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yet another Bear blog appreciation post.
I discovered Bear in 2023 through a Google search for minimal blogging platforms. Today, 379 days later, Bear has integrated into my routine.
I publish frequently without any pressure on the quality of my content. I write about whatever random things come to mind.
I programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman's product garden, I'm happy to support the platform.
I also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.
On rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.
Beyond writing, I've become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent > Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It's become a habit I look forward to.
After a year, Bear still feels like a great fit. Herman has created the perfect blogging experience that feels fluid with my digital habits.]]></summary>

If you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.
I have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.
Yes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it's usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).
Yes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).
Yes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it's something you need with a remote env anyways.
---
The only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I'm my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn't your source code in 99.5% of cases, it's the team that executes that source code in production.
If you're in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I've worked in those too...)]]></summary>
