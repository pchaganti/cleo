        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a "behind-the-scenes" look at my development of a cool sensor during my PhD (electrical engineering). This sensor is only about 1/3 of my total research for my degree and took about a year.
I've been on HN for a while now and I've seen my fair share of posts about the woes of pursuing a PhD. Now that I'm done with mine I wanna share some anecdotal evidence that doing a PhD can actually be enjoyable (not necessarily easy) and also be doable in 3 years.
When I started I knew I didn't want to work on something that would never leave the lab or languish in a dissertation PDF no one will ever read. Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.
Looking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you've figured them out!
Oh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you'll see -- it's such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This reminds me of how GPT-2/3/J came across https://reddit.com/r/counting, wherein redditors repeatedly post incremental numbers to count to infinity. It considered their usernames, like SolidGoldMagikarp, such common strings on the Internet that, during tokenization, it treated them as top-level tokens of their own.
https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8viQEp8KBg2QSW4Yc/solid...
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LAxAmooK4uDfWmbep/anomalous-...
Vocabulary isn't infinite, and GPT-3 reportedly had only 50,257 distinct tokens in its vocabulary. It does make me wonder - it's certainly not a linear relationship, but given the number of inferences run every day on GPT-3 while it was the flagship model, the incremental electricity cost of these Redditors' niche hobby, vs. having allocated those slots in the vocabulary to actually common substrings in real-world text and thus reducing average input token count, might have been measurable.
It would be hilarious if the subtitle on OP's site, "IECC ChurnWare 0.3," became a token in GPT-5 :)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first patent was issued in the 1400's — it is exactly how humans have progressed technologically and sociality. Let's stop being so absolutist about these topics.
The problem here isn't that patents exist, intellectual property protection is critical to investment and research. The issue here is two fold:
1. Patents usually involve a lot of research — and existed as a way to ensure that competition couldn't imitate your product without also making that investment, licensing it from you, etc. If there was no protection, they would immediately undercut you since they don't have investment costs to cover. Tech patents, however, are so broad and require so little actual material science that the "protect the investment" part doesn't add up.
2. Patent offices couldn't keep up with the rapid rate of technical advancement and may have granted overly-broad patents for what we would now consider rather general topics. The only effective way to invalidate these patents is expensive and lengthy court proceedings — which is fair, if you think about it, you wouldn't want your rights taken away without a defence. But when weaponised, it can count-intuitively stifle the innovation it was trying to protect.
What we need is a better criteria and definition of IP which better suits modern industry.]]></summary>

Now, it is debatable whether the ecosystem is ready to be doing this at (some) scale by default. I agree it's not, dealing with e2e encrypted email is a less convenient experience than plaintext for most users. But not all - case on point, with Proton it's fine.
It's a valid question how opt in our out should work, with lots of implications and stakeholders involved. For better or worse, the status quo is that there is no signaling mechanism in openpgp (or keys.openpgp.org) at the moment to specify how a key should be used, so publishing a key is just a yes or no situation.
If op wants to offer encrypted email as a possible means of communication, but explicitly on an opt in basis, I would recommend a separate email address (or a tag, e.g. +encrypt) for that purpose.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My partner had a concussion many years ago, it was an eye-opening experience.
After months of mostly-useless conversations with doctors, neurologists, etc, we visited a sports medicine specialist who worked with snowboarders, skiers, etc, people who get concussions frequently.
The way the specialist described common concussion symptoms was really interesting: Effectively, your brain finds balance by using a combination of sight, touch (feet), and your inner ear. A concussion can impact the inner ear part of that equation, so your brain is overly reliant on sight and touch to compensate. This can cause all kinds of common concussion symptoms: Dizziness, sensitivity to screen time, etc.
Anyways, after giving us the rundown my partner was prompted to do a few simple exercises to test concussion symptoms. One of them was to stand on one leg and track a moving pen with her eyes. She'd done OK on some of the previous exercises but this one took her out, she lasted maybe 5 seconds and was completely exhausted and dizzy for the rest of the day because of it.
We ended up with a physical-therapy-like balance exercise plan that she stuck to regularly for a few months, and it ended up getting her to complete recovery.]]></summary>

To quote the eBook Reader Blog [1]:
> The main drawback with color E Ink screens is they look darker than regular B&W screens because of a color filter layer that is applied over the top of the screen, which makes the contrast appear lower. Kaleido color screens are really just regular black and white E Ink Carta screens with a fancy passive filter over the top (that’s why color resolution is lower than black and white resolution).

So if Alice buys book from Bob, four entries are made.

That's where social media has been most damaging. You can't share your thoughts anymore. The 'Redditization' of the world means that sharing thoughts is met with hostility. No longer can you just throw something out there, no matter how stupid. These days you have carry an entire encyclopedia with you in order to back up every last thing you say and if you utter anything that isn't deemed 100% perfect by those listening, the social scorn will fall upon you.
> It's bizarre.
Is it, though? Once you've felt said social scorn enough you no longer see words as a way to make friends, so turning to beauty is the natural progression. People like to be around beautiful people – or at least so it appears to those looking from the outside in, right? If that doesn't work, then you can easily fall into a cycle of thinking "maybe this next surgery is the one that will make me beautiful enough!"]]></summary>

She does this and all the while never leaves the house, other than to go to work. She doesn't share her actual thoughts and gets angry when asked about it. You might be reading this and thinking that there's more to it, but sadly there isn't. It's her life so I leave her alone, not my place to tell her what to do, and the emotional upheaval from her isn't worth it either.
But it's crazy that a person can get this lost in life and become completely devoid of purpose and meaning. It's one thing to have an issue and work through it slowly, but it's something else to isolate yourself and live your life through others - while those "others" prosper from your own ignorance.
I'm sure her past experiences are playing a role in this behavior, but the whole cosmetics things - I know for a fact there are a lot of influencers who peddle this crap, and if you lack self-awareness then I can see how easy it is to get stuck in this cycle.

It's really not that simple. The products have become so widespread and influential that they change the very culture of our society for the worse. It doesn't matter whether you abstain from using Instagram or not, some of your friends will still be more or less subtly influenced by its existence in your social interactions.
There's a nice quote from Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, which IMO hasn't aged at all in 60 years: "Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the 'content' of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind... The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance."]]></summary>

Kids are really good at identifying hypocrisy. When they see their parents glued to their phones and scrolling Instagram all day, after being told "Oh, don't do that, it's not good for you" they know their parents are full of shit.
And, the trouble is: Most of these adults are addicted to their smartphones and social media, too. Everyone is. I go to birthday parties with my kid, and sporting events, indoors and outdoors, and other kid activities, and the kids are for the most part jumping around having a ball, while the adults are huddled up by themselves, bathed in smartphone light, scrolling through their feeds getting their fix.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel so bad for teenagers/kids who we essentially screwed over with this tech experience. That said, I don't feel great for the rest of us either! I feel like my phone has become a significant negative in my life. And in general, I'm quite scared because we have put things in place that we know are bad for mental health:
1. Even if we may not like it all the time, there is tons of data that show that personal interactions and relationships are good for mental health. With so much technology and so many things going remote (I'm not just talking jobs, but I'm talking about the fact that it's very easy, for example, to never need to walk into a store anymore. I recently went to a fast food restaurant and there were no customers inside at lunchtime, normally a busy time, and I ordered on a kiosk and everyone else just ordered at the drivethrough) it's harder and harder to just see random people and our friends without explicit planning.
2. As someone who recently got over a severe episode of depression, I strongly believe time spent in nature and just outside in general is really good for the mental health of humans. With so much tech it's easier and easier to basically never go outside unless you make it a point to do so.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazed at the amount of people here who would clearly be against seatbelts if they were to be made a legal requirement today. So many people are certain it won't happen to them. Accidents happen, even to experts.
My dad had a table saw he'd been using for over a decade when he had an accident. Luckily they were able to stitch up the finger and he missed the bone, allowing the finger tip to regrow. But my family friend who's a professional carpenter isn't as lucky and is missing the tips of three fingers from a jointer.
These tools are dangerous and table saws cause upwards of 30k injures a year. Everyone's talking about how this will kill the industry. Are businesses not innovative around costs, new technology, and regulations? Seems like everything from cars to energy have all improved with regulatory pressure
And to all the people saying this will keep hobbyists away. Ever think of how many more people would be willing to buy a table saw if they knew they weren't going to cut their fingers off?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key point here is the SawStop CEO is promising to open up the patent and make it available for anyone, so it's a bit more complicated than the typical regulatory-capture lawyer success story.
The 3-point seat belt is another time this happened and probably one of the few feel-good "this should be available to everyone" patent stories: Volvo designed it, decided the safety-for-humanity* benefits outweighed patent protections, and made the patent open for anyone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Bohlin (*: at least the segment of humanity that drives cars)
I'd be curious to hear the cynical take here. If I was to wargame it, I would guess something like: SawStop doesn't want to compete with Harbor Freight and cheap chinese tool manufacturers -- that's a race to the bottom, and power tools have turned into ecosystem lock-in plays which makes it difficult for a niche manufacturer to win in. So they'd rather compete on just the safety mechanism since they have a decade head start on it. They're too niche to succeed on SawStop(TM) workbenches, and they forsee bigger profits in a "[DeWalt|Milwaukee|EGo|...], Protected by SawStop(TM)" world.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The defensiveness has absolutely nothing to do with better computers and the improvements in play that came with it, but with tournaments where risk taking is an economic disaster. As others have said, there aren't massive numbers of ties in the candidates tournament, because the difference in value between being first and second is so massive that if you aren't first, you are last.
Compare this to regular high level chess in the Grand Chess Tour: It's where most of your money is going to come from if you are a top player. Invitation to the tour as a regular is by rating, and there's enough money at the bottom of the tour than the difference between qualifying or not is massive. Therefore, the most important thing is to stay in the tour train. Lose 20 points of rating, and barring Rex Sinquefield deciding to sponsor your life out of the goodness of his heart, you might as well spend time coaching, because there are so few tournaments where there's a lot of money.
This also shows in the big difficulties for youngsters that reach 2650 or so: They are only going to find good enough opponents to move up quickly in a handful of events a year where people with higher rating end up risking their rating against them. See how something like the US championship is a big risk for the top US professionals, because all the young players that show are at least 50 points underrated, if not more.
This is what causes draws, not computer prep. Anand was better at just drawing every game in every tournament back when he was still on the tour, and yet computers were far worse than today, especially with opening theory.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just look to Chess. The top players today are way better than any of the greats before, because they can train against computers and know exactly where they failed. That said, because they've gotten so good, chess at the top levels is pretty boring... it's hard to come up with a unique strategy so players tend to be defensive. Lots of ties.
On the other hand, chess is more popular than ever. It's huge in high schools. I see people playing it everywhere. I know that for me, I love being able to play a game and then view the computer analysis afterwards and see exactly what I did wrong (granted, sometimes a move can be good for a computer who will know how to follow through on the next 10 moves, but not necessarily good for me... but most of the time I can see where I made a mistake when the computer points it out).
Side note: I play on LIChess and it's great. Is there an equivalent app for Go?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.]]></summary>

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.

The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.

At Ænix, we have a deep affection for Kubernetes and dream that all modern technologies will soon
start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.

Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.]]></summary>

Since Windows support graduated to stable

appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.]]></summary>
