Iran previously threatened that if Israel hit their nuclear program, they would hit Israel’s nuclear sites in retaliation.
Iran’s leadership are incompetent. That statement will enrage some readers and commenters, but they have allowed their allies to be taken out one by one, they have not yet launched significant retaliation, and their current actions, sending a hundred drones to attack Israel, are pathetic. It is no favor to them to pretend their strategy is working: it is clearly failing.

Non-violent protest has been the dogma, especially on the center-left, for generations now. It wasn’t always thus: old time unions fought pitched battles with police and in one case coal miners fought the military straight up. Blowing up buildings was not verboten, nor was assassination. The history of America is not what pansy-moderns think it is, and the same is true of Britain and Canada and so on. Our forbears did not think that letting the state beat you, shoot you, torture you, imprison you and kill you without fighting back was either virtuous or, in many cases, smart.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the war started, I predicted that Russia would win militarily. That was an easy, obvious prediction based on the fact that Russia is larger and has more industry and that China would not allow sanctions to take out Russia, knowing it would be next, but would keep the Russian economy running.
This prediction is a little more risky because the war could end due to a peace deal. There’s no question that Ukraine is losing, and that the battlefield is getting worse and worse for them.

Russian forced are back within 300 kilometers of Kiev. While advances are slow, they are speeding up. The Ukrainians are running out of manpower, considering mobilizing women for infantry, and have huge problems with desertion and recruitment. Russia has ramped up weapon production far more than the West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a lot of people don’t know is that the aid ship Greta was on wasn’t the first ship sent. The last one didn’t get to Israel either, but since there were no major celebrities on it, most people who aren’t 24/7 news or Gaza obsessives don’t know it even existed.
This aid ship was never expected to be able to deliver food and medical supplies. Everyone knew Israel would stop it. It was meant to highlight the fact that Israel is has created a deliberate famine in Gaza.
Because Greta, in particular, was there, it succeeded. That was her job. She wasn’t required to die, or to wind up in prison, though both were possible, she’s just a lightning rod. I’ve seen at least half a dozen op-eds, most of them negative, about Greta and the relief ship.
But negative is fine. Neolibs and right wingers love to hate Greta. They can’t shut up and not talk about her, which is what they should have done. Instead they have to take their potshots, and so far more people know that a ship full of food was hijacked in international waters and that Israel is starving Palestinians to death.
Celebrities, and Greta is a celebrity, have one main job when it comes to whatever causes they champion: to get press. That’s what Greta did and good for her.
As for all the haters, well, Greta’s right that genocide is bad, and she’s right about the environment, so hating her most likely means someone wants mass death, or that they’re stupid and think environmental issues aren’t real.

So, there were protests in L.A. over Trump’s immigrant removal strategy, some turned violent and Trump is calling in the National Guard and talking about using the military.
It’s worth pointing out that Trump has deported less undocumented immigrants than Biden did over comparable periods. This isn’t about deportation, as such.
What it is about is Gestapo tactics: sending people to torture prisons without due process; wearing masks and refusing to show badges or warrants; giving ICE the right to create its own warrants without judicial oversight (clearly unconstitutional); seizing people who are showing up for meetings at immigration facilities or immigrant courts.
