Disclaimer: I am not a fan of gambling. I do not condone it. I do not recommend it. In fact, I believe online gambling and sports betting will irrevocably damage entire generations. I was terribly addicted and it really gave me bad thoughts all the time. Do not, do not gamble.
With that being said, I used to gamble, a lot. I started really young: when I was 11. It began innocuously with Team Fortress 2, betting in-game currencies like refined metals in raffle groups for larger prizes. I was on the edge of my seat for pennies. I never told my parents (hint: my family was poor). While this wasn't particularly profitable, it was my introduction to the habit.

The only way to get Bernie Sanders’ “good friend” “Genocide Joe” Biden to give up his delegates and allow them to go to someone with (perhaps) a better shot at beating Adolph Trump (the man Trump’s 2024 vice presidential running mate JD Vance called “America’s Hitler” in 2016) was to praise the incumbent as “a man of great integrity with a long and noble record of service to America and humanity including his heroic defeat of Trump in the 2020 election.” More

For example, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg donated $20 milliontoward efforts to reelect Biden this year alone. Four years ago, Bloomberg spent a whopping $1 billion in just four months in an attempt to be the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. In a testament to the fact that we have a modicum of democratic accountability left within the system as it stands, he failed spectacularly, as others have often done. Voters seem to have a distaste for electing the ultra-rich but have yet to disavow the de facto proxies that their money helps elect. More

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson took the lead in extending the invitation last March.  With the participation of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it soon became a bipartisan invitation. This won't be the first time an Israeli leader has used an address to Congress to strengthen Israel's already powerful relations with America.  In 2015 Netanyahu bypassed the White House to deliver an address that attacked U.S participation in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations.  Although the Prime Minister's visit deeply embarrassed then President Obama, a year later he overlooked the slight to commit $38 billion in arms aid to Israel over ten-years.    More

I've been a professional designer since 2006, and I got over that thinking pretty quickly. A designer trying to be strikingly original is rarely acting in service of the design. If you want to be strikingly original, you probably want to be an artist instead of a designer. What a designer fundamentally does is communicate the best solution to a problem, given the requirements, goals, and constraints of that problem. Originality is subordinate to that at best.]]></summary>

I have two main blogs: Notes by JCProbably (this one) and JEDDACP.ME (still yet to be named).

On the other hand, JEDDACP.ME is primarily where I post photos, with some random context about the photos, or the location where the photo was snapped.
I wish I could combine both spaces into one so that I am able to consolidate and just focus on one blog. However, the separation of both spaces is intentional.
JEDDACP.ME is the website that I freely give to others. It exists for me to showcase photos I’ve taken, and serves as an informal, photographic guide to places I’ve been. If I have friends visi…]]></summary>

The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can't say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…]]></summary>

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It's citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers' losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).

- it'd be distracting, they're open source devs/maintainers not fund managers
- it could be divisive and they'd risk taking flak if they get it "wrong"
- it creates a class of "approved" clients and related projects
I think the Jellyfin team's approach is pretty reasonable.
That said, if I was them I'd probably do what the Helix devs do [0] and rather than telling people to stop donating, remind them that donations are a "tip" to the project and shouldn't be assumed to be buying you anything or paying to ramp up development (or marketing or anything else). I really appreciate that stance and their attitude that it's great to have the money and they'll spend it if and when they need it, while also encouraging people to consider donating elsewhere if they want to have a bigger impact.

It says that China “has become a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine.” The term “decisive enabler” has attracted significant attention within China, where the government immediately condemned NATO’s characterization of the war in Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that NATO’s statement “is ill-motivated and makes no sense.” Shortly after Russian troops entered Ukraine, China’s Wang Wenbin of the Foreign Ministry said that “all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and upheld.” This is precisely the opposite of cheerleading for the war.

 It was the early spring of 2017, and I stood in line for the daily school routine. We did the usual routine of standing up for the Palestinian anthem and the obligatory start-of-the-week fingernail check. The inspector will hit your hands with a wooden stick if you do not cut your fingernails every week. After the morning routine, we saw our sports teacher make an announcement:

The failure of Israel’s two most important allies, the US and UK, to put an end to the slaughter of the civilian population in Gaza in 2023-2024 and the American and British mainstream media’s refusal to contextualize the 7 October attack raises questions about their status as democratic states. What many independent journalists and academics have described as Israel’s genocidal policy in Gaza has a parallel in America’s “Indian removal” policies in the 19th century and British colonialism in India, where violent imperial rule brought about tens of millions of excess deaths between 1880 and 1920 (Sullivan & Hickel, 2022). The racist underpinnings of settler colonialism have thus been present in Western, specifically Judeo-Christian, political culture since Europeans first explored continents beyond their own. Modern day Zionism is a retrograde form of colonialism and imperialism that is rooted in 19th-century nationalist, militarist, capital-expansionist, and racist practices and outlooks of Western Europe from which it sprung.

American Jew here, who spent years living in France and Spain. I've heard the same polite euphemisms refering to Arabs and Gypsies from the mouths of members of the Front National. You know, before 1945 it was said in Europe that Jews weren't able to integrate fully with the host society.
One might ask: Was that the Jews' fault? Or the host society's fault?
It's a relevant question. You are blaming it on the particular group of migrants involved in the case of Europe right now. But historically Europe has ghettoized other groups.
When the US ghettoized Chinese economic migrants, American politicians claimed they could never integrate. And yet the Chinese-American population is well integrated and hugely successful since the host society allowed it. Same with Jews in America, and increasingly with Hispanics.
Why is it that economic migrants do, after a few generations, become successfully integrated in America, while they tend not to in Europe?
I don't think the evidence definitively supports the conclusion that it's down to which group. Europe has a problem with integration that has its roots in the ethnic character of its states (something America does not have), in deep-seated xenophobia that causes social exclusion of immigrant or out-groups, and in the fact that its states' reasons for existence are based on tribal boundaries and wars for territory rather than on achieving broader democratic and economic flourishing by harnessing the capability of the whole population. And thus Europe presents neither a dream of integration nor a path toward integration (as in, "to become American"; there is neither an equivalent aspiration nor option "to become French"). And then, once again, Europe blames the groups it refuses to accept.]]></summary>

History and data from various European nations suggest that some immigrant groups aren't able to integrate with the host society after multiple generations, and remain ghettoized with low employment and high crime rates (vastly higher than the native population, for certain categories of crime).
It's clear that the national interest is in accepting skilled immigrants who migrate legally and are able to integrate fully into the host society, a la Teddy Roosevelt's dropping of the hyphen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It's a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.
Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let's call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There's more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it's completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.

The International Court of Justice has made definitive what has been obvious for decades: It’s about the apartheid, stupid. In a sweeping ruling announced on Friday at the Hague, the Court ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories violates international law and should be ended. It determined that the occupation amounts to “annexation” of Palestinian lands and that all Israeli settlements should be evacuated and the land returned to Palestinians. It said that all Palestinians who had been forced into exile should be granted the right to return and that Israel must pay them reparations for its destructive actions. The court described Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories as a form of racial segregation and apartheid and called for the dismantling of the apartheid wall, checkpoints and other barriers to travel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better satellites and other aerial survey data has determined that oil and gas  related methane emissions are far, far higher than industry reports.  Everywhere independent researchers look along the production, transmission, distribution and end use pipeline they find more leakage than has been assumed because industry has provided the numbers the assumptions are based on for years.
Along some particularly leaky production paths methane emissions are so great that the impact is greater than coal over 100 year timescale.  For example, some parts of NM Permian have a 9% (!) leakage rate.  When combusted methane releases about half the amount of CO2 that coal does.  The eGHG potential of methane is 20x CO2 over 100 year timescale, so you have to add 180% to the total GHG potential, making it 40% worse than coal w/o even considering other leakage along the pipeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context: Students are protesting to reform the quota system. Which was abolished in 2018 after protest but recently brought back again. The Quota system basically reserves 56% of public sector jobs, i.e. 30% to relatives of war veteran.
The war happened in 1971. To get public job and avail the quota, it must be their 3rd or 4th generation now. Which is plain unfair.
But it’s not about that, the gov loyalists and their goons fake these veteran certificates to land these jobs. Bangladesh is one of the most corrupted countries in the world after all. So real veteran relatives are seldom the beneficiary.
These students just wanted to reform this system. But our fascist gov and their goons used force and killed 50+ unarmed students until yesterday (3 from my alma mater alone.) This was completely unprovoked and unnecessary. Basically any forms of dissent have been dealt with this way since 2009. No one can criticize or protest the big brother.
We have a dictatorship since 2009. People are angry - due to corruption, inflation, joblessness and tyranny. This is just some outburst of it.
When you see the videos how the police are killing teenagers and university students in the road - our future generation - no one can tolerate this.
Now the fascist gov has closed all internet and phone connection to outside world. I can't contact my family anymore. I don't know their well being.
There is of course more to it. But this is the summary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, this hits close to home. Doing a page fault where you can't in the kernel is exactly what I did with my very first patch I submitted after I joined the Microsoft BitLocker team in 2009. I added a check on the driver initialization path and didn't annotate the code as non-paged because frankly I didn't know at the time that the Windows kernel was paged. All my kernel development experience up to that point was with Linux, which isn't paged.
BitLocker is a storage driver, so that code turned into a circular dependency. The attempt to page in the code resulted a call to that not-yet-paged-in code.
The reason I didn't catch it with local testing was because I never tried rebooting with BitLocker enabled on my dev box when I was working on that code. For everyone on the team that did have BitLocker enabled they got the BSOD when they rebooted. Even then the "blast radius" was only the BitLocker team with about 8 devs, since local changes were qualified at the team level before they were merged up the chain.
The controls in place not only protected Windows more generally, but they even protected the majority of the Windows development group. It blows my mind that a kernel driver with the level of proliferation in industry could make it out the door apparently without even the most basic level of qualification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowdstrike did this to our production linux fleet back on April 19th, and I've been dying to rant about it.
The short version was: we're a civic tech lab, so we have a bunch of different production websites made at different times on different infrastructure. We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.
When we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.
Crowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- "we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise. What they're selling to the enterprise is exactly that they'll do that.]]></summary>

It's easy to blame CrowdStrike but that seems too easy on both the orgs that do this but also the upstream forces that compel them to do it.
My org which does mission critical healthcare just deployed ZScaler on every computer which is now in the critical path of every computer starting up and then in the critical path of every network connection the computer makes. The risk of ZScaler being a central point of failure is not considered. But - the risk of failing the compliance checkbox it satisfies is paramount.
All over the place I'm seeing checkbox compliance being prioritised above actual real risks from how the compliance is implemented. Orgs are doing this because they are more scared of failing an audit than they are of the consequences failure of the underlying systems the audits are supposed to be protecting. So we need to hold regulatory bodies accountable as well - when they frame regulation such that organisations are cornered into this they get to be part of the culpability here too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwaway account...
CrowdStrike in this context is a NT kernel loadable module (a .sys file) which does syscall level interception and logs then to a separate process on the machine. It can also STOP syscalls from working if they are trying to connect out to other nodes and accessing files they shouldn't be (using some drunk ass heuristics).
What happened here was they pushed a new kernel driver out to every client without authorization to fix an issue with slowness and latency that was in the previous Falcon sensor product. They have a staging system which is supposed to give clients control over this but they pissed over everyone's staging and rules and just pushed this to production.
This has taken us out and we have 30 people currently doing recovery and DR. Most of our nodes are boot looping with blue screens which in the cloud is not something you can just hit F8 and remove the driver. We have to literally take each node down, attach the disk to a working node, delete the .sys file and bring it up. Either that or bring up a new node entirely from a snapshot.
This is fine but EC2 is rammed with people doing this now so it's taking forever. Storage latency is through the roof.
I fought for months to keep this shit out of production because of this reason. I am now busy but vindicated.
Edit: to all the people moaning about windows, we've had no problems with Windows. This is not a windows issue. This is a third party security vendor shitting in the kernel.]]></summary>

There was just a dime’s worth of difference between them as far as he was concerned.

But as with any growing community, this hasn't been without its own set of challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorised into 2 groups:
1. Spam blogs
Fighting spam is an ongoing battle, but mostly a solved problem. A combination of The Frustration Loop and the review process has taken care of it. However, due to a sharp increase in the number of signups recently (both legitimate and spam blogs), I've co-opted the help of Pam and Shraddha from Bonsai Digital to get through the never-ending stack of new blogs.

-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don't read them. I'm a collector of nightstand-books.
-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I'm in love.
-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.
-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you're shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you're wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it's like I'm afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.
-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).
-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don't know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.]]></summary>

poor, depressed artist aesthetic, after which I would be discovered and prove everyone wrong about not chasing your dreams. My peers would see me on TV and gawk. Grand finale: let the curtain fall; everyone applauds.
I'm happy to say none of that came true.
The truth is, your 20s are a little bit of a bitch. These are the years someone can either be going steady with a child on each hip or they can be partying 'til the sun goes down. Comparison is hard to keep at bay since everyone is going at a different pace and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.]]></summary>

Introduction
TO BEGIN...
 “We recognize that the feminist camp has made great efforts, by revealing the mechanisms that oppress women and dissidence, and by naming issues that used to be invisible. However, this does not mean that the concepts and categories, and therefore the theoretical frameworks, are all equally valid. As especifist anarchists we task ourselves with taking from these theoretical productions, the concepts and categories that are consistent with our own ideology. Referring to the guiding principles of other currents will not only lead us down a different ideological path but also have concrete effects on the militancy, on the political level as on the …]]></summary>

I.
 It was Autumn. A carriage and a calesche were proceeding at a sharp trot along the high-road. In the carriage sat two women. One of them was the mistress, thin and pale. The other was the maid, smug, florid, and buxom. Her short dry tresses peeped forth from under her faded bonnet, her pretty hand in her torn glove readjusted them from time to time; her swelling bosom, covered by a rug, was full of the breath of health; her quick black eyes glanced at one moment out of the window at the scurrying fields, at another stared boldly at her mistress, or glanced uneasily at the corners of the carriage.
