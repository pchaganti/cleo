And, it’s worth pointing out that the Conservatives increased their seat count, which is why Poilievre is sticking around as leader, despite losing the election and his own seat.

The left-center NDP is being slaughtered and seems likely to lose its official party status.
Five months ago I would have said, and did say, that the Conservatives would form the next government, with Poilievre (a Trump figure) as Prime Minister.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economics is largely a worthless discipline. Its axioms, like humans being rational utility maximizers, are simply wrong and everything built on top of them is thus flawed. It reminds me of pre-Copernican astronomy, which was based on the idea that the sun and planets revolved around the Earth. The difference is that pre-Copernican astronomy more or less worked and economics mostly doesn’t.
But there are insights in economics, and there’s a cluster around free, or rather, competitive markets. In order for competitive markets to work:
There must be lots of buyers and sellers, so no one has pricing or buying power.
There must be no significant barriers to entry. If you can’t start a new business doing whatever it is, market incumbents can jack up prices. Barriers to entry are both legal and …]]></summary>

Officials Prepared to Return Abrego Garcia—Until Trump Intervened
Malcolm Ferguson, April 25, 2025 [The New Republic]
Some officials in the Trump administration tried to bring back Kilmar Abregoa Garcia just days after he was deported, but the president shut them down.
Since Abrego Garcia was unlawfully deported last month due to an administrative error, the White House has vehemently maintained that it will not try to return him to the United States. But a report in The Atlantic Friday revealed that in the days after Abrego Garcia’s deportation…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We live in a weird time: the accusation of anti-semitism has never been more common and the consequences have never been more severe, but the accusation has never been more likely to be a compliment.
In most cases today, if someone is accused of anti-semitism, they are being accused of being against genocide. Against the mass murder of ci civilians. Against children being deliberately shot in the head and against prisoners being raped to death
To be sure, real anti-semites exist, but if someone hasn’t been accused to anti-semitism, one knows they have no ethics and are either a wimp, unwilling to even say “genocide is bad” or an evil person who thinks genocide is good.
On the other hand the phrase “pro Israel” means “supporter of mass murder, the deliberate killing of children, and of raping people to death.” If someone describes themselves as pro-Israel they are evil, they have condemned themselves out of their own mouths and no decent person will have anything to do with unless coerced.
The irony, of course, is that by wrapping themselves in Judaism Israel has made the charge of anti-semitism bear no moral weight and has increased real anti-semitism, as many people no longer take the care to distinguish between Zionism and Judaism. This is unfair to the many Jews (almost all outside of Israel, Israel is in the running for sickest society in history) who have opposed Israel’s genocide.
If you ever asked yourself “what would I have done were I alive during the Holocaust and aware of it?”, well, the answer is “whatever you’re doing right now.”
Your soul has been weighed, and many should pray it does not fall under Ma’at’s gaze.

The difference this time would be that the US was leading the weaker block, not the stronger.
Trump has made this very unlikely. His tariffs and threats have broken the unanimity of the alliance and vassal circle. The EU is in China right now seeking to cut a trade deal with the possible of end of many sanctions on the table. Canada’s presumptive PM has said the old order is dead. When China cut off US LNG who stepped into the gap? Australia and Canada. Even Japan, the most loyal of vassals, has noted that you can’t make a deal with Trump, because blackmailers always come back for more.
