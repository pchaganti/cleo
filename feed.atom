I embody those same sentiments.
A lot of my friends and family don’t know I blog or make zines. This breaks my heart because I consider these creative pursuits a big part of my life. It’s what I spend the most time thinking about.
Only recently have I nonchalantly told my bf about my website and zine making. It felt like a big deal sharing that information bc I'm such a private person, but I don't think he's checked it out yet.

It's been seven months since I started my weekly email letters, and I've put so much work into these missives.
I've asked people to financially support my email letters, but unfortunately, it's not panning out, and I'm unsure how to move forward.
Working towards something without moving the needle doesn't feel good.
It sucks to admit failure, and it sucks that it's not working out. Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn't enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.
Much self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making. When my efforts prove financially unsuccessful, it feels like a direct hit to my purpose/aim in life, which is a terrible feeling to reconcile. I have no idea how to untangle this.
Do I hit delete on my online efforts/website and write anonymously somewhere else? Perhaps.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I've been thinking about this for a while but couldn't gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn't work long-term. You don't smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you're never free from the thought "I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now." That's why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn't help me), or some other activity where you don't think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it's simply a fact I didn't want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that's it. I don't see anything wrong with games if they don't interfere with main tasks and don't cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people's blogs. Until recently, I didn't even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people's posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I'm very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it's much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Film critic Pauline Kael, the epitome of New York sophistication, is often misquoted as having said that she didn’t know anyone who had voted for Nixon. Which is pretty funny. What she in fact said was that she knew “only one person who voted for Nixon,” that the rest of them were “outside my ken,” and that she could feel their presence only sometimes “when I’m in a theater.” Which is no longer funny, just irritating. Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York. Yet, as the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in her new book, the well-publicized contempt of the elites for those they consider “hillbillies” or “rednecks” significantly contributes to our current political malaise.

Settlers have killed an additional 21 Palestinians. There have been more than 3,500 attacks and incidents from settlers, many of them beatings and burnings of agriculture and homes. American-supplied Israeli rifles and bombs have wounded more than 5,000 Palestinians in the last 13 ½ months. Notably, there have been more than 100 airstrikes; airstrikes had not happened in the West Bank in more than 20 years. 18 of the 168 killed by Israeli warplanes and drones have been children. Before October 7th, the Israeli military gunned down and killed, on average, more than one Palestinian a day. In the first ten months of 2023, Israeli soldiers murdered nearly 50 children in the West Bank. Yet, many in the US believe history started on October 7th, 2023. More

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it's not my place to change anyone's personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children's worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that's idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can't help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won't.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I wrote about needing to quit social media again, and I was debating internally even more after that. I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam's post about social media, and it clicked for me.
I deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.
What I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I've grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I've had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.
Now that I'm unshackled again, I'm making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I'm tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I'm doing the same for other people.]]></summary>

Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with "driver impairment" tech which was called a "kill switch". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just "sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements" and "block the driver from operating the vehicle". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497
Anyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I'll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Code reviews are supposed to be about improving code quality and sharing knowledge, but when PR comments start hitting the hundreds, something is very wrong. I’ve recently come across a discussion where a new developer joined a team and faced over 300 PR comments on their first contribution. Most of it was stylistic nitpicking. This isn’t just unproductive, it’s outright toxic.
Why This Happens
You’re Not Using Linters or Auto-Formatters
Prettier, ESLint, or Black exist for a reason. Not automating this is borderline malpractice in modern development.
Your Team Has a "Style Over Substance" Obsession
Metrics Gone Wild
Toxic Culture
What Needs to Change
Automate the Trivial Stuff
Focus on What Matters
Define (and Stick To) a Style Guide
Measure the Right Things
Stop Wasting Everyone’s Time
Hundreds of comments on a PR are a red flag, not a badge of honor. It means your process is broken. Fix the culture, fix the tooling, and focus on what actually matters: shipping high-quality, maintainable software. Anything else is just noise.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.
After moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple "hello" while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.
And wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.
For now, I’m enjoying my role as a "hello-er" and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a "hello-er" could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.]]></summary>

Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink's anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom. More

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.
Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying "FBO" accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer's balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse's case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I'm willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.
FWIW, after seeing "how the sausage is made", I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.

PyTorch’s Autograd feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as gradients) over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.

> All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]
> So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.

此文就是记录从我调研到购买和使用的一系列功课的汇总，如果你也桌备购入，希望能够帮助到你。
购前
🤔 如果你要使用 Apple TV 就意味着……
在中国大陆地区，想要使用 Apple TV 还是需要一些技巧的，这里作为前提先列出来：
一个 Apple ID（为了体验最大化，并不推荐使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID）；
一台电视或一台显示器；
流畅的网络环境（为了体验最大化，最好是比较科学的网络条件）；
一条 HDMI2.0/2.1 连接线（随包装不会附赠）；
接下来，我会逐一讲解上述因素。
🍎 Apple ID
使用 Apple 设备和服务的基础因素。这里需要注意的是，由于Apple TV 并没有正式在中国大陆地区销售，并不推荐你使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 进行登录和使用，因为体验会收到最大程度的折损。
使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 登录时，Apple TV 将没有 App Store ，无法下载新的 App。同时预装的 Apple Music 也不会显示，即使该 Apple ID 已经订阅了中国大陆地区的 Apple Music 亦无法使用相关功能。但是，若先用其他地区的 Apple ID 登录，并在 APP Store 下载第三方 APP，再切换回中国大陆地区的 Apple ID，则已下载的第三方 APP 仍会保留。
所以，如果你想要正常体验 Apple TV 的原生各项服务，下载并享受其他第三方 App，请使用非大陆地区 Apple ID，我个人推荐使用美区 Apple ID。
📺 显示器/电视
最推荐的当然是一台电视，如果你有足够大的空间的话。否则，一台合适尺寸的显示器也是可以的。比较理想的是一台支持杜比视界的 4k 电视/显…]]></summary>
