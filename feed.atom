I've only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.
Really, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It's like independent music. You're writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.

 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…]]></summary>

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…]]></summary>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…]]></summary>

These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.]]></summary>

This is not new. For years, Netanyahu has served the role of a social media meme. During his United Nations General Assembly speech in September 2012, the Israeli leader displayed a bomb diagram to fan the flames for another Middle East war. More

I joined the IndieWeb blogging community at the very tail end of March. In April, I joined a daily photo challenge hosted by Micro.blog. It was my very first challenge and had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed posting a photo a day alongside a community based on a specific prompt. I felt that sort of camraderie feeling amongst a blogging community I haven’t felt in a very long time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.
But there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can't help but hire you. Can't help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.
This is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.
What happened to being that intense 'Steve Job' type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.
It goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don't just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.]]></summary>

I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I'm afraid I'll have to settle for almost there. I'll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.
School aside, there's nothing much to write about today. The sky's been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good. Thank God for bread.
I'm starting and abandoning so many new posts. I couldn't settle on any of them, so I decided to do this one instead. Hope you had some good bread in your life today!]]></summary>

Today, the pride parade took place here in Stockholm. I met up with my mom, sister, her husband, and their kids, who had come to the city for the occasion. It was wonderful sharing the event with them.
Yesterday, I decided to return to Mastodon. I missed the community and created a new account (birming@social.lol). Thank you all for the warm welcome. You're amazing!
The day before yesterday, I decided to continue this blog. Since then, I've received wonderful feedback from you readers. It's made me happy, grateful, and motivated. Thank you all!
Three days, three different experiences, but one common thread: community. It's easy to overlook this invaluable aspect of life. However, when it's absent, we truly understand its significance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seeing as how I don't practice gratitude nearly as much as I want to, I thought that I'd keep today's post short and list a bunch of things that I am grateful for in no particular order.
The chilly morning winter air
Being able to admire beautiful sunrise and sunsets
The colourful sound of bird calls
The feeling of serenity when I have a glass of tea in the early hours of the morning
The peace I feel whenever I sit down to write a post
Moments spent with loved ones
Sleeping in on the weekends
Tasty food
You, for reading this post!
I would love to hear what your "little things" are! Leave a message in my guest book or shoot me a message on the Blaugust discord.

Like a lot of people, I've been using different names online for years. Obviously not to commit crimes, but to make it less likely I become a victim of one. Also, I just like it. Names fascinate me: they make up such a big part of our first impressions. I've tried feminine names and not-so-feminine ones. I've never tried a really masculine name, though—I've always loved being a woman, online and offline, even if it comes with many inconveniences of varying sizes.
I took Valentine from the Måneskin song of the same name. But if that's too somber for you, there's also the Laufey song, which i…]]></summary>

I think we were all pretty happy to see each other. Things haven't always been this way, so I'm grateful our relationships have improved as the years go by. One of the things I don't think gets talked about enough is how important (and difficult!) the task of forgiving your parents is. Of course nothing will undo what we saw, felt, and heard as kids but (most of) our parents were just trying their best. Aren't we all? I know I would want to be forgiven if I had tried my best, even if things didn't come out exactly as I'd hoped.

Here we are a day later, and I still don’t quite have the words for it. I always fall back to a post I’ve written of not wanting to talk about myself as an explanation. Either way, I’ve come to realize that I never did do a proper introduction on this blog, outside of my About me page. In my defense, I think what I have written on there is enough to kind of get a gist for who I am.
But since I’m writing a post anyways, I figured I’d say something else that doesn’t completely repeat everything written on there.

It is no secret that these platforms can and have caused harm to their user's mental health (me included!), but even knowing this I've sat on my hands for years before actually taking action to remedy this situation.
However, as a lot of you know, it's not easy to just drop social media cold turkey. In my opinion, I think there are a few main reasons why this is the case, and I will attempt to argue against each one in this post.

But as a daughter of Appalachia and a professor of anthropology at a public university, J.D. Vance’s claim to represent Appalachia and his threats to attack our nation’s universities and their professors, who he’s labeled “the enemy,” are personal for me. Echoing other Appalachia-raised writers who have recently weighed in, I say to J.D. Vance: you are a hillbilly phony (Caleb Miller). You don’t represent us (Neema Avashia). And you can keep your “elegy” (Ivy Brashear) because hillbillies don’t need one (Meredith McCarroll). Your Hillbilly Elegy is a political platform disguised as a memoir, and I call bullshit. More

This is probably why he thought he could get away with saying he killed Massey in self-defense, as she was charging toward him with a pot of boiling water. What Grayson didn’t realize is that his partner’s body cam recorded the entire fatal encounter, showing that the diminutive, unarmed Massey was hiding from the Springfield deputy, when Grayson walked around the kitchen counter, shot her in the face and left her to bleed out. Then he lied about it…lies that were caught on tape and exposed as lies on tape. More

 The ghost of Turgenev crying 
 “Enough!” 
 Is in my ears 
 My activities are glorious 
 While several seasons 
 Fighting disease 
 Living closely with personal existential uncertainty 
 My body is marked 
 There is a thin line 
 Across my left eyelid 
 A scar from where it was removed 
 I am tired of this 
 There is a book 
 Being written 
 The first section poems like this 
 I wonder if it’s my last 
 I don’t know

 All things are possible 
 So say Shestov and Fondane 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 Including the impossibility 
 Of my writing another book after this

 For all life

It Doesn’t Have to Be This Way, You Know
 There is a beauty that creeps in under the plastic blinds, covering the window, in the form of sunlight. A beauty that seems an attempt by the world outside to draw some contrast to the words I write here, and that you will read later on. That for all the expression of pain, and dissatisfaction, and desire for more, there is still beauty to be found here, bouncing around the walls of this mold infested apartment.

A Few Words From the Distro
 Riding freight is a core skill for anti-work, anti-school, individualist anarchists, lifestylists, nomads, oogles, crust punk dirty kids, and travelers. 
 Hate your job? Quit and go train hopping! 
 Sick of school? Drop out and go train hopping! 
 Feeling suicidal with no fun and excitement in your life? 
 Try something new, open a new chapter and go train hopping! 
 But train hopping is very dangerous! You SERIOUSLY could die. 
 But you could also die in a car wreck on the way to work, or die from getting shot to death by a mass shooter. 
 At the end of the da…]]></summary>

PREFACE
 Welcome to the collective book on collective process! Over the course of the twenty or so years that AK Press has been publishing and distributing anarchist and radical literature, we've gotten a lot of requests for good, short overviews of topics that are of interest to the folks in our communities: anarchism, worker's rights, solidarity economics, and countless other things. We do our best to seek out books to publish or distribute that meet our readers’ needs, but it can take a while to find exactly the right author or book.

 The formation of Buddhist socialism in Japan made a belated start and its influence was little compared with that of Christian socialism in Europe, or even with the revolutionary movement (1851-1864) which occurred in the period of “idle peace” started by Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全) in China. The reason for the belated start seems to be indirectly concerned with national isolationism and the slow development of capitalism in Japan. The Communist Manifesto was published 20 years before the Meiji Restoration and the first volume of Das Kapital was issued a year before the Meiji Restoration. Directly…]]></summary>

 In the West, it is practically impossible to speak publicly about Hamas in any way that isn't an outright and total condemnation. Behind such remarkable limitation of the spectrum of public debate lies the idea that Hamas represents an "evil" so deep that it lacks any complexity. In parliaments, universities and newspapers, Hamas is never discussed, simply because -- it is assumed -- there is nothing to discuss. The idea that Hamas is simply a "terrorist" group that wants nothing but dea…]]></summary>

I have a ritual. Every time I set out to do something new, be it a new habit, a new course, or a new adventure in life, I ask myself, why?

So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.
This isn't just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world.

Crazy? Maybe.
But that’s how it sometimes is. You can’t always reason your way to the right decision. At least, I can’t. I’d been pondering this for weeks...
It was only when the idea became a reality that I realized it was a bad one. I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.
And when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision. Weeks of theoretical pondering didn’t help at all, while taking concrete action gave me an answer in a few hours.
Detours can be shortcuts, at least sometimes and for me. Sorry for the confusion — and welcome to my world. I hope you have the patience to stick around...]]></summary>

 CGT, Confederación General del Trabajo, is the confederation that represents the majoritarian sector of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism. The railway section of CGT is among the strongest in the confederation, and the 2015 elections, despite a frontal attack against the union aimed at reducing its representation, secured the presence of CGT in the works’ council of both RENFE and ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias, the Spanish railway…]]></summary>

 On many levels it seems almost pointless to write yet another text on Aufhebengate, especially a review about a book on the scandal and the controversies and collaboration-sympathizing that occurred in the vain, and inexplicable, attempt to defend John Drury from his own actions. Usually interpersonal issues point more to the poverty of the militancy and viability of certain circles of so-called “radical scenes” than anything of consequence. In these cases I would usually not waste my time writing a critique of a second-rate academic who writes for a gener…]]></summary>

Title: A Catalyst for Fascist Reaction
Date: 7/20/2024
Source: https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/a-catalyst-for-fascist-reaction/

 The fallout from the attempted assassination on United States presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, will bring an increase in fascist propaganda and reactionary attitudes, while also having serious societal repercussions for marginalized groups and political dissidents. While anarchists typically, and rightfully, disparage engagement in electoral politics, the occurrence of this event will likely have effects far beyond just the 2024 United States election. The main focus of this article is to engage with the likely fallout and effects of such an assassination attempt, rather than discuss the actuality of the attempt in a substantive manner.

Country drives, flea market barn jaunts, dinner with his mom, double dog walks + cuddled-up binging our favorite show.

He took me to see his parent's house, where he grew up which he’s called home his entire life.
It's strange to witness someone have such an intimate connection to land and environment. The ease and pride as he recounts the tapestry of stories that make up his town. I envy his deep roots.
I've moved so many times that I've lost count of how many addresses I've held.
He said he wanted to share his roots with me. Might have been the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me.

red rubber ball, Courtice, ON
On Sunday, he took me to the Courtice Flea Market, where I found two records that I immediately bought:

Tony Molina, Confront The Truth, 2016. Think: Weezer, The Beatles, with a dash of punk.

Cat Power, Moon Pix, 1998. What a breathtaking cover.
