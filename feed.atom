        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Kubernetes continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of
container orchestration, the community has decided to move cgroup v1 support
into maintenance mode in v1.31.
This shift aligns with the broader industry's move towards cgroup v2, offering
improved functionalities: including scalability and a more consistent interface.
Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let's take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for
maintaining system performance and ensuring that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the "PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime" feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.
For more details, read about
Phase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.]]></summary>

The feature gate mechanism is what enables incremental graduation of a feature through the stages Alpha, Beta, and GA.
Kubernetes components, such as kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler, use the client-go library to interact with the API.
The same library is used across the Kubernetes ecosystem to build controllers, tools, webhooks, and more. client-go now includes
its own feature gating mechanism, giving developers and cluster administrators more control over how they adopt client features.

From 1933 to 1939, Hitler provided the future government of Israel with the assets of German Jews in exchange for aid undermining an international anti-Nazi boycott.
On March 19, 1933 — less than three months after Adolph Hitler had been elected chancellor of Germany — flags of the reigning National Socialist German Workers’ Party bearing black swastikas against blood-red fields were unfurled from the German consulates in Jerusalem and Jaffa, both then part of British-controlled Palestine. Already aware of the Nazi’s rabid anti-Semitism, the residents of nearby Tel Aviv, one of the relatively few Jewish settlements in Palestine at the time, prepared to tear down and burn the swastikas. But before they could storm the consulates, the erstwhile anti-fascists were halted by a combination of forces: the colonial authorities of the British, who were still in the mode of appeasing Hitler, and more surprisingly, the leadership of the Zionist movement, which sought a Jewish state in Palestine. While the British were fearful of igniting what would inevitably become World War II, the Zionists looked to preserve their own organizing and fundraising activities in Germany, then home to more than half a million Jews.

How can Stoicism, a philosophy that has largely come down to us from the hierarchical, centralised, statist, Roman Empire and whose most famous adherent was an absolute Monarch, be reconciled with Anarchy?
 At first consideration Anarchy and Stoicism seem unlikely bedfellows. Much of Stoicism has come down to us through the Roman' Late Stoa' of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Seneca was a Billionaire slave-owner politician, and Marcus Aurelius was an absolute monarch… but Epictetus was a disabled enslaved person,…]]></summary>

They discuss the process of pulling their works out of the exhibition; the importance of the academic and cultural boycott of Israel (PACBI); and what it means to be Jewish artists publicly confronting Jewish arts institutions that receive Zionist funding and are struggling to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.
Steph Kudisch is a trans genderfluid artist whose work uses mutated intertidal aesthetics and personal storytelling to dwell in in-betweens. They work as a teaching artist on Lisjan Ohlone land, also known as the San Francisco Bay Area. Kudisch and their collaborator Kate Laster form Clear as Schmutz Press as well as the collective Hevra Kadisha in which they create site-specific works across the mediums of printmaking, sculpture, performance, and sound.
Sophia Sobko (she/they) is an artist, educator & researcher born in Moscow, USSR & based on Lisjan Ohlone Land in Oakland, CA. They are excited about collaborative learning, participatory art, and co-creating a more liberatory world. Sophia is founder/co-steward of two queer post-Soviet Jewish collectives: Kolektiv Goluboy Vagon and Krivoy Kolektiv.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the French economist Thomas Piketty most recently exposed, capitalism, across time and space, has always tended to produce ever-greater economic inequality. Oxfam, a global charity, reported that 2022’s 10 richest men together had six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth. More

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likened Palestinians to Amalekites, an ancient tribe in Old Testament lore whom Yahweh told the Israelites to destroy—men, women, children, infants, and cattle. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant referred to Israel’s assault on Gaza as a fight against “human animals.” Other Israeli officials called for erasing Gaza from the face of the earth, claiming that no Palestinian civilians are innocent.
