        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For ages, everyone needed access to the American market. I used to call America “the consumer of last resort.” If you wanted to get rich, if you wanted to industrialize, if you wanted to scale, you needed the American market. Europe sold to America, Japan sold to America, South Korea sold to America and China sold to America. This requirement is why Japan was forced to sign the Plaza Accords, which basically destroyed their future. Oh, life in Japan is fine now, but it’s no longer the roaring Tiger of the 80s.
But America has lost its place, which is why China was able to laugh in its face when Trump tried to use tariffs against it. His assumption was that China needed the American market. True 20 years ago. Maybe true 10 years ago. Not true now.

But wait… there’s more!

The (anti)Federalist Society assault on the Constitution, Part 1
GOP Budget Would Make It Even Harder to Hold Trump Administration in Contempt
Shawn Musgrave, May 24 2025 [The Intercept]
…The looming showdown over the judiciary’s power to issue contempt orders stems from a single sentence tucked into the thousand-page budget bill, which passed the House of Representatives by a single vote on Thursday.
“This is a slap in the face to the concept of separation of powers,” said a spokesman for Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.).
If enacted, the provision — found on page 544 out of 1,082 — would restrict how federal judges can hold government officials or other litigants in contempt if they defy court-issued injunctions and restrainin…]]></summary>

“If you have any idea about Russia’s history at war you will see time and time again from (CHarles the XII of Sweden) to Napoleon to Stalin the ability to absorb catastrophic initial losses over a number of years to then having large wins later on and we are seeing this.”

I would simply add that the Russians trade space for time, Remember that Ukrainian Offesive in 2023 that was gonna end the war?

I recommend history. Read correctly history is much more like reading prophecy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While researching a post I promised on why France collapsed so quickly in World War Two I came across this video on the Russo-German Reinsurance Treaty. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It will give you a much more balanced view of the man–you’ll not be looking at him through the lens of World War Two or World War One for that matter.
Finally, I think all of us can agree that Disney Star Wars has been 90% joke. All except for Rogue One and the recently completed season two of Andor. As the Critical Drinker says, season two is “the kind of TV your sitting on the edge of your seat in complete silence knowing this is the kind of TV that comes along once every 5-10 years.”
I’ve re-evaluated my favorite Star Wars movies–not a single TV show, not even the silly Mandalorian makes the top five, except Andor. Obviously A New Hope is number one. Rogue One is number two, Empire Strikes Back is number three, Andor both seasons are #4 and number five is a toss up between Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.  What say you people?]]></summary>
