 “Anarchism is still the most beautiful ideal, and I think someday it will come,” wrote Lau Chung-Si (Ray Jones) from a small apartment in San Francisco. At the time he put these words to paper in 1974, he was a relic of another time. Jones was a Chinese man who, in 1909, immigrated to the United States and quickly became enamoured with the ideas of anarchism. He was involved in a collective of Chinese American anarchists in San Francisco named Pingsheh (Equality Society). He also attended meetings held by ot…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The full scope of Israel’s assault on Gaza is revealed through its relentless military actions, characterized by indiscriminate violence against women, children, the elderly, and non-combatants. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, the scale of destruction imposed on Gaza is not only devastating but ethically unimaginable. Since the start of the war, and as of the end of November 2023, Israel has reportedly dropped over 25,000 tons of explosives on the Gaza Strip, a force equivalent to two nuclear bombs. This means that the destructive power of the explosives dropped on Gaza in just over two months exceeded that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[4] According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the use of such highly destructive bombs in residential areas constitutes a war crime.

But this piece of common sense seems to have dropped out of the brains – if they have them – of American congressional and white house leaders.

That amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion. Not to be outdone in the stupidity sweepstakes, Joe “Copycat” Biden added his tariffs.

At the same time, I find it a bit difficult to truly embrace it. I don't feel like I have anything particularly valuable to contribute, and I think I'm a mediocre writer.
I believe many people can relate to this. That's just how it is with that inner critic, it's never satisfied. There's always something that isn't good enough.
If we treated other people the way we treat ourselves, we wouldn't have any friends left. And we'd probably get slapped around now and then for our terrible behavior.
If we list our favorites when it comes to books, movies, music, etc., then surely many of the creators would absolutely disagree. The creator and the created are too closely intertwined. There is no space for a fair judgement.
Perhaps this is precisely what we need to remind ourselves of when self-doubt is knocking at the door, and self-criticism is wagging its finger. Regardless of what we ourselves think of what we create, we can be sure of one thing:
There's always someone who appreciates it.
It's that person we do it for.]]></summary>

They say that home is where the heart is, and I wholeheartedly agree. A home doesn’t have to be a place, but if you had to put a place to it, where would you consider home to be?
My cousins, back in my birth country, will ask: “When are you coming home?” It always stops me in my tracks. I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time. Although I try to hold on to my culture, my identity closely tied to it, the country itself is more of a distant past than a present reality. And yet, to them, it is still my home.

By categorically saying no to quick calls, you're isolating yourself even more. While it can be distracting to jump on a call while you actually meant to focus on some coding, it can also be great to have a quick chat and brainstorm about an idea rather than let the other person work out the solution in isolation only for me to then suggest a totally different approach in the PR review (yay! asynchronous!).]]></summary>

We say things but can never retrace what we've said. This is true entropy in expression, and I think it's profound.
I don't want to dwell on consciousness and what it all means, since this isn't the focus of this blog. Rather, I want to understand how entropy rules over the spoken word and how we've cheated our way around with writing. Consider this blog right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I improve my programming skills and explore new tech, I keep getting overwhelmed by all the information. Maybe I’m just impatient, but it’s incredibly frustrating to spend time messing around with code and end up with nothing to show for it. I mentioned this in another blog, but I still don’t know how to feel about it. Is it me? Is it just the nature of programming?
I’ve been coding as a hobbyist for a while, but this year I decided to take it more seriously and learn better practices. I wanted to make coding a daily habit. However, as I dive into more complex repositories, I often find myself going down a rabbit hole of reading docs, code, and comments, trying to figure out what I need to produce the results I want. I end up coding all day, only to see a few lines of code actually make it into the final product.
It’s definitely a lack of domain knowledge in the libraries I’m using, but is there no faster way to learn them?
Now that I think about it, I’ve been exploring a lot of new repos lately—botting, Roblox scripting, Textual, and Hugo. Maybe it’s just an odd situation where I feel like I’m drowning in technology.
Do you feel the same way? If you’re more experienced, does this feeling go away as you get better? I doubt it. Love to hear back from someone.
P.S. I think I just need to keep at it.

One thing I loved about doing technical enterprise sales is that I’d meet people doing something I knew little or nothing about and who didn’t really understand what we offered but had a problem they could explain and our offering could help with.
They’d have deep technical knowledge of their domain and we had the same in ours, and there was just enough shared knowledge at the interface between the two that we could have fun and useful discussions. Lots of mutual respect.  I’ve always enjoyed working with smart people even when I don’t really understand what they do.
Of course there were also idiots, but generally they weren’t interested in paying what we charged, so that was OK.

provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator's point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image=busybox --profile=netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific

This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.
Understanding the feature
Traditionally, Kubernetes' CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…]]></summary>

The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn't belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn't enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn't have my glasses, phone, or wallet.
I really don't know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car. I had to beg for money and walk the last several miles once I recognized finally where I was. It really sucked, and ever since then I've had a great deal of sympathy for people that are churned through this terrible system and spit right back out with no dignity whatsoever, let alone empathy. This incident disrupted my life irreversibly (ended up missing tests and having to do a medical withdrawal from school, lost scholarships, etc) and derailed a lot of things I had wanted to do for many, many years. The hospital/medical care industrial complex doesn't optimize for empathy. They're just trying to get the bodies through as quickly as possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'd be amazed how bad hospitals can be at keeping track of fairly critical things.
I had a cousin who voluntarily checked himself into the hospital related to severe withdrawal symptoms (and had bouts of psychosis related to said with withdrawal - meth addictions are nasty).  His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.
Late that night, he was discharged. Not even "he checked himself out". The hospital discharged him (and that's over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).
He had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn't remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn't get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.
The hospital had his mother's contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.
We still don't know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.
Forcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I'm furious about it.  Apparently it's common and not even something there's any recourse for.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design.
This is a super underappreciated fact!  It's often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.
Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.
Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.
Think of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.
For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.  Blacksmiths had a legitimately intellectual job back in the day!]]></summary>

"I don't want to work in IT anymore."
I saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.
I had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!
But over time, something started to feel off. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.
Then one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.
– Yes, I can't imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.
In that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!
When I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.
Fast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.
And when it comes to IT, I'm more passionate about it now that it's a hobby instead of a career. It's fun again!
Are you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.
Chok Dee, as they say in Thailand.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes I get tired of formulating words to help things make sense. At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.
I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

"I know you might be worried about regrets later, but sometimes it's okay to break the ritual, to interrupt the flow, to just pause and breathe it all in. No achievement is going to light up above your head when you write all the words, read all the books, collect all the things. Not one that'll be worth it in the long run anyway. Be joyful when you can, be reflective when you need to be, but most of all, focus on being. If that means writing, great. If that means quiet, that's great too." by Netigen

I've learnt a few tricks for managing early stage pain points.
- You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support.
- Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future.
- Invest in good docs, even if you're not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.
I think a lot of literature around running a online biz has been boiled down to rather basic advice and its hard to find anything solid in this area. I've been running a small blog where I document these issues(operational.co) if anyone wants to check it out.]]></summary>

 It is government suppression. It is tyranny. 
 Even until now, I am unable to give a viewpoint on whether the ending of a human life is a good or bad thing, regardless of someone giving me a good or bad name for it. Daring to be brief about whether or not to end a human life, I am neither for nor against either choice, because I am for the sake of everybody’s happiness, with an unshakeable faith to stand on the impossible conviction of working for the freedom of any or even all people. 
 I wish that I will behave in accordance with the demands of reason and not based on the demands of immediate emotions or instincts based on material desire. If this course of action is in a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'm living in a different universe sometimes. The consensus on HN seems to be that you can be pretty productive with LLMs as coding assistants, but every time I try I find it borderline impossible to get functional code even for pretty straightforward prompts.
I decided to fire up GPT-4o again today to see if maybe things have gotten better over the past few months.
I asked GPT to write code to render a triangle using Vulkan (a 3D graphics API). There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4's training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it's not a simple case of copy/paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)
Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:
GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer. So that's a guaranteed memory access violation right off the bat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet's cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn't new
enough to have support for this feature.]]></summary>

This conflict goes back a long time. In the early 1990's, with online journals just getting started, MIT was able to insist on principles like "anyone physically in the library has full access, even if they are not otherwise affiliated with MIT". A couple of years later, power shifted, and Elsevier could "our terms, take it or leave it". Then three decades, a human generation, of Elsevier rent-seeking, and so many people working towards Open Access, unbundling, google scholar, arXiv, sci-hub, and so on. Societal change can be so very slow, nonmonotonic, and profoundly discouraging. And yet here we are, making progress.
For anyone unfamiliar with "author [...] required to relinquish copyright [...] generous reuse rights", journals would require authors to completely sign over copyright, so authors' subsequent other-than-fair-use usage of fragments would be a copyright violation. Rarely enforced, but legally you'd have to obtain permission. While some institutions sign contracts easily, and struggle with the fallout later, MIT legal culture has been pain-up-front careful with contracts. Which is sometimes painful. But IIRC, we're today using X Windows instead of CMU's Andrew, because MIT could say "sure!" while CMU was "sure, err,... we'll get back to you... some mess to clean up first".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working as a SRE for a year in a large global company broke me out of this "panic" mode described in this post. To a business, every problem seems like a world-ending event. It's very easy to give in to panic in those situations. However, in reality, it's rarely that bad, and even if it is, you'll probably survive without harm. The key in these situations, and what I try to do (totally relate to breaking out in a sweat, that still happens to me, just happened yesterday) is to take 5-10 minutes before doing any action to try to fix it and sketch it out, think about it as clearly as you can. Fear interferes with your ability to reason rationally. Mashing buttons in a panic can make your problems spiral even worse (seen that happen). Disrupting that fear circuit any way you can is important. Splashing my face and hands with extremely cold water is my trick.
Then after you go through a few of these, you'll realize it really isn't too bad and you've dealt with bad situations before and you'll gain the confidence to know you can deal with it, even when there's no one you can reach out to for help.]]></summary>

 Another fighter became a martyr. On August 9, our comrade and anarchist-internationalist from Russia, Vladislav Iurchenko (nom de guerre “Pirate”), was killed in battle. He was 22 years old. Vladislav was part of the “Siberian Battalion” of the International Legion, and he was martyred in a fight during a landing operation on the Kinburn Spit. 
 Before coming to Ukraine, Vladislav participated in actions of solidarity with anarchist and other anti-government prisoners. He fought against Russian fascism and imperialism. Knowing that anarchists in Ukraine…]]></summary>

I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not convinced. Most of the argument seems to be that redundant UX is bad UX:
> But by archiving the email, the email disappears from the list, which already implies the action was successful.
> In this example, the button already includes a confirmation so the toast is entirely unnecessary.
I vehemently disagree with the idea that just because you're already communicating something one way it's bad UX to include another way of communicating the same thing at the same time. Redundancy in communication is a feature, not a bug, and it's present in all human languages. It ensures that even in less than ideal conditions the message still gets through.
In the case of toasts, having a single, standardized way of communicating the status of all actions (and if possible providing the undo) allows a user to quickly pick up on the pattern. Extra indicators closer to the action can be valuable too, but it's when they're paired with the toast that their meaning becomes entirely clear.  To remove the toast in favor of a bunch of specific indicators is to force your user to learn several different ways of saying "it's done now" entirely from context (many of which will be small and subtle as in the examples given). This might work fine for you and me but isn't great for, say, the elderly or the vision impaired or children.
Unless they're actually getting in the way, toasts aren't bad UX, they're redundant UX, and a UX designer shouldn't be striving to optimize away redundancy.]]></summary>

Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.]]></summary>

This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.

instead of SPDY for streaming.
This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs
matter.
Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that's bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create
a shell in a running container from your local…]]></summary>

Sure, you've learned. You might have explored a topic you're curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: "all the time!"
Please, re-read the question.
I didn't ask when was the last time you learned something new. I'm talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.
Maybe I'm alone in this feeling, but it's been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.
That's why, from now on, I'm going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.
I'm currently working on my syllabus, which I'll gladly share with you once I've finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other's schedules).
Take a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.
I can't wait to learn with you all.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came to this same conclusion some years ago while working on a side project.
Before anything LLM existed, I built a site[0] to generate fake "AWS Blog Posts."  I trained a markov chain generator on all AWS announcement posts up to that point, copied the html + css of aws's standard blog posts, then glued them all together with some python + JS.  It turned out, IMO, pretty funny!  People familiar with AWS's blog posts would often get several sentences in before they realized they were looking at word-soup.
When GPT was new, I looked into using that to "upgrade" it.  I spent a weekend messing around with Minimaxir's gpt-2-simple generating blog posts based on AWS content.  What I found was, ultimately, it was way less fun.  The posts were far too realistic to be interesting.  They read like totally-real blog posts that just happened to not be true.
I realized then that the humor of those early markov generations was the ridiculousness.  The point where, a few words or sentences in, you realized it was all nonsense.  LLM's these days are too good for that - the text they generate is sometimes wrong, but rarely nonsense in a humorous way.
Markov chain content was wrong in a "kid's say the darndest things" way, while modern LLMs are wrong in a "My uncle doesn't know basic geography" way.

As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.
Wow. I've never though about this before, but this is an awful second-order consequence of the high app store fees set by Apple and Google. It essentially incentivizes App makers to treat users as products not customers!

Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow—a far more important measure than accounting-defined profits—were $650MM, about 20% of revenue.

This feels like an example of the phenomenon highlighted in another recent post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41263855
Namely, that as long as Roblox's cash flow is increasing year-over-year, they probably don't care about profit. (And if cash flow ever does stop increasing, they can always get back to sustainability by pumping the brakes on reinvestment spending.)]]></summary>

About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you're willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
This becomes particularly problematic when running large-sc…]]></summary>

Eventually I got a letter saying I had to show up and prove I wasnt going to do drugs with it.  So I showed up with my invoice.
Then I was told I had to submit fingerprints and sign a letter promising I wasnt going to do drugs and I refused.
Finally a month later they sent me a letter saying I had forfeited the money and I showed up again (took a day off work) and they said I had to go to court.  So I went to court, and the judge spent ten minutes telling the cops that didnt show up I had to get my money back.
Next month after that I got a call saying I had property to pick up and that I'd be fined daily if I didnt.  So I got the money back.]]></summary>

 Vouching means different things to different anarchists. For some, to vouch for a person means the vouchee is felt to be trustworthy and competent enough for an action. For others, vouching means that the voucher has concrete evidence of the trustworthiness and competence of the vouchee, and is willing to stake their reputation on that evidence. 
 To agree on whether to vouch for someone or not, we need to be clear about what we mean by vouching. We propose three components of a vouch that might be helpful in discussing that meaning: trustworthiness, competence, and the voucher's reput…]]></summary>

You are a museum.
~evie\
In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the "artifacts" of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy. The things we (uniquely) enjoy are informed by factors as varied and disparate as our blood-sugar levels, among other things. We carefully display our "exhibit of love" in beautiful frames and tags. "This is so me."
Or, to put it differently - imagine an unimaginably vast wall that contains every interest, hobby, passion, and person to ever exist. The concepts of "self" and "taste" le…]]></summary>

Title: Why I Joined the Industrial Workers of the World

 Back in probably 2004, maybe 2005, I was working in Portland, Oregon as a landscaper. It was a small crew, just three of us and our boss. Our boss was, for the most part, pretty cool. He didn’t work us to the bone. He was flexible about time off. He was down to call me Magpie. He paid us under the table. Sometimes he’d cancel work to go surfing. That kind of guy. 
 In fact, after my first week of work, I told him: “hey I’m going to leave for about a month to go block roads in Southern Oregon to stop this old growth timber sale, maybe do some treesitting. When I come back, can I have my job back?” and he said yes, an…]]></summary>
