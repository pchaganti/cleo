(tab:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) A slow progress towards everything getting worse, but slowly and almost like an unstoppable tide of sewage down the Thames.
Below is a starting list of the things that are going wrong in the UK.
Obsession with top-down centralisation by the Westminster-Whitehall duopoly.
Cash flowing up and out to London or abroad instead of around communities.
Two-tier public realms allow the chattering classes/political classes to live in an alternative Britain.
The UK is lopsided and does not work in its current form from an administration perspective.
Our rivers are full of Shit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).]]></summary>

Title: Ethical Individualism
Subtitle: Selected Texts
Date: 2019
Notes: Translated from French to English by Kirk Watson.

Translator’s Introduction
 At the dawn of the 20th century, Europe hosted a brief blossoming of individualistic thought. Inspired by the great thinkers of the preceding century such as Stirner, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and Spencer, they offered a free-thinking, non-dogmatic alternative to the increasingly powerful Marxists and syndicalists of the left, and the economists and theologians of the right. Importantly, this generation of thinkers developed the critique of the State into a critique of society as a whole, which immunized them from recruitment by the anarchist movement. As Ryner says in the Handbook, the anarchists are naive: victory by the anarchist…]]></summary>

 Abuse is ubiquitous in our society, and as a result there are very few among us, if any, who have not been abused themselves or in proximity to someone else being abused. Myths about why and how abuse occurs run rampant and the ones that dominate are ones that ultimately serve in the maintenance of the status quo that keeps victims disempowered and silent. As a result, even those few who do actually believe victims of abuse and see the danger such abuse poses to them still often respond to the conditions the victim is entrapped within in ways that ultimately affirm the abuser’s narrative and fur…]]></summary>

The main purge was throwing out YEARS of old diaries and journals—all of them. Not one survived.
I've been thinking about doing this for a long time. Reading them made me feel horrible, and they all seemed to circle the same themes. Lugging those boxes full of journals to each new apartment felt tiresome. It was time to let them go.
I feel good about it. I'm free: to untangle myself from past narratives; from reinforcing and remembering things I don't wish to remember; to change; to reinvent the person I want to be.
Next on the to-get-rid-of list: books, clothes, paper ephemera, apps, expired kitchen things, tucked-away closet articles, + bathroom items.

There is a rough idea of what it will be about, but not much more than that. It usually works best this way, I think. As usual, my phone and computer are set to "do not disturb" when I'm writing.
Even the basic idea itself often comes out of some kind of void: when I'm walking, driving, or eating, for example. Poof! Suddenly something appears, like the characteristic light bulb symbol.
Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.
This is what Nikhil writes in the post Get Bored.
I think it's so well put. That's precisely how it is. Just as a document or canvas needs a blank surface to be used, we, as individuals, need an inner void to make room for creation.
Our lives are full of excellent opportunities to create these spaces. They're there every day: we're waiting for the elevator, we've stopped at a traffic light, or we're in line at the grocery store. Magnificent opportunities for a moment of “boredom” — an invitation to creativity.
Your best blog post ever could appear the next time you're on an escalator doing absolutely nothing.
“Bored to death” is the birth of creativity.

 An accident. An accident tore a family apart. An accident took a brave and kind comrade from us. We will remember the date. It was December 2023. 
 Death will come for us all. But, for now, we must put our shattered hearts back together. We need to organize. We need to fight. We need to grieve. Yet, we are not free to grieve, the same way we are not free to be. Not free to love. Not free to live. Countless surviving families and friends were vultured in one of their most vulnerable times.

 Generally men, rightly or wrongly, claim to have an intellectual and moral superiority over women, in addition to physical superiority. So be it! I want to grant it. 
 Strangely enough, in the vast majority of cases the man who considers himself superior to the woman takes little or no effort to reduce her inferiority and to raise the woman to his level. 
 This happens more especially among men who have a wife or partner. It would be logical that, if only out of a feeling of pride, the h…]]></summary>

 And they said, oh, are you the the lads that have come to fight in Lebanon? And we said yeah, that’s us. And we sat in the back of this Peugeot car and I remember Lero nudging me, and there was a handgun underneat the dashboard and there was a butt of what was a Kalashnikov underneath one of the seats. So I was like, well, this is the real deal isn’t it?

 The ecological crisis profoundly impacts the material conditions of social reproduction, extending beyond “natural disasters” to encompass a deepening of the contradictions inherent in capitalism. This crisis does not only manifest itself in events like floods, droughts, and pandemics, it also plays a direct role in fueling conflicts, social unrest, and mass displacement. In what follows, we attempt to lay out a comprehensive argument for the connection between the ecological crisis and the rise of what we call the post-fascist current, a poli…]]></summary>

 If there are two contemporary anarchist theorists whose work occupies and influences my thought the most, they are Kevin Carson and Wayne Price. Carson has spent a huge segment of his career not just reconstructing a mutualist political economy as an alternative to the anarchist default to the economics of Karl Marx but also making incredibly original contributions to the fields of decentralized technology/production and spontaneous organization theory. Wayne Price in turn has dedicated his mind to a task that at first seems wholly opposite to Carson’s: working to adapt Marxist economics and political strategy to an anarchist co…]]></summary>

 A wave of campus building occupations took place in response to austerity measures following the recession of 2008.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something has happened in connection with Israel’s savage war in Gaza that no one expected and that few even now want to discuss. It cannot be summarized numerically – not even when the number of dead and missing Palestinians now exceeds 38,000 and when the total number of casualties is well over 120,000 – the equivalent, in population terms, of 14 million Americans. Nor can it be expressed by describing the effects of starvation, disease, and psychological damage on the surviving two million-plus Gazans, 85% of whom have been displaced from their homes, and who now face continued air and ground strikes aimed at the remaining forces of Hamas.  More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.
But what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There’s no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there’s no sense of urgency in your mind, there’s calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.
When your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That’s when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.
Productivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That’s when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.
When you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a relatively new arrival to these shores having landed here to visit, but not stay and then, on meeting my partner, I began to visit more often till it was decided. I would stay, stay and pursue first, permanent residency and then, citizenship.
Well, after living here, in Quebec, long enough to apply, and sponsored by my partner, I applied to be a permanent resident. A lot of money later after being vetted like I was about to work at Los Alamos in New Mexico, on some Top Secret weapons program or with Aliens, I was finally cleared as being a desirable alien and given residency. Which afforded me certain rights and privileges.
From this point I had to be a resident for at least 3 years before I could then apply to become a citizen. Again, this is not an easy path or a cheap venture let me tell you. And, without the support of a sponsor—in my case, my partner—near on impossible to do. The financial requirement alone, is prohibitive to so many. But, me and mine persisted and finally, in August 2018, I passed the last hurdle in a very long and meticulous process to achieve citizenship. I presented myself to the relevant authorities, made a declaration signed my paperwork and was told I was at that point, barring any further complications, a citizen of Canada.
The finishing touch to make it all wholly official came later when, online, with about 100+ other participants, I swore the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, and sang O Canada in Canada's two official languages in front of a judge, online, with my fellow compatriots.
I was then officially a Canadian citizen. And I have never been more proud of myself, and my partner, at realising a dream.
And here I am, a few years later, on Canada Day, celebrating the fact I am a Canadian.
Happy Canada Day everyone! 🇨🇦

 Marxism shares one thing in common with other authoritarian ideologies: they are against the individual. Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or “anti-state communists,” they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin’s “Anarchism” or “Socialism”, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese’s Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. 
 The main gist of the essay is that individuals are not a real mate…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since WeblogPoMo ended in May, I've been stuck in some sort of writing rut. I'm still posting a few times a week so it may not be as obvious, but I've noticed myself living inside my head too much lately. And I think I need to get myself out.
As I always do, I've been overthinking about what I write and create. Rarely are things perfect enough for me to post, so they just kind of hang out in my drafts, or just stay written inside my head. Because of that, my head is now full of these nonsensical words, and I need to find a way to get them out.
I've been considering starting 100 days to offload, and I keep giving myself reasons to delay. I've told myself I'd start it in August for my birthday month, or maybe in November of NaBloPoMo (National Blog Posting Month in November), but honestly why wait? There's no better day than today to start, right? (But also because it’s a brand new month.)
So I guess here's my official 1st day post. 100 posts in a year. Check back with me in 364 days. I'll let you know how I did (or you can follow along!).
I'll be tracking my post here, or in my #100daystooffload tag. Come along for the ride — I would love to have you around to (secretly or not so secretly) nudge me and keep me accountable.
Ready, set, go!

At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike.

However, this is not what the land originally looked like.
To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It's known colloquially as eGoli, or "The City of Gold". Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don't have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it's mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.

The close environments of family, friends, and colleagues indeed have the most impact. So I never thought about the overarching environment I was part of, the city, the country. It is only over the past month I have been thinking about it.
It started with that famous hit-and-run case in Pune. Not the hit-and-run itself. But the coverup. The systemic failure. The corruption. The stories of this happening often and without any consequence all over the country, all the time.
Then it was the roof at the airport collapsing and killing a man. It is the traffic here in Bangalore. How no one cares about traffic rules. How the streets just fill up with water every time it rains. The power cuts. There is nothing new to all this. I grew up in India. It was all around me. I just ignored it.
I feel like I can't ignore it anymore. So the choice is to fix it or to leave. I have tried to fix things in my own way. It made me realise I live in a bubble and the majority of the country is much different from what I am. Or from where I want things to be. It needs a massive culture change.
To change it I will need to get political and dedicate my life. I am not willing to get into the shitshow that is politics nor want to dedicate my life to this. I want to do cool things in my life with cool people. And if I feel like the city or the country I live in blocks it. I will move.]]></summary>

Drawing from their own years of labor in the struggles against racial and surveillance capitalism, current work in HCI, and radical theorists like Alfredo M.

While I had already conceptualized and begun writing this piece prior to the publication of “An Anarchist Anti-Gun Manifesto,” the final form of “No Such Thing as Neutral” has been largely influenced by the response to the former. In particular, I was inspired by the common response of guns being “a tool” and “therefore neutral,” of the assumption that my critique of guns, and their world of relations, was of a moral character, and as such the concept of “neutrality” would hold some rhetorical weight. This piece is an attempt to break out of the confinement of moral frameworks …]]></summary>

 We must bear in mind that no government, honest as it is, can decree the abolition of misery. It is the people themselves, the hungry, the disinherited, who have to abolish misery. – Ricardo Flores Magón (Regeneration, Nov. 19, 1910)

 This afternoon we met with Dolores Villalobo from the Consejo Indígena Popular de Oaxaca “Ricardo Flores Magón” (CIPO-RFM). She began the discussion with an explanation of who was Ricardo Flores Magón–an Indigenous person from Oaxaca who rose up against Porfirio Diáz in the Mexican Revolution. He was persecuted so fled into exile into the United States, but was imprisoned at Levenworth where he was executed. Franciso Madero offered him the vice presidency, but Flores Magón said he preferred jail to his government that was not of the people and who did not represent the change for which they had fought.

Being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is especially hard when I live alone, well, sort of. I don’t talk much with my mom. Maybe I should, but I don’t intend to talk to her for the moment. That means, despite living with her under the same roof, I feel very lonely. And my mental health starts to deteriorate when I am alone and bored.
Thoughts could drive someone crazy when that is all they have being the single person in the room.
I am turning to y’all for support, so please write me emails at corneliuswastaken@proton.me. I would love anything. Book /music/video games recommendations, memes, photos of your pet, tell me about yourself. Heck, send me a string of random letters and numbers if you want. It is just nice to know that there is someone out there listening to my rambling, and that I am not alone. Expect the reply to happen in a while though. Replying to messages becomes a chore when self-care is in dire need.

What is Anarchism?
 Anarchism is a political theory which opposes the State and capitalism. It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one. 
 Anarchism is also a political movement. Anarchists take part in day-to-day struggl…]]></summary>

Introduction
 What if we didn’t need bosses, politicians, borders, landlords, police, or prisons? 
 There was a time when each of these things did not exist, and whatever you may believe now about their absolute necessity, have you considered that there can be a time again when we can do much better without them? 
 Anarchists dare to desire a world without rule. 
 Neither the rule of the minority nor the rule of the majority. Neither the rule of the capitalists nor the rule of the bureaucrats. Neither the rule of men nor the rule of royalty nor the rule of the elderly nor the rule of warlords. An-archy. Without rule.

 “You don’t know nothing, but you don’t need to know. The wisdom’s in the trees, not the glass windows”. – Jack Johnson[1]
 A lot of theories have surfaced in the relatively new millennium concerning the human species’ relationship to the planet it calls home. Historically, the mechanized view on nature advocated in the 17th century Scientific Revolution is criticized by ecological movements as alienating humanity from its origins. With the advent of the clock for example, man started measuring time according to its own inventions, exempting the sun of this function. Likewise, the clock became a metaphor for the machinery of nature, and “God” bec…]]></summary>

 What happened to the notion of revolution? In his companion piece to “The Movement of Refusal,” Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen retraces the rise and fall of revolutionary theory from its earliest systematic expression during the First International to the first proletarian offensive of 1917–1921, and onwards to the crisis at the hands of a bourgeois “anti-fascism” that instrumentalized the specter of fascism as a means to save capitalism, before ditching it, after 1945, in order to integrate the laboring class into the nation state. Although the post-war welfare state was the great achievement of the workers’ movement, the price paid for it was the ab…]]></summary>

 The other day my friend and I decided we wanted to visit the student-led pro-Palestine encampment that has recently sprung up on the lawn of OttawaU. On one of the organizing group’s social media pages, they had recently sent out a message informing people they were accepting donations, specifically of certain types of things (like hot water, garbage bags, blue tarps, yoga mats, etc.). I felt driven by the urge to donate whatever I could – so, during my shift, I furtively searched the back storeroom, digging through years’ worth of defunct paper cups, lids, and out-of-season teas.

A large swath of research in mathematics education claims to serve an equity agenda. However, too often this research is conducted atheoretically, failing to disrupt the worldviews that produce injustice and oppression, for both the researcher and the reader. Responding to this commonplace divergence of intent and impact, we propose a methodological approach that anchors research and praxis in a sociopolitical foundation of anarchism.

 ‘Metacrisis’ is my chosen umbrella term for the escalation of multiple global crises of climate, ecology, and political economy, which have reached such a point now that all radical organising is a form of crisis response. And I know for folk on the sacrificial frontlines of capitalism, the terms ‘radical organising’ and ‘crisis response’ belie that they have to fight just to survive. The metacrisis is hidden from many of us a…]]></summary>

A handful of Canon Coolpix: loved these things, and I feel like they’re making a comeback. I think I owned 2-3 of these in the early days. At one point, my university gave me one to document my “life as a student” as a part of their marketing campaign.

 The great European war has come. The truth has almost staggered our imagination, we do not know what to do and the one only definite thought is that we must win. To this end all our efforts are bent. We fight, with the men and women of France, of Russia, of Belgium. It is exactly the same, alas! with the men and women of Germany and Austria. We are all prompted by the same strong feelings of patriotism. We and they rejoice to give our lives that our country may be victorious, and more than all do we each rejoice if we may take the life of another. 
 Such is war. It is strange, is it not? Almost to a man we, in the countries concerned, have thrown aside what belief we …]]></summary>

 For the winter 23–24 issue of the paper version of the Freedom journal (UK) I wrote a piece titled 'Social Ecology vs The Metacrisis.' On the 10th of March 2024 it was republished online by Freedom as 'We Need A Plethora of Tactics' with the subtitle: 'Considering “metacrisis” and the ever greater need to re-embrace Bookchin’s social ecology.'

1. Introduction
 Mahayana Buddhism divides human history into three ages: the Age of the Right Dharma (shōbō), which occurred in the first 500 years after the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, where enlightenment was fully possible and the Buddha’s teachings were maintained; the Era of Semblance Dharma (zōhō), the 500 years following the shōbō era, where the Buddhist teachings and practice still existed but were deteriorated and lacked confirmed enlightenment; and finally, the Dharma-Ending Age (mappō), in which gradually all teachings bequeathed by the Buddha wi…]]></summary>

Introduction
 Making the shift to the consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that we can do to build a democratic society. Consensus can give us the power we need to focus our society’s attention on improving education, making peace, providing universal healthcare and creating the world we desire. 
 Consensus creates true democracy—not the democracy in name only that sickens any aware person. Consensus empowers all who participate in it. In-name-only democracy disempowers all who participate in it (who dutifully trudge to the polls every few years to select new masters). True democracy might be a large part of the solution to …]]></summary>

 Once considered the cool, edgy version of polyamory, a sort of polyam++, relationship anarchy is increasingly coming under scrutiny because it is being used to justify a specific kind of harmful behavior in relationships. 
 This behavior is probably best described in blunt terms: (mostly) cis guys are fucking around with (mostly) femmes, and disconnecting from them the moment there’s any mention of romantic feelings, hopes for a more ent…]]></summary>

Look out for each other. If someone falls over, help them get up. You are there to have fun together.
Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience. Stay on the outside until you get your bearings. Then, when you’re ready, venture further into the center to get really wild.
Never try and intentionally hurt someone. If you get hit by accident or intentionally do not retaliate.
Treat everyone with respect and stay safe!
