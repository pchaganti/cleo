        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading today's post "Curl is just the hobby," I stumbled upon Ludvig Strigeus while researching Daniel Stenberg (connection: both have won the Polhem Prize). I'm somewhat astonished by his life's work so far. Here are some of his key creations:
    μTorrent - a small footprint BitTorrent client for Microsoft Windows and OS X
    ScummVM - an interpreter for adventure game engines, notably LucasArts's SCUMM
    OpenTTD - a reverse-engineered game engine of Transport Tycoon, which led to numerous ports and improvements over the original
    Ports of Dr. Mario and Kwirk for the TI-89 calculator
    "The Idiot" - a card game for Windows
    WebWorks - a text HTML editor
    Spotify - a commercial music streaming service
    Spotiamp - a lightweight Spotify Premium client for Windows, created as a tribute to Winamp
    TunSafe - a VPN client for Windows using the WireGuard protocol

What's the secret?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alternative search engines are neat, as are RSS feeds. OpenOrb is a self-hosted app which allows visitors to search over a list of blogs you love. If you put your 10 favourite blogs in there, it'll search just those blogs and not show you any sponsored content or machine-generated garbage (unless... you follow blogs written by machines?)
Personal RSS feed readers can usually do this sort of thing, but RSS readers aren’t meant to be shared, so you can think of the search engine as a 'curated feed list as a public service'.
I wrote a longer blog post about OpenOrb here: https://raphael.computer/blog/openorb-curated-search-engine/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
in 2017 I started a project that would become MonsterWriter. First envisioned as a semi-structured wiki it became a writing application specialized for scientific content. It is a perfect tool if you write your thesis. While it is focused on technical content, you can still see the knowledge management spirit in it.
One or two years ago, my wife joined me in my efforts and redesigned the whole project and we recently released it as MonsterWriter2.
To celebrate this milestone we are giving away free lifetime licenses for the Desktop version (till Apr 28). Just use the promo code "gu0ho4q" for a 100% discount. You can find detailed instructions here:
https://www.monsterwriter.app/promotion.html
You can also find a short introduction video to the app on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR8i-EY_UBk
We are happy to receive any kind of feedback!

Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as "root": we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great article. I just want to comment on this quote from the article:
"Really good developers do 90% or more of the work before they ever touch the  keyboard;"
While that may be true sometimes, I think that ignores the fact that most people can't keep a whole lot of constraints and concepts in their head at the same time. So the amount of pure thinking you can do without writing anything at all is extremely limited.
My solution to this problem is to actually hit the keyboard almost immediately once I have one or more possible ways to go about a problem, without first fully developing them into a well specified design. And then, I try as many of those as I think necessary, by actually writing the code. With experience, I've found that many times, what I initially thought would be the best solution turned out to be much worse than what was initially a less promising one. Nothing makes problems more apparent than concrete, running code.
In other words, I think that rather than just thinking, you need to put your ideas to the test by actually materializing them into code. And only then you can truly appreciate all consequences your ideas have on the final code.
This is not an original idea, of course, I think it's just another way of describing the idea of software prototyping, or the idea that you should "throw away" your first iteration.
In yet different words: writing code should be actually seen as part of the "thinking process".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming from Java/Scala background, I am used to libraries that provide vendor agnostic APIs, such as micrometer.io, Dropwizard, etc., where you can plug-in different monitoring backends: AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus, etc., without changing the code.
Right now I want to add metrics to my Python application but I don't find any metrics library that does that. OpenTelemetry is not an option because it's not what I'm looking for: you need to setup Agents, Gateways, Collectors, etc., and in addition, their CloudWatch exporter is only EMF which is not what I need.
I've found one library which is "pymetrics" [1], which looks promising but it's in the beginning of its way, it has not much adoption, and it has only a few monitoring backends out-of-the-box.
What's left for me is to couple my code to the monitoring system I use, which means code changes whenever we want to migrate to another monitoring system.
Am I missing something?

AUKUS is the awkward-sounding acronym for “Australia-United Kingdom-United States”—a trilateral military alliance that stands poised to waste billions of dollars, proliferate high-level radioactive material and impose its safekeeping on First Nations communities for hundreds of thousands of years, increase global militarism and potentially provoke a nuclear war. If this doesn’t sound like a good investment to you, you’re not wrong. The deeper one digs into the details of this deal, the more one becomes flummoxed by cascading levels of absurdity. It is strikingly disadvantageous for Australia, yet other countries including Canada, Japan, and New Zealand/Aotearoa, have expressed interest in collaborating. Australian activists have been mobilizing to stop AUKUS for several years; it’s past time those living in other AUKUS states or those clamouring to partner with the alliance get informed and active, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image by Erin Testone.
Though Utah’s state government has failed to pull the Great Salt Lake from the verge of collapse, on March 20, 2024, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed a law that prohibits the state and local governments from granting legal personhood to animals, plants, or major ecosystems like the Great Salt Lake. The law is a reaction to a growing rights of nature movement in Utah seeking to secure legal personhood for the Great Salt Lake. By passing this law, Utah joins Ohio and Florida in banning rights of nature as a response to popular, grassroots campaigns seeking to secure rights-based protections for the ecosystems all life depends on. Because rights of nature laws would disrupt corporate exploitation of the natural world, these legislative efforts to squash the rights of nature movement are entirely predictable and similar to historical efforts to squash other rights-based movements like the civil rights and women’s suffrage movements. Instead of giving up in the face of setbacks like these, rights of nature advocates must learn how to enforce rights of nature outside of courtrooms and the legislative process along with adapting tactics and strategies for the long game of transforming the legal system into one with a rights of nature framing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> Stewart Butterfield, former CEO of Slack, recently described a dynamic within tech companies behind much of the over-hiring. He noted on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast in late May that when there’s no real constraint on hiring, “you hire someone, and the first thing that person wants to do is hire other people.” The reason is that “the more people who report to you, the higher your prestige, the more your power in the organization…So every budgeting process is, ‘I really want to hire,’ and that to me is the root of all the excess.”
I’ve seen this first hand. One place where I worked HR even had a table of team size vs manager compensation. When I pointed out that it may not be the best idea to directly incentivize managers to hire more people they were less than understanding. Of course it went totally out of control.
But sadly there just is no counteracting force (except perhaps mr Musk). When you apply for your next job as a manager they will ask you “How big was your team?”, and they won’t be impressed when you say “I managed to keep it down to four people”. It’s just something that resonates very strongly with the primitive side of our brains (“You say you were the chief, how big was your tribe?”).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note that the author of this piece is also directly responsible for blocking the acceptance of many new features in Carto, including community-developed and broadly accepted features like highway=busway:
https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/4...
Carto is of course just one style for OpenStreetMap, but it is also the default style shown on openstreetmap.org, with direct support from the operational team (server resources etc.). If a high-profile feature is not rendered by Carto, gaps show up all over the world where people use Carto-based screenshots, etc., and of course on openstreetmap.org.
The stagnation of Carto, and thus openstreetmap.org, the website, is one of the major pain points for many mappers and developers in the OSM community, including myself. (It also highlighted the failure of the OpenStreetMap Foundation to deal with this situation, although the recent move to develop a successor vector style is somewhat hopeful).
Personally, this makes me very hesitant to consider anything Christoph Hormann writes regarding OpenStreetMap in a positive light.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in academia. When we grade exams, the order of the exams on the stack is the order in which they were collected in the room (people can sit wherever they like). For grading, we are usually 5 people in a single room, and everyone grades a specific exercise for consistency. The exams are getting shuffled heavily, with everyone just grabbing stacks, looking for exams where "their" exercise was not yet graded, and taking them out. So basically, the order in which we grade exams can be considered random.
However, I also grade weekly exercise sheets during the semester, and these are committed into a repository, where each student has a folder that... begins with the first letter of their first name. Everyone I have ever worked with acknowledges that you have to shuffle the order in which you grade these submissions each week, for fairness. Several effects come into play: (1) your are usually less tired at the beginning, (2) your mood gets better during the last 2 sheets because you know you are done soon, (3, and crucially) at the beginning, you have not yet seen all the common errors / developed a "feeling" for them, and you might thus miss them in early submissions, but spot them immediately in later submissions.
Another alphabetic effect: In elementary school, my name was on top of the list of students in my class. I remember that I often had to do some special job simply because I was the first name on this list (for example, carry a group ticket when we visited some museum, keep track of something, be the first at something where nobody wanted to be the first, with everyone watching, be the first to be graded in PE, again with everyone watching, etc.). As a fairly shy kid, this already annoyed me in first grade.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main thing you want to do when optimizing the calling convention is measure its perf, not ruminate about what you think is good. Code performs well if it runs fast, not if it looks like it will.
Sometimes, what the author calls bad code is actually the fastest thing you can do for totally not obvious reasons. The only way to find out is to measure the performance on some large benchmark.
One reason why sometimes bad looking calling conventions perform well is just that they conserve argument registers, which makes the register allocator’s life a tad easier.
Another reason is that the CPUs of today are optimized on traces of instructions generated by C compilers. If you generate code that looks like what the C compiler would do - which passes on the stack surprisingly often, especially if you’re MSVC - then you hit the CPU’s sweet spot somehow.
Another reason is that inlining is so successful, so calls are a kind of unusual boundary on the hot path. It’s fine to have some jank on that boundary if it makes other things simpler.
Not saying that the changes done here are bad, but I am saying that it’s weird to just talk about what looks like weird code without measuring.
(Source: I optimized calling conventions for a living when I worked on JavaScriptCore. I also optimized other things too but calling conventions are quite dear to my heart. It was surprising how often bad-looking pass-on-the-stack code won on big, real code. Weird but true.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just want to express how grateful I am that Zuck and Yann and the rest of the Meta team have adopted an open approach and are sharing the model weights, the tokenizer, information about the training data, etc. They, more than anyone else, are responsible for the explosion of open research and improvement that has happened with things like llama.cpp that now allow you to run quite decent models locally on consumer hardware in a way that you can avoid any censorship or controls.
Not that I even want to make inference requests that would run afoul of the controls put in place by OpenAI and Anthropic (I mostly use it for coding stuff), but I hate the idea of this powerful technology being behind walls and having gate-keepers controlling how you can use it.
Obviously, there are plenty of people and companies out there that also believe in the open approach. But they don't have hundreds of billions of dollars of capital and billions in sustainable annual cash flow and literally ten(s) of billions of dollars worth of GPUs! So it's a lot more impactful when they do it. And it basically sets the ground rules for everyone else, so that Mistral now also feels compelled to release model weights for most of their models.
Anyway, Zuck didn't have to go this way. If Facebook were run by "professional" outside managers of the HBS/McKinsey ilk, I think it's quite unlikely that they would be this open with everything, especially after investing so much capital and energy into it. But I am very grateful that they are, and think we all benefit hugely from not only their willingness to be open and share, but also to not use pessimistic AI "doomerism" as an excuse to hide the crown jewels and put it behind a centralized API with a gatekeeper because of "AI safety risks." Thanks Zuck!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I attended Lambda when it was first starting out. I think I was in the third or fourth cohort. At the time, the sell was that you didn't have to pay anything unless you got a job using the skills you learned from them. I was pretty naïve, I guess.
Things seemed fine in the beginning. The instructors were good, and I liked that there were actual live classes. Things degraded very quickly. They kept changing the format and the curriculum ("iterating"). They doubled the length of the program that I was in, which made it impossible for me to even finish it. I was working in a tech support job where we had to do shift bids and no shift was guaranteed. I enrolled in a plan that fit the shift I was working, and the expected end date, and when they changed the program length and format, I couldn't complete it.
They promised career guidance, including having a career councilor, but I never got one. They kept telling my cohort we would get our councilors after this or that milestone, but when we got there they would move the goalpost again. The closest we got was a resume course that was not relevant to tech at all and a resume review by another student.
When I had to drop out of the program, I tried to get them to cancel the ISA or reduce it, but they said I had completed "most" of the curriculum and thus was on the hook for all of the ISA.
They then started billing me for it because I was working in tech, in the job I had for 6 years before I ever even started their program.
I went to a lawyer and was told it wasn't worth suing, because they required arbitration in NYC, which would cost more than I would save.]]></summary>

I carried a beeper onsite so my superiors could reach me when needed (e.g. to discuss growing the account). During a lunch meeting one day, two of my bosses at the consulting company suggested that I upgrade to a cell phone, like they had done. I said I was reluctant to do that, because I valued my independence and didn't want to be on a short leash. They both immediately agreed that since they now carried cell phones, their wives called them too often for annoying requests, like stopping to get milk on the way home. I was a bit shocked, because I was talking about them, not my wife, but I didn't say anything more. (I got a cell phone shortly after anyway.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my project.
I use it as the core cross-platform event loop layer for my terminal (https://mitchellh.com/ghostty). I still consider libxev an early, unstable project but the terminal has been in use by hundreds to now over a thousand beta testers daily for over a year now so at least for that use case its very stable. :) I know of others using it in production shipped software, but use it at your own risk.
As background, my terminal previously used libuv (the Node.js core event loop library), and I think libuv is a great project! I still have those Zig bindings available (archived) if anyone is interested: https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-libuv
The main issue I had personally with libuv was that I was noticing performance jitter due to heap allocations. libxev's main design goal was to be allocation-free, and it is. The caller is responsible for allocating all the memory libxev needs (however it decides to do that!) and passing it to libxev. There were some additional things I wanted: more direct access to mach ports on macOS, io_uring on Linux (although I think libuv can use io_uring now), etc. But more carefully controlling memory allocation was the big one.
And it worked! Under heavy IO load in my terminal project, p90 performance roughly matched libuv but my p99 performance was much, much better. Like, 10x or more better. I don't have those numbers in front of me anymore to back that up and my terminal project hasn't built with libuv in a very long time. But I consider the project a success for my use case.
You're probably better off using libuv (i.e. the Node loop, not my project) for your own project. But, the main takeaway I'd give people is: don't be afraid to reimplement this kind of stuff for you. A purpose-built event loop isn't that complicated, and if your software isn't even cross-platform, it's really not complicated.]]></summary>

It was pretty much the only SEO optimization we ever did (along with a few DOM changes), because shortly after that, Google basically dedicated engineering effort specifically to crawling reddit.  So much so that we lost the "crawl rate" button in our SEO admin page on Google, it was just set to "Custom".
I had to stand up a fleet of app servers and caches and databases, and change the load balancers so that Google basically had their own infrastructure (although we would shunt all crawlers there).  Crawler traffic was very different than regular traffic -- it looked at pages more than two days old, something humans rarely did at the time.  It would blow out every cache (memory, database, disk, etc.).  So we put them on their own infra to keep them from killing the rest of the site.
And now I will hang an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.]]></summary>

MKBHD posts a fair and thorough review of a shitty product, which is exactly in line with what every other reviewer has said about it as well.
One guy tweets about how he wasn't fair, and how he has a responsibility to not write bad things about companies because of the size of his viewer base (wut??)
Now the entire internet feels the need to come defend MKBHD, thus amplifying the other side even more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was Alex (my name is not Alex).  Graduated high school in 97, but with a 2.1 GPA (yeah, pretty bad). Went to community college while working part time, living in a 'separated' household (mom/dad did the splits), supported both my parents both emotionally and financially (as much as I could) through their transition and new living arrangements.  We were all immigrants, and still learning the ropes in this wonderful country.  I did not graduate college, but instead went the part-time/apprenticeship/gain-experience route, while going through many roles.  My baseline was to be a good citizen.  A good son, a good partner, good friend, good husband and a good dad (4 wonderful kids).  There were many good times, but also sad times, including when we lost our house and cars (2008), and that month when we literally didn't have money for food... but this country gives you many opportunities.  There are safety nets, use them!  You just have to focus on the goal:  Move forward!  There is always someone else who needs more help than you.  Stay the course, and try not to lose perspective.
I'm one of the luckiest people alive because I live in this country, and was always able to surround myself with supportive, positive and forward thinkers.
I don't know why I shared this.  Maybe because I don't care to blame society for my adverse experiences.  Through those experiences, I learned to lead.  I learned to listen.  I learned to value and appreciate.  I learned to live.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conclusion of this data presentation is that so of these people are our collective responsibility, and I just wasn't convinced. I wish they had shown percentages with the visualization. They choose not to.
I was underwhelmed by some points that seemed like they should have been more shocking. Look at the huge number of people in the many adverse experiences category who made it to college, and make a high salary. that was shocking! and look at the people who had no adverse experiences and still managed to end up poor. how does that happen?
I was left with the impression that if the government threw a lot of resources at it we might be able to move a noticeable percentage of those people in a better direction, but not most of them.
The questions that remain are, how many people's lives could we improve and by how much? And, critically,  how much are we willing to collectively sacrifice to move that percentage of people in a positive direction?]]></summary>

The width of each group of people is not the same, so it's somewhat meaningless to visually compare groups without being able to see the raw percentages. For example, the "Many Adverse Experiences" group is stretched to be longer than the other groups so that proportionally fewer people in that group appear to be a larger proportion than the same proportion would be in other groups because they're not as wide.]]></summary>

In other words, the artists, venues, producers, and Ticketmaster are in cahoots to fleece fans for as much money as possible, and Ticketmaster is willing to play the 'bad guy' and take the blame for high prices, and they get to keep a bigger slice of the overall pie than they would in a highly competitive market for ticketing services because they provide that "service".
Take away this dynamic, and the face price of tickets is going to go up, and the total price is unlikely to change substantially.
Personally, I think this would still be a net plus for society.  In order for market forces to work well, you need pricing transparency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.]]></summary>

The sectors that are currently involved in this geopolitical race include semiconductors, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Despite their growing adoption, little is known about the effect of export controls on supply chains and the productive sector at large. Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.]]></summary>

Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.]]></summary>

Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest.

This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.]]></summary>

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let's explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can't you just use docker

The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.

Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers' exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.]]></summary>

with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.
Some notable examples brought to the attention of SIG Windows were:

One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.]]></summary>

In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China.
