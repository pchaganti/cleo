 As soon as you got any “bigger” health problem, you’re basically in trouble, not only by the things you’re facing by your condition, but actually the opinion is far harder. Today it is better to be some picture perfect child, young person or adult, as otherwise, you will be looked down upon by others. The silly of it is the fact no one is picture perfect, everyone who seems this way, it is just an act.

 Adults have consistently ignored young opinions and voices forever. It’s taught to us that we should respect our elders, because they’re old, and not speak unless spoken to by an adults. They constantly fail to protect and help us. The history of our world is filled with young people and children being failed by adults and losing their rights. From birth, we’re told that we are inherently inferior. Year after year, young people’s ideas are shot down by older relatives, older siblings, teachers, professors, leaders, bosses, etc. Our ambitious, often progressive, ideals and value…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to be obsessed with timelines.
When I was young and naive, I had a list of things I wanted to accomplish by specific points in my life. Some of those goals included:
Five years after earning my degree, I should be making a certain amount of money.
By 25, I should be engaged, and shortly after, should be married.
By a certain age, I should have a specific number of children.
Before that, I should own a particular kind of house in a specific location.
And so on, and so on.
Life is a fickle thing. I was young and didn’t fully grasp that wanting to achieve something by a certain time didn’t guarantee I would actually do it then.
Having a goal was good for me. During those 5 years, I worked really hard to reach a specific point in my career to hit that number. What was not helpful was being hard on myself and feeling like a failure when I didn’t meet those goal exactly when I thought I should have.
Then I turned 25. I wasn’t engaged yet. Granted, by the time I was 25, I realized that I actually wasn’t even ready to be engaged to my partner then. We probably could have, but it wasn’t the right time. It would be a silly thing to get engaged because I had set this arbitrary number when I was young and I wanted to meet some sort of timeline. So we didn’t.
Anyways.
I had a longer list than what I listed above. As I grew older, and gained more life experience, I realized that timelines are toxic for me. I still want to achieve certain goals, but I no longer want to attach specific deadlines to them.
I will reach those goals when the timing is right for me.
I shouldn’t feel like a failure just because I didn’t adhere to an arbitrary timeline.
All in its own time.

 The anarchist movement in the United States has had the support of leading libertarian intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky; but it has lacked a figure who could transform its guiding principles into something resembling a political movement. In the autumn of 2011, David Graeber seemed to be the man who could drag anarchism into mainstream politics. 
 Graeber, along with other leading figures in the Occupy movement, coined the term ‘we are the 99 percent’. The catchphrase caught on, and within weeks — with the assistance of social media — Occupy transformed a small group of idealists…]]></summary>

But some leftists oppose those government welfare agencies, too, London School of Economics professor David Graeber says.

Towards the end of the academic year, police dismantled most of these campus protests, arresting hundreds of students in the process and charging them with crimes ranging from third-degree trespass to felony burglary.

But Monet will not offer words to comfort and soothe at the expense of truth. “These days it hurts to write,” the track continues, “Every sentence is a false promise.”  More

A few photos of our Sunday stroll filled with bubble teas and empanadas in and around Berkeley, CA.

Despite her facial expression here (she hates the camera), Cocoa is actually indeed enjoying the car ride.

I'm in love with this itty bitty white car.

Cha Thai Tea with a 4.8 ⭐ Yelp rating and rightly so. We got the Mango Coco (whole mango with homemade coconut milk) and Mango Cloud (whole mango with cheese cloud).

I mean... LOOK HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS! It was even more delicious than it looked.

I thought it said milkshake but was then corrected after a closer look.


We got hungry after our bubble tea outing and decided to go to another place that sold more bubble tea. We didn't get any though. We decided to try their empanadas instead.

Kuboba Spot is yet another place with a 4.8 ⭐ rating on Yelp. Limited seating outside + street parking.

Filipino Empanadas FTW. We got Embotido (pork meatloaf), Chicken Adobo, Cheeseburger (weekend special) and Kaldereta (Beef Stew).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I'm trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.
If you're reading this you're probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it's the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I'm trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.
Simon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.
I keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I've received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.
Knowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board.

It now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.
These are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they've been listened to and understood. That don't cost much money but are priceless at the same time.
I'm grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you're subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.

records on my walls as art
sometimes it feels like a battle to exist and be who you are.
These days, I feel criminally uncool. I open the Substack app, read a plethora of girlhood essays, and realize they no longer feel relatable.
After watching ​His Three Daughters (a brilliant movie), I thought about my dad and the dynamics within my own family as he was dying. We all grew up with a different dad and experienced a different relationship with him, which seems so bizarre. I also thought about his clothes. Did his wife throw them all out? What about his deathbed pajamas? Are they hanging up at the Goodwill? He'd probably be very disappointed in me for not having a job right now. He'd call me lazy.
started watching the new Marilyn Manson doc series. I don't know why I'm so surprised by what was revealed. Disappointed, disgusted, and pissed off to lose yet another musician/actor I like to the pits of shitty behavior.
I wish there were more indie-print literary magazines.
I've been watching a lot of Mina Le vids while eating dinner on my living room coffee table. (My kitchen table is overrun by my unfinished jigsaw puzzle atm)
Life has felt a little shaky lately. I feel like I'm on the precipice of so much change: moving in with my boyfriend (?), finding/starting a new job, and living out of the city (can I be a country girl?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;
The 'chopsticks catch' was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.
The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn't the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.
The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.
The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I'd guess there are even more 'views' than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.
I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their 'massive' Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in 'full reuse' mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.
Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y'all did good.]]></summary>

Ever heard the phrase: "It works on my machine!"? This phrase encapsulates a common frustration in modern application deployment, where developers often encounter inconsistencies between their local environments and those of their colleagues or production servers.

For instance, Dev A might run the application flawlessly on their PC, while Dev B struggles to replicate the same success, even with the exact same workflow and dependencies. These discrepancies, due to OS differences, software versions, or configurations, cause delays and increased troubleshooting.

Docker resolves this issue by offering a consistent environment via containers. By bundling the app and its dependencies, Docker ensures uniform execution across machines, eliminating the "it works on my machine" …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, the booster was going about 1250 km/h when it started its landing burn, it relied purely on drag to get it slowed down to that speed.
Going by the telemetry of the seconds before the landing burn and noting the speed vs time, it seems drag was around 40 m/s^2 when it was going at around 3000 km/h. Since drag depends on velocity squared though, it had reduced to just above 10 m/s^2 just before the engines lit at 1250 km/h, and so would quickly become negligible once the engines lit.
Going by Wikipedia, the Super Heavy[1] has 3400000 kg of fuel at launch, so 3% of that is about 102000 kg. For the landing burn, it used 13 Raptor v3 engines[2] to scrub speed. Each Raptor flows about 650 kg/s max, so 3% fuel is enough for about 12 seconds for the 13 engines.
The empty mass of the Super Heavy is about 275000 kg, so about 377000 kg before the landing burn with 3% fuel.
Using the sea-level vs vacuum performance of the Raptor v2 engines, one can estimate that each Raptor v3 produces about 2.45 NM of force at sea-level. So 13 of them would produce about 31.85 MN of force.
Using Newton's second law, F=ma, this gives an initial deceleration of about 84 m/s^2 and about 104 m/s^2 when empty. If we do a rough spreadsheet integration, we get that a burn of roughly 4 seconds is needed to scrub the speed assuming no other forces.
Now, comparing this with reality, the full 13 engines were lit for a little over 5 seconds.
In my simplified calculations I was assuming full throttle the whole way, which obviously isn't realistic, and I also assumed 3% fuel. So over all I think that's a pretty decent estimation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> space shuttle was reusable
SpaceX builds vehicles. The Shuttle was “reusable” because they needed a term between the default for transportation capital expenditures (e.g. trains, planes, cars and ships) and the modified missiles that defined post-War spaceflight. “Reusable” in the Shuttle’s context meant  months of specialist overhaul time and the cost of a Falcon 9 launch in SRB booster replacements alone [0].
At the end of the day, in 2010, “the incremental cost per flight of the Space Shuttle was $409 million, or $14,186 per kilogram” [1]. ($591mm and $20,512 in 2024 dollars, respectively [2].) SpaceX’s prices per kg are around $3,170 on Falcon 9 [3] and $1,520 for Falcon Heavy [4]. Starship should bring those costs below $1000.

 Philosophy is nothing but a landscape of perspectives, worldviews, and paths, some meandering and some straightforward, some solitary and some crisscrossing with the neighboring paths, some long and some short, some trekked in multitude and some in solitude, some forgotten and some revered, some new and some ancient, all to understand and nourish the abilities and needs of self and a myriad of others. Being is becoming, the traveler and the path both change in the journey. Yet, even if the destination is all the same, not all paths are suitable for all.

It's quite barebones, and I wish it would be simpler to talk to bloggers. Not many blogs have a comments section, and if I want to talk about their post, I may have to email them or go onto a different social media platform to do so. I know I don't have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I'll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.
Rubidium hasn't been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.
Blogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it's far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.
It was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it. Fame isn't an issue, and I like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reported this exact bug to Zendesk, Apple, and Slack in June 2024, both through HackerOne and by escalating directly to engs or PMs at each company.
I doubt we were the first. That is presumably the reason they failed to pay out.
The real issue is that non-directory SSO options like Sign in with Apple (SIWA) have been incorrectly implemented almost everywhere, including by Slack and other large companies we alerted in June.
Non-directory SSO should not have equal trust vs. directory SSO. If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO.
SIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time.
SSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same. You need to take this into account when designing your trust model. Most services do not.]]></summary>

The $50k was from other bug bounties he was awarded on hackerone.
It's too bad Zendesk basically said "thanks" but then refused to pay anything. That's a good way to get people not to bother with your big bounty program. It is often better to build goodwill than to be a stickler for rules and technicalities.
Side note: I'm not too surprised, as I had one of the worst experiences ever interviewing with Zendesk a few years back. I have never come away from an interview hating a company, except for Zendesk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.
For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.
I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.
There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.
This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.]]></summary>

every now and then, i'll pull out my sketchbook to doodle something, or sketching stuff in MS Paint, or whatever. i'm trying to keep my creative skills engaged, even if it's in small amounts. but man... it's rough. i keep fantasizing about drawing beautiful illustrations, and not having the physical strength to do anything about it.
i'm accustomed to this cycle, but that doesn't make it any less miserable, you know? i can't even begin to count how many times i've been through this. my best coping method for this dreaded cycle is to avoid beating myself up over it, try to be patient and forgiving with myself, and chip away at projects when i'm able to.
it feels kind of embarrassing to keep reposting art from my archives, though. i've been posting art to mastodon/bluesky, since i'm trying to rebuild my online presence in a post-cohost world. and... i desperately wish i had newer pieces to show. it'll happen when it happens - i shouldn't risk pushing my body further when i'm already in a lot of pain - but i still feel sad about it.
just gotta take a deep breath, and be patient. in the meantime, i'd like to take the downtime to study art styles i find compelling. i've gravitated towards 90s anime fantasy art for years, despite my shockingly-minimal exposure to anime, so it'd be fun to study some artbooks. and maybe i'll take the time to work on more weird little web projects - we'll see.]]></summary>

I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I've kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I've started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.
All this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it's time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I'm forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.
I say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I've had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don't know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.]]></summary>

As the global COVID-19 pandemic is upon us, a number of mutual aid groups have started forming across the country. The groups aim at providing community support to those who are more at risk from the virus: be it help with running errands or cooking.
COVID-19 is a novel virus most affecting people’s respiratory systems. While in around 8o% cases the symptoms will be mild, it can lead to death. It is estimated that 2-3 people out of a hundred will die. This can easily mean hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone.
We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening.

 The signatories of this letter strongly condemn the actions and doctrines of the Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs)*. This strain of feminism recently gained notoriety due to their problematic opposition of the proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (these reforms proposes to allow trans and non- binary people to self- declare their gender without, as is the case now, going through humiliating legal and medical process). This law could help to make the lives of a highly discriminated against minority easier. TERFs however claim that the aim of the proposed law change is a threat to cis women.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After trying various solutions - including DeskPad - I came up with a custom cross-platform (I'm on macOS, but assume it'll work elsewhere) solution that worked incredibly well on my 40" ultrawide monitor: OBS[1].
Having never used OBS before but knowing it was popular among streamers, I wondered if I could use it to (1) only share the specific applications I wanted to share and (2) share them at a resolution that people could actually read, without constantly being asked to zoom in.
I first tried setting up a virtual camera and sharing via my video stream, but it was laggy and the quality was so poor that people couldn't read what I was sharing. I quickly gave up on that approach.
Then I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting "Windowed Projector (Preview)", it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.
Whatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.
It took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I'm very pleased with how well it works now.

theminimalists dot com, known for espousing simplicity, has a popular essay on their site recommending how to start a blog, which inevitably promotes a terrible hosting service they endorse. Video creators who talk about things like productivity also maintain SEO-first websites that aim at generating revenue rather than just sharing useful information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries' economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.]]></summary>

EVERYFUCKINGBODY TALKS ABOUT BLOGGING ONLY IN THE TERMS OF AUDIENCE GROWTH AND MONETIZATION. It is depressing to see that blogging is treated as a mere business everywhere I look.
For me, blogging is almost like a diary (Almost, because my actual diary is a paper notebook), which additionally serves as means to express yourself to others. Not shilling shitty products, feeding your audience AI text slop, and embedding ads on every page.

I spoke to my Taiwanese trans friend last night about how our emotions changed post transition, and how I--personally--don't get angry much (if at all) unless I'm severely stressed out, overstimulated, and then someone throws the final straw on the haystack.
...I may be talking about recent days, but hey.
My friend's interjection came with a wry smile. "You want to be likeable?"
Obviously I paused at this question. It sounded vain and shallow, but this is Asia. Results matter more than intentions, as our parents would oft prove by pointing to our tests. It's why so many Reincarnation and Cultivation stories exist. The proliferation of  skills in Asian fantasy exists to give you the result without hard work. And why would har…]]></summary>
