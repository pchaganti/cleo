The most significant recent escalation in the ongoing Zionist real estate project, enabled by apartheid and genocide of the Palestinian people, occurred on October 7th, 2023, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s prison fence, carrying out a bloody incursion on Israeli military installations and border towns. Since, the Israel “Defense” Forces (IDF) have engaged in the offensive flattening of Gaza, destruction of its infrastructure, extensive land seizure and elimination, torture and expulsion of its Palestinian population.

So at his next rally he shouted only ”Alles für…” and let them add the missing word. Openly racist and viciously anti-immigrant, his party pushed most other parties in a similar direction – to keep their voters.

This person was arguing that having an Indian name can be a hindrance when trying to do business online.
I don't think the issue is limited to Indians. I've worked with SaaS makers from mainland China who choose not to reveal they are from China and sometimes use alternate names online. They do this because of perceived negative stereotypes about quality and reliability that can come with a "Made in China" label.
It seems national stereotypes can also influence perceptions regardless of actual ability or experience. As someone with over a decade of professional experience working mostly with non-Indian folks, I've found that potential clients always fall into one of two camps -  those willing to fairly compensate based on skills and those expecting to pay less simply because I'm Indian.
As an Indian, it does sting to see the stereotyping. But defending it by pointing to the success of individuals like Naval Ravikant or Balaji Srinivasan doesn't address the root issue (I noticed this pattern on X).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been playing out for many years. And it's all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive's mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.
When IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:
The Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.
https://nwu.org/nwu-denounces-cdl/
When the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.
He also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see https://blog.archive.org/2023/12/15/brewster-kahle-appeal-st...). It's not. It's the logical outcome of one man's seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.
In addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel is trapped. Its debt repayments alone are massive. The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.
They don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board.
Without talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.
I feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.
I mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.
There was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.
I missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.
So here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.
Side note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Eiffel Tower was unquestionably the focal point and the superstar of the recent Olympic Games in Paris. That is understandable, since Gustave Eiffel’s master piece has been the emblem of the city for a long time. However, the tower is also a symbol of the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie, the “capitalist class”, a patriciate whose exclusive ranks also happen to include the ladies and gentlemen of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere... But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.

However, I am willing to consider the discussion about whether there could be merit to restricting the ability to write that value; I could imagine a system that populated it only from the actual file name and did not allow it to be written by the parent process or the child process at runtime. The obvious place this still falls apart is that an attacker could just
    ln /bin/curl ./some\ other\ name

but there are sometimes security measures that we use even though they're less than 100% effective so it at least conceivable that this might be a trade off worth making.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This day didn't start off great. I was supposed to be working in the archipelago, which I love, but someone had forgotten to book a boat for me. I was supposed to be on the island at 8:30 AM, but the mistake meant I would arrive at 11:30 AM instead.
Three hours wasted, and I was supposed to visit six different clients. I could just see myself coming home very late, if I even managed to catch the last ferry back.
Once I got there, it turned out that all the houses were close to each other. The houses were also small, so each visit was short. When I was finished with the last customer, she offered to drive me back to the mainland in her boat.
The day ended with me finishing ridiculously early.
So, why am I telling you this? Because it's so incredibly stupid to paint scenarios in advance when we don't actually have a clue. We imagine how...
...the workday will be long.
...the job interview will go badly.
...the family dinner will be stressful.
...the date will be awkward.
...the weather will be a disaster.
And then it turns out in the end that those thoughts weren't accurate at all. The sun came out and during the job interview, it turned out that we had a mutual friend, so it felt very relaxed and good.
It's so much unnecessary time and energy that we spend trying to predict what hasn't happened yet. Things we can't possibly know in advance.
Of course, it's good and even necessary to plan certain things in advance. To do your research and prepare. But it easily gets out of hand or is used when it doesn't serve any sensible purpose.
We might tell ourselves that "you want to be prepared for the worst," but is that really a wise strategy? Isn't it better, sometimes, to face the future with an open mind and open arms? That attitude in itself might even increase the chance that it all ends in a surprisingly positive way.
Let’s embrace the unknown and see where it takes us.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am deeply and hopelessly in love and there's not much I can do about it. Luckily, the object of my affection is my wife of eleven years. Whenever we are separated, regardless for how long, I unconsciously begin a countdown in my mind until I see her again, even it it's just from the beginning of the work day until lunch. I've never known anyone as well as I know her. I can tell her mood from the sound of her footsteps as she descends the stairs from our bedroom into the living room. Neither of us ever attempt to hide an emotion from the other, so intune we are with each other's feelings.
My wife is a classic introvert. Our home is her haven, the place where she recharges her batteries. I long ago accepted the responsibility for answering every knock at the door and being the one to deal …]]></summary>

In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.]]></summary>

- It's your day to day project and you expect to be working in it for a long time.
Scenarios where grepping is more useful:
- Your language has #ifdef or equivalent syntax which does conditional compilation making syntactic tools incomplete.
- You just opened the project for the first time.
- It's in a language you don't daily drive (you write backend but have to delve in frontend code, it's a 3rd party library, it's configuration files, random json/xml files or data)
- You're editing or searching through documentation.
- You haven't even downloaded the project and are checking things out in github (or some similar site for your project).
- You're providing remote assistance to someone and you are not at your main development machine.
- You're remoting via SSH and have access to code there (say it's a python server).
Yes, an IDE will save you time daily driving. But there's no reason to sabotage all the other usecases.]]></summary>

Searching for “fn doTheThing” or “defun do-the-thing” ensures that you find the actual definition. Meanwhile C lacks any such keyword, so the best you can do is search for the name. That gets you a sea of callers with the declarations and definitions mixed in. Some C coding conventions have you split the definition into two lines, first the return type on a line followed by a second line that starts with the function name. It looks ugly, but at least you can search for “^doTheThing” to find just the definition(s).]]></summary>

But another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window, which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we're staring at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do "auto white balance" that skews the results. It's the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.
To address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller, or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.]]></summary>

Edit: Possible improvements: changing the wording to "this is MORE green" and "this is MORE blue" and randomizing the order in which they are shown, somehow. I realize you're just doing some kind of binary search, narrowing the color range.

It was in the summer of 2016.
I wasn’t particularly angry at the time, until a certain event occurred. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.
During that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was "Frankenstein") and tried to read it.
I didn’t have my laptop, internet, TV, or even a paper dictionary at the time. I was furious and struggled to read the book.
On my first read, I understood only about 1-5% of the entire book. But I kept going. As I struggled…]]></summary>

Oof, this terrible advice cancels out an otherwise reasonable post. Beginners who don't know what they're doing are the last people who should be `pip install -r requirements.txt`-ing into the system Python the way this article is recommending. That's not only going to make working on multiple projects nearly impossible (especially for the kind of beginning students who get recommended Anaconda, which are almost always the Data Science-y crowd using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit, etc, which are notoriously finicky with version conflicts), but it stands a good chance of breaking other Python-based system utilities in completely opaque ways. This sort of advice can fubar a naive user's entire workflow.
I know virtualenvs suck to explain to people, but in my opinion it needs to be done before you ever tell them about `pip install`.]]></summary>

Heavier vehicles are safer for their occupants but more dangerous for others: The weight of a vehicle is a critical factor in car crashes, with heavier vehicles causing more fatalities in other cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
The heaviest vehicles kill more people than they save: Analysis of crash data shows that for every life saved by the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks, more than a dozen lives are lost in other vehicles.
Weight advantages have changed little over time: Despite improvements in safety features, the weight advantage of heavier vehicles has remained relatively constant, with heavier vehicles still causing more fatalities in lighter vehicles.
Carmakers prioritize consumer preferences over safety: Manufacturers are producing increasingly heavier vehicles, driven by consumer demand for larger, more powerful cars, despite the safety risks to others.
Regulators are ill-equipped to address the issue: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's rating system focuses on occupant safety, not the safety of other road users, and tax policies subsidize heavier vehicles.
Public awareness and concern are growing: Surveys show increasing concern about the size and safety of SUVs and pickup trucks, with researchers and policymakers starting to take notice.
Electrification may exacerbate the problem: The shift towards electric vehicles, which tend to be heavier than their internal-combustion equivalents, may increase the weight of vehicles on the road, further amplifying the safety risks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking about something lately. Something that's the complete opposite of how I usually do things — and it feels really good.
It's primarily the work on the Bearming theme that made me realize this. Before, I always wanted to have the whole picture clear in my mind beforehand. I tweaked and fiddled, turned it this way and that before finally deciding to release something.
There's been this idea that "everything has to be perfect." This has resulted in spending a huge amount of time before pressing the publish button. There are several problems with such an approach...
For one thing, there is no external feedback whatsoever when I'm sitting and tinkering behind closed doors. It becomes a limited creation process with a very narrow perspective. A one-man show for something that's intended for an audience.
Another problem with creating "for my eyes only" is that the public announcement will never get a response that matches the time spent on the project. It leads to a feeling of scarcity, that it's not worth it. I've spent all this time, and this is all I get?
The new approach for me of creating publicly feels incredibly liberating and refreshing. I first released a beta of the theme and have since refined it and added new things along the way. Having a changelog also reinforces the feeling of continuity and development on a creatively rewarding level.
I'm going to try to implement the same mindset with my entire blog. Revisiting old posts, reviewing the content, maybe adding tags or an image, and so on. A never-ending project without timeframes.
Bits and pieces that slowly, one step at a time, make for a more detailed and interesting picture – that's the kind of digital painting I want to keep creating.]]></summary>

We use an event-sourcing model which is: K/V database for primary storage (actually sqlite), into a golang event stream, then into scylladb for computed views. Various separate services for search, algorithms, and images. Hybrid on-prem & cloud. There are ~20 of the k/v servers, 1 event-stream, 2 scylla clusters (I believe).
The event-stream crash would cause the application to stop making progress on ingesting events, but we still got the writes, so you'd see eg likes failing to increment the counter but then magically taking effect 60 seconds later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Bearblog doesn't (currently) strip location data from your uploads, so you need to do it yourself
UPDATE: Herman just added a comment in the nolt suggestion that locations are now removed, and there is a corresponding commit.
A new uploaded photo shows that EXIF metadata (including location) is now removed:

Thanks Herman for the fast work! 💨
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier today I was reading some new posts by Visa. There’s not much to say about that, except that he uses pretty normal words and writes very well.
This might seem like an odd comment, but it stems from my reading of another post, A Brief Case on Bearblog. The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.
