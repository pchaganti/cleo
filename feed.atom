        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's true that we couldn't expect better coverage of the new Puigdemont affair from our media. For decades now, the international media, of almost all political persuasions, has either ignored the often historic events taking place in Catalonia, or presented them in a way that would not displease Madrid's rulers, of all persuasions, including the nostalgics of Franco.

In yesterday’s post, we proposed a methodology to evaluate the ampleness of reserves in real time based on the slope of the reserve demand curve—the elasticity of the federal (fed) funds rate to reserve shocks. In this post, we propose a suite of complementary indicators of reserve ampleness that, jointly with our elasticity measure, can help policymakers ensure that reserves remain ample as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet.]]></summary>

Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let's take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the "PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime" feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.
For more details, read about
Phase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates. To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.]]></summary>

The following is a preliminary draft of the preface to the Turkish edition of my book Post-Anarchism and Psychoanalysis, which will be published in a few months.
 This book is the result of spoken improvisations that occurred during a strange period of wandering. I was removed from my position as Professor and Chair of Sociology at a major Russian university due in part to a renewed military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The consequent wandering extended also to the streets of Tomsk, Sochi, Nur Sultan, Vienna, and Budapest, before arriving for a prolonged residential retreat in Cork, Ireland, under a temporary protection order from the Europe…]]></summary>

The feature gate mechanism is what enables incremental graduation of a feature through the stages Alpha, Beta, and GA.
Kubernetes components, such as kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler, use the client-go library to interact with the API.
The same library is used across the Kubernetes ecosystem to build controllers, tools, webhooks, and more. client-go now includes
its own feature gating mechanism, giving developers and cluster administrators more control over how they adopt client features.

How can Stoicism, a philosophy that has largely come down to us from the hierarchical, centralised, statist, Roman Empire and whose most famous adherent was an absolute Monarch, be reconciled with Anarchy?
 At first consideration Anarchy and Stoicism seem unlikely bedfellows. Much of Stoicism has come down to us through the Roman' Late Stoa' of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Seneca was a Billionaire slave-owner politician, and Marcus Aurelius was an absolute monarch… but Epictetus was a disabled enslaved person,…]]></summary>
