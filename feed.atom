According to the Tonawanda Seneca Nation, the USFWS approved the Genesee County Economic Development Center’s (GCEDC) construction of the 9.5-mile pipeline without conducting a sufficient environmental review and without a government-to-government consultation with the Nation—in direct violation of their sovereign rights.

On April 1, the administration of Pitzer College in Claremont, California, outside of Los Angeles, announced that it would be suspending its student exchange program with the University of Haifa in Israel. The following day, the Dean of Faculty’s Office claimed in a statement that the decision to suspend the program did not “reflect an academic boycott,” but “lack of enrollments for at least five years, exchange imbalance, or curricular overlap.” The statement could have passed for a belated April Fool’s Day joke, seeing as how students and faculty at Pitzer and other schools belonging to the consortium of Claremont Colleges had been demanding their institutions sever ties with the Israeli economy and academia due to the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza, which has killed at least 34,488 Palestinians, including 14,500 children and 8,400 women, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing.

The best one was an employer's site that described itself as "Easy Apply"!  You had to give it a resume, which it parsed, badly, and sprayed randomly into about a thousand text boxes.  I thought maybe the problem was starting with a pdf, so I began again with a Word document.  The results were exactly the same, suggesting they exported to pdf and used the same shitty parser.
Having to rearrange all this text into the correct boxes was annoying enough, but they weren't just vanilla text boxes.  They were janky javascript abominations that responded to input really slowly.

Two reasons - first, most of the time, these businesses know their shit is broken or they're doing low quality work etc. They just don't care. Second, it is good for our own stress levels to avoid dealing with shitty stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am skeptical.
Well before AI co-pilots something happened to the good old admins--they started to disappear only to be replaced by "AWS devops" (their job titles) who have never wired a network using routers, switches, and cables. I noticed that they started lacking basic networking knowledge and couldn't set up networking inside AWS. They just didn't know what a gateway, NAT, or subnet is.
Similar things are happening with AI co-pilots. We have an increasing number of people who "write code", but the number of people who can understand and review code is not increasing. There is also a problem of injecting ethics and politics into those tools, which can produce silly results. I asked Bard to write me a Python function to turn the US Constitution into a palindrome. Bard refused and gave ma a lecture on how the US Constitution is too important to be played with in such trivial fashion. I then asked it to produce code that turns the US national anthem into a palindrome, it refused again. So I asked it do the same but with the Russian national anthem and it spat out code without telling me off. I then asked it to generate code for simple tasks and it did an OK job, except the formatting and the fonts used were different every time, because it just lifted code from different webpages and recombined it like a massively hungover student waking up to realise he's supposed to hand in the assignment in one hour.]]></summary>

The reason for this is if you take lower rent than previously your building value changes and your lenders make you cough up the difference to cover additional principal.
Since the loans come due every 5ish years we’re now seeing buildings unable to justify their previous value, and having to walk away or get valued at their current rent.
It’s going to be ugly for a while.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Related, there are a few cryptocurrencies that used things related to finding large primes as part of their proof of work functions. It turns out that ~8 years ago, a really fast primality test implementation could make you a lot of money. (For some period of time I was the author and maintainer of mining software for riecoin. Why, I have no idea, except that I like prime numbers.)
This article omits the number one optimization for fast primality testing: Montgomery multiplication
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplic...
It forms the basis of fast practical modular exponentiation implementations.
Niall Emmart, then in academia and now I believe at Nvidia, released a really, spectacularly fast GPU bigint library, CGBN: https://github.com/NVlabs/CGBN
It's still the fastest batch modexp implentation that I'm aware of. It's breathtaking, if I can gush in geek for a moment.
(Someday I should write up the story of how that helped me dominate production of a small cryptocurrency for about 5 years. Thanks, Niall - owe you a beer if we ever cross paths!)
Also worth noting that python includes an entirely fine modexp in the three-argument form of pow(x, y, m) --> compute x^y % m
With that, you can very easily implement a fermat or miller-rabin primality test if you want to roll your own, which is quite fun. If you don't, the gmp library provides a very nice mpz_probab_prime() function. Gmp is obviously faster, but it's hard to beat the fun of a two liner fermat test for playing with big primes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was a karate practitioner and instructor in my youth.  Board breaking is really, really easy. The key is the boards designed for breaking are cut in their weakest orientation.  Wood is incredibly strong going with the fibers, even a pine board is very hard to break long ways using a sledge hammer.  However, if it's cut on its short axis, it's incredibly easy to break.  Most people, even children don't need any guidance beyond, "punch through the board" to be successful.  Breaking boards is more mental than physical.  If a student is struggling or a novice, the person holding the board can hold their hands a little wider to make it easier to break.
Concrete is more difficult, but there's still a trick to it.  The blocks you use for breaking have a bit of flex to them, but are also extremely brittle.  So just getting it to flex just a small amount will cause them to break in half.  That's also why you place spacers between stacks of bricks or wood.  You're leveraging the flex of the material to break it, and stacking them without spacers makes too rigid to break.
In short, this stuff is 90% magic trick.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm all for moving to higher-level skills, when I was an adjunct professor I usually didn't put a huge emphasis on syntax unless I thought it was important to explain a concept, and I very rarely took off points for syntax.
That said, I don't know that I would allow AI for learning to code in the class.  I do not consider "prompt engineering" to be a substitute for programming, and it's very easy to get AI to write some code and copypaste it, not understand anything it said, and be done.
Last year, when I was administering a test, I said that they were allowed to use any IDE they wanted, but they could not use any AI assistance.  I am pretty convinced one student just copypasted my test questions into ChatGPT or BingAI and then copied the answers. I didn't have a way to prove it so I had to give him the benefit of the doubt and grade it assuming he did it honestly.
Before someone says "YOU SHOULD TEACH THEM TO USE THE AI TOOLS LOL THAT'S THE FUTURE!!!", stop.  That's not true, not yet at least.  Just because I can call an Uber doesn't mean I get to say I know how to drive.  Just because I can go to McDonalds doesn't mean I get to say I know how to cook. I was teaching them how to write Java and Python, the goal of the class was for them to learn Java and Python, it wasn't learning how to copypaste into OpenAI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a person that used to be a “human scribe” but for emergency dept doctors. I would say the ER doctors shared the same experience as the one depicted in the news story. For a doctor that was nearing the age of retirement or had very poor keyboard proficiency. scribes were a godsend.
Doctors worried less about documentation and focused more on patient care. Of course they still wrote things like admission orders, prescriptions, and nurse orders. Scribes were often told to avoid doing these but sometimes the doctor was okay with it. I personally just told them to do it. Too much of a legal liability for both of parties.
But capturing all of the details of the history of present illness (HPI), patient medical history, review of systems, physical exam, procedures (if any) and medical decision making during patient visit can be a time consuming issue. Time increases with significantly more complex cases, especially one with more than one procedure.
Documenting it so that it can be billed appropriately is also crucial.
Prior to scribes, doctors would describe forgoing writing documentation all together at the end of the shift and writing it the next day or shift.
Obviously, this caused very poor documentation and opened up the doctor to legal issues (if they arise). Ambulance chasers can easily call out these inconsistent details between doctor notes, patient outcomes, and cross check with nursing notes.
Additionally, this caused cases to be billed incorrectly or “down coded” as well.
I don’t agree with allowing private companies unfettered/unregulated access to what is considered private medical information. But with appropriate controls on the data and who has access to it with full transparency, I think it can help in alleviating physical burn out.]]></summary>

The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.]]></summary>

Most big companies are not good if you want to solve problems and build stuff. Especially "the enterprise", where software is seen as a cost center so the less of it the better. The effort of managing up eats a creative person's soul.
I want the clarity of being able to talk to "the boss/the customer" and solve their problems and get paid the market rate for my skills. Not prepare endless PowerPoints for my skip-level, who has no ownership but has to act in their own best interests in a swamp of principal-agent problems.
This is why I am very happy at a fast-growing small tech company where one can have honest conversations about the customer and the product. How do other people deal with this?]]></summary>

Then I overheard one of them (the fittest) say to a budding runner that he [should] do mostly easy sessions. Okay what’s easy to him? He said that so slow that it can feel awkward and unnatural. What?
Then I searched around and found out about Zone 2 and how you should do most of your work in that zone when building aerobic fitness. And that it is characterized by being able to hold a conversation, although strained.
I searched around and found atheletes like amateur ultrarunners say the same thing.
Then it hit me. I’ve probably been jogging a lot in Zone 3. Or higher? Because the harder you go the more benefit, right? That seems to be the basic logic for everything.[1] Relatively short, painful sessions. Have I been conditioning myself to associate cardio with more pain than is necessary for the average session?
So maybe I should just go on the stationary bike today, do a “conversatitional” (talk to myself) pace and listen to my audiobook for an hour? And try to not let my groin fall asleep.

And as campus protests erupted in condemnation of the slaughter of Gazans, and especially children, and the destruction of homes and every major institution, including hospitals, these same institutions of higher learning began to disrupt these protests and bring them to an end. As a former college teacher, one who witnessed the attacks on those who protested against the War in Vietnam and who studied the repression on campuses during the McCarthy period, I became so appalled at what was being done to our brave and courageous college students that I began to write letters to the leaders of what are, in reality, academic enterprises.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would encourage not directly using the user-uploaded images. But uploading directly to S3 is probably fine. I just wouldn't use the raw file.
1. Re-encoding the image is a good idea to make it harder to distribute exploits. For example imaging the recent WebP vulnerability. A malicious user could upload a compromised image as their profile picture and pwn anyone who saw that image in the app. There is a chance that the image survives the re-encoding but it is much less likely and at the very least makes your app not the easiest channel to distribute it.
2. It gives a good place to strip metadata. For example you should almost certianlly be stripping geo location. But in general I would recommend stripping everything non-essential.
3. Generating different sizes as you mentioned can be useful.
4. Allows accepting a variety of formats without requiring consumers to support them all. As you just transcode in one place.
I don't know much about the cost on the AWS side, but it seems like you are always at some sort of risk given that if the user knows the bucket name they can create infinite billable requests. Can you create a size limit on the pre-signed URL? That would be a basic line of defence. But you probably also want to validate once the URL expires the data uploaded and decide if it conforms to your expectations (and delete it if you aren't interested in preserving the original data).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To me this is not even slightly surprising. Red Lobster used to be at the top of our list of restaurants. Then in recent years the quality of both the food and service deteriorated. One visit the food was so bad I couldn't even eat it. That was compounded by not having a server to talk to. Took our order and never returned - even had someone else bring out the order.
The thing about a restaurant is that you'll always have business if the food and service are good. You can talk about how the market changed or whatever, but no restaurant can survive at that price point while offering so little.
We had a chain BBQ restaurant in town that had a booming business for more than a decade. Then the quality of the food went downhill and they shut down, citing lack of a market. They had a market for years but there's no market for crap. Red Lobster's situation is no different.]]></summary>

They do well placed adverts/sponsorships (e.g. Standup Maths[0]), they produce a quite decent quality podcast (Signals and Threads [1]), and they have consistent monthly puzzles [2]. That level of investment in branding only makes sense, I think, at a large size. I'm kind of surprised they only have ~2500 people.

In this blog post, I'd like to dive into the functionality and history of three
extraordinary Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are truly outstanding in
terms of how they work: Exec, Attach and PortForward.
Exec can be used to run dedicated commands within the container and stream

With 900 million voters—more than the populations of Europe and Australia put together—the Indian elections are hailed as the largest exhibition and celebration of democracy. The nation's economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible

Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as "root": we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.
A container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.]]></summary>

The sectors that are currently involved in this geopolitical race include semiconductors, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence.

Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.]]></summary>

Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.]]></summary>
