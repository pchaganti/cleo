I'm kinda new to personal blogging; back in the 2000s I had a tech blog but I wanted everything to index my site. I even submitted my link to a bunch of off brand search engines to get my name out there.
But now there's AI bots scraping websites like iFixit literally a million times a day.
I don't hate AI. I'm not an AI doomer. But that's fucking silly.
Maybe it's just me or maybe Google is terrible these days, but all I could find were blog posts six months old or more that just listed individual scrapers that are probably outdated anyway. So I asked Claude 3.5 to generate me a robots.txt file to block all known AI scrapers and I think it did alright! Here's what I got:

In the part 1 of "Tensors from Scratch" we discussed about what tensors actually are how the shape of a tensor can give us important information about the tensor itself. As a recap:
tensor is an umbrella term for "mathematical objects" or "containers" that have a rank/dimensionality associated with them.
Scalars are rank-0 tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors and so on.
One important property of a tensor is its shape. Shape is defined as: the number of elements p…]]></summary>

From a Matter of Principle to a Matter of Tactics
 Anarchists who want to take action, when confronted with the choice of tactics, often default to large mass actions, like black bloc. Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past week, I have enjoyed reading various Bear Blog blogs. It's really interesting to see different viewpoints, and thoughts that are less filtered, and more raw. It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.
A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been feeling weird about my blog recently. It's a thoughtful place for me, but it's also felt like a sort of put-on place, like I'm playing a specific version of myself, or like my site has developed a brand or style, which I've already mentioned not liking. So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let's get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I'll be switching to Bear's "Plain HTML" theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I'm not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To "bear the boredness". (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eriq's entry in my guestbook led me to his recent post, Going from spark to a steady fire. He describes how passions often ignite intensely before rapidly fading away.
I completely resonate with this, just as he did after reading my post I wish I was more dedicated:
It's ridiculous how well that echoes into what I've written above.
Several others have reached out about the same post. One email started with "Dude, that's my life too." The sender described being incredibly invested in a project one week and wanting to abandon it entirely the next.
I've been on the brink of shutting down this blog multiple times, as recently as yesterday. It's hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.
It's living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator. I'm constantly considering pulling the plug. It's like a dragonfly that's been granted several extra lives, but now feels like its luck is running out. It's sneaking around like a cat aware that its nine lives are nearly spent.
It might sound bleak, but it's my reality. I doubt it will ever change. Yet, there's beauty in it too:
I'm not alone.
It becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.
We're not alone.
Blogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community. Keeping a private diary doesn't have the same impact for me.
Blogging is both liberating and inclusive.
I'm not alone. You're not alone.
We have a blogline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I stumbled across the Blaugust blogging challenge and thought it would be a good idea to participate. So I decided to join in for the first time.
"Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past."

I hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...
Wish me luck.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image by Heather Mount.
Between armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.
Profitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.

Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let's start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x = 33

This number $x$ is just a value and it is "dimensionless" i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

 On Isabelle Eberhardt's “Criminal” and Renzo Novatore's “Toward the Creative Nothing” 
 Quotes refer to the Eberhardt Press edition and the Venomous Butterfly Publications edition, respectively. 
Crime
 In “Criminal,” Isabelle Eberhardt's memoir of land colonization in Algeria written around the turn of the last century, the farmer Mohammed Achouri cuts an interesting figure. A “tall thin old man with the face of an ascetic, his hard features set in an expression of constant preoccupation”, a quiet character who stands “a bit apart from the others”, he is not a likely hero. Though he stands out, and in fact his inability to fit…]]></summary>

I've started some blog posts here and there but haven't finished them. Or I simply didn't publish them for various reasons.
Instead, I created a few slash pages, experimented with my site design, jotted down a few new ideas, read plenty of blog posts from the discovery feed and emailed with some wonderful Bear Blog bloggers.
And I had a lot of fun doing these things...
At first, it felt weird not to finish and publish any blog posts. It also caused me some anxiety. But blogging should be fun...
For me, Bear Blog is fun.

To keep myself organised and, because I love paper and all things stationery, I've been a journalist all my life. From writing in little spiral-bound notebooks and school exercise books as a child, right on through to a fancy leather-bound Midori (an expensive Japanese notebook) that was a birthday gift. I've been an avid note-maker since I was able to hold a pencil and write.
I've used all sorts of notebooks to scribble in, and even tried the made for journaling journal by Baron Fig—yes, what a great name!

I learned that my friend casually did it on his walks and stuff, and was able to identify birds. That was cool, and made the hobby a bit more approachable for me.
It wasn't until COVID when I saw a pair of cute yellow birds in the tree. Because the leaves haven't grown in yet, I was able to watch them fly around the tree, landing in different spots, and ultimately move on to other spots. I was so mesmerized, I thought I had just seen a legendary pokemon. I immediately went to google, and found that it was an American Goldfinch.

It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha.
