There’s a lot of not so great things happening in the world right now that we often forget to be thankful for the little things.
Or is that just me?
I used to write one line a day of things that I was grateful for. In every day life, I would find something that I am thankful for. It could be as little as the sun came out today after days of rain to big things like I got the promotion I’ve been waiting for today.
Then I stopped.
It was hard to keep up with. I was struggling to find the silver lining in things. I got tired of people telling me it happened for a reason. You’ll see!
With Thanksgiving in the horizon, I want to bring a little bit of that grateful attitude back. I know, I know,…]]></summary>

Title: Responce to ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot, or the Necessity to Write Our Own Histories’
Notes: This essay is a response to Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot, or the necessity to write our own histories which was posted to BC Counter Info on Nov 9th, 2024.
Source: Retrieved from https://bccounterinfo.org/2024/11/17/review-of-anarchists-in-the-blind-spot-or-the-necessity-to-get-an-editor/

 ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot’ has the posture of a disappointed lover who didn’t make it into their songwriter ex’s latest LP. None of the songs are about them, so they leave a scathing review. 
 The anonymous author argues that Yintah should have included the history of anarchist participation in the Wet’suwet’en struggle. I agree that the film is incomplete witho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A contradictory title from someone who lives in a country that is among the world's largest coffee consumers, and who loves a Swedish fika.
The title, of course, refers to the "Buy Me a Coffee" buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it's often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn't feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it's a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian "jantelagen" (Law of Jante). I don't know.
I don't blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it's nice to know that I don't "have to." And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you're ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I'll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why do I blog? Because I like to write.
That's my spontaneous answer.
And it's true—but far from the whole truth. It became obvious when I chose to write without blogging during the week.
I felt creatively stifled. As if everything I created was never really complete. A gallery with paintings lacking frames.
For me, blogging is so much more than publishing texts. I like to tinker with the design and format the texts with a "digital mentality." I like my blogging workflow and everything surrounding it.
I blog because I love blogging.

Me: "What do you mean? Like next week?"
Her: "No, like next round, when we do this again."
She'd meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn't have the heart to tell her there wouldn't be a next round. I said I didn't know, and that I'd have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she'd asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it's when we meet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been thinking back to that wonderful week I had in the summer when I had no social media on my phone. How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it'll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).
The issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn't an issue for me last time, this time I'm still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don't want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can't help but go to my phone whenever I'm bored, no matter how much I try to help it.
I've been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I've taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.]]></summary>

My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).
In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine a city without any strangers, where everything is shared, and everyone looks after each other. There are no shops, no money, and no danger at all. We think of the family as a group that practices “basic communism”: from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. Any family is thought to be protected by bonds of kinship from the cruel laws of the outside world. Unlike businesses, rarely will a family throw out a sick child or an elderly parent because they are no longer “revenue-generating assets.” More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times’ leading columnist, Thomas Friedman, has devised an answer to “How Trump Could Earn an Unexpected Place in History.”  Friedman believes there is an opportunity for Donald Trump to exert pressure on Israelis and Palestinians, which would help the president “find a place in the history books that you did not expect.”  This is part delusion, part illusion, and part confusion, all hallmarks of Friedman’s writings on the Israeli genocidal campaign in Gaza over the past year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any successful peace initiative will have to accept that the Ukraine conflict has no single bad guy. We do not recognize Putin’s view of NATO as a beast with encircling claws. At the same time, Russians can be forgiven for thinking that the Western narrative is not quite as defensive as it seems. “The spread of our values makes us safer” declared Tony Blair in Chicago in 1999, justifying NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia. This sets out the ground for forcible regime change when the opportunity offers. The underlying message is that democracy is the peaceful, dictatorship the warlike form of the state, so a war for democracy is necessarily a war for peace. Many Western analysts view the war in Ukraine as a war for regime change in Russia, which is why they cannot contemplate anything less than a Ukrainian victory. More

The liberal abreaction to Trump has revealed how thoroughly blind many have been to the vileness of Biden and his obedient circle of advisors and enforcers. If there was a secret Biden waiting until after the election to emerge, it was only a more malicious and baleful version of the Biden we’ve witnessed for the last four years.  More

The United Nations is responsible for this and its atrocious consequences, as John Saltford meticulously details in his account of the 1969 UN-orchestrated handover of West Papua to Indonesia in a so-called Act of Free Choice, which was nothing more than “a ridiculous and overtly manipulated denial of West Papuan rights”. Ever since, overt manipulation of the reality of the West Papuan people has been the order of the day in the international arena. The murderous farce is officially blessed as Indonesia has been a member of the UN Human Rights Council since 2006. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.
So when those times have occurred I've (we've more accurately) adopted what I refer to the "deer in the headlights" response to just about anything non-trivial.  "Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take."  Then you'll get asked to "ballpark it" because that's what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done "ahead of time" and look good.
Now, I've had good managers who totally didn't need this strategy, and I loved 'em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can't be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.]]></summary>

Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.
Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery's (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People here seem to be underestimating the advantages that Google gets just because of Chrome:
- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You'll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn't an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn't ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

But I never had anything to say, and so never used my shiny new website. Then I learned about Wordpress and paid for hosting so I could set up a pretty slick website with a hip theme.
