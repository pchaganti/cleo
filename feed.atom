        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key question in economic policy is how labor market tightness affects wage inflation and ultimately prices. In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.]]></summary>

I especially go back and forth on attribute inheritance (it can be disabled via the htmx.config.disableInheritance option)
Three of the criticisms boil down to the fact that client-side state doesn't always play well w/htmx swaps (especially the simple ones) which is absolutely true.
And events can get crazy.  They are powerful, but crazy and at times hard to debug.  Such is event-driven life.
The one thing I don't agree with is the default queuing mode: it is not to cancel an existing request and replace it.  Instead it is to keep the current request in flight and queue one and only one additional request.  I'd need to sit down w/them to see if they were misinterpreting something, using the hx-sync attribute to implement the behavior they mention, or if there is a bug.
I would also like to take this opportunity to market our mug for people who don't like htmx:

"You should try to write at least a little bit of music every day."
This is bad advice.
For a multitude of reasons that I won't get into here, I've had a terrible few months. Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I've still been making music, but it's been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can't come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven't had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you've figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.

Robert recently published a post to treat blogging like painting a house, which I think is super appropriate, considering I’ve been struggling with blogging lately. Plus LC and I were just talking about how to tackle painting our house and it’s ridiculously high ceilings.
If you're a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.
But what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.

But what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.
Starting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.
Let go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.
Begin with just one post. It doesn't have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.
When the weekend comes, maybe you'll sit down and create an "About" page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.
Step by step, you'll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It's your blog, you set the rules – no one else.
Soon, you'll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.

[Our comrade P. Kropotkin, having been asked by the Swedish Professor G. Steffen[1] to give his opinion upon the present war, gave it in a letter which we reproduce, with the additions he made to it in the three last paragraphs.]
 DEAR STEFFEN, — You ask my opinion’ about the war. I have expressed it on several occasions in France, and the present events, unfortunately, only reinforce it. I consider that the duty of every one who cherishes the ideals of human progress altogether, and especially those that were inscribed by the European proletarians on the banner of the International Working Men’s Associ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.
One guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I'm afraid it will end up the same way.
Writing forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.
Of course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).
One annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.
On the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.
While I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)
P.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?]]></summary>

I often hear that. Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don't know what to write about. My answer is always the same:
"Blog your way to the answer."
We can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.
Blog, blog, blog – that's the solution.
We might come to realize that we don't need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.
Or maybe we'll realize that blogging isn't our thing at all. Then at least we've tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn't waste our time ruminating about it.
The only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It's still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.
Many of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I'm really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog's small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.
Who knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don't have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:
Through blogging. Not through considering blogging.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is one reason I believe "right to repair" laws are so important. The environmental damage of producing the device is already done. Make it last as long as possible. Reduce, reuse... then recycle.
Re-using devices helps us also reduce the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we're not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?
Never the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I've been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5's, 7's, and 8's that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.
But tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I've been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It's as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!
And pick up a new hobby if you are able. Support your local tech geeks if you can!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several days after the Washington Post bogusly declared that Israel has recovered the “military primacy” that it lost a year ago, the New York Times goes one step further.  It obscenely proclaims that the Israeli military has regained its “stature.”  We’re are talking about a sophisticated and lethal military force that has been facing Arab adversaries who lack air power and air defense for the past 57 years.  Israel, a superpower in the Middle East, has been facing Arab states that have not threatened Israel since Egyptian President Anwar Sadat capitulated in Jerusalem 45 years ago.  As a result of that decision, Sadat lost his life to an assassin.

But the Hamas massacre that day gave him a welcome opportunity to execute a long=held Israeli plan. Its steps are to create a Greater Israel; destroy Hamas, Hezbollah and other adversaries in Iraq, Syria and Yemen; and quash Iran's budding nuclear program.  Over the past 12 months, that plan has unfolded successively in four principal locations: Gaza, the West Bank (and East Jerusalem), Lebanon and now Iran.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There arent any alternatives for major catastrophes that can top amplitude modulated radio.
if you are in a car fleeing for your life from a wildfire, major storm, or war, AM radio is available sometimes hundreds of miles from your location to provide timely instruction and lifesaving updates. if you need electricity for a radio, your car has fuel and can provide a radio signal to you for quite some time.
AM radio can be transmitted with a roll of wire and a relatively simple transciever from an FOB or refugee camp. digital radio requires codecs, licenses, and specialty equipment. Satellite radio may, or may not be available as the ground stations that power it require even more advanced transcievers and software to operate and could take months to repair if attacked or destroyed. Cellular towers require special beamforming antenna that can take months to rebuild or procure in an emergency and rely on an advanced system of transcievers and software to provide a signal.
its not Dolby quality, but if you need clean water and shelter it will guide you. Arguably you could mandate a VHF receiver in every car for FM based NOAA/EAS alerts, but AM is still cheaper.]]></summary>

I think this part is perhaps the silliest part of a very silly article. If you really like to put in a minimal effort then why on earth would you use Rust? If you want efficiency, memory management and a compiled modern language just use Go. Then you won’t even need anything but the standard library for what you want to do. Or… use Django as you suggest?
Yes, yes we use Rust in production because we thought it would be easier (well safer) to teach to interpreted language OOP developers than c/c++ but why on earth would you ever use it for the web unless you are a member of the cult?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I've meditated myself in periods. I'm actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I've tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I'm trying to say is that the "technique" isn't so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that "should be done" - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task 'meditation' on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.]]></summary>

I detest email spam and have been looking into tried & true solutions for obfuscating email addresses. Contact forms are great for hiding email addresses, but I don't love relying on yet another service for something so simple as email.
It turns out a simple CSS "display: none" blocks 100% of spam! I'll be using this method to list my email address moving forward — you can see how it looks on my About page.
The symbol substitution method seems to still be effective, but I want my email address to be easy to copy-paste.
Here are the HTML and CSS snippets for anyone interested in hiding their email address from spam bots.
HTML for email address
Add this to where you want your email to display. Update username and domain.com with your actual information.
<span class="email">username@<b>mail.</b>domain.com</span>

Theme CSS
span.email b {

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…]]></summary>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day. 
 Şehîd Tekoşer will always remind us of the fallen comrades,
 the beauty of struggle and the price of the defense of freedom.
 With our grief, we celebrate Lorenzo’s life …]]></summary>

Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven't liked, your posts?
Say hello to the "unlikely" button. It works like the standard button but doesn't display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post's popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: "☆ ";
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: "Like it?";
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: "★ ";
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: "Thank you!";
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}

Update: If you're not using the Bearming Theme or simply want a lighter version, ReedyBear has you covered. Thanks for the highlighting tip!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey: it's this story again. As someone who's around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I've always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama's sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also:
* I went to university and had a great time there
* I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly.
* I talk to women and have had romantic relationships.
* I've had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software.
* While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I'd say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.
I know DMD severity varies between patients, but I don't want this article to discourage people with DMD or with children that have DMD. It can be tough, but I think that modern treatments allow us to lead fairly rich lives outside of Warcraft.]]></summary>

He designed the “Batman Forever” website in 1995; it was visited by something like one-third of all Internet users.
He created the Web Standards Project, hugely influential in getting browser manufacturers to support standards rather than pee in the pool. And if you think cross-browser support today is rough, at the time you could reliably crash production browsers with valid CSS.
Never mind A List Apart, one of the best early mailing lists on the web, a kind of transitionary form between Usenet and forums/Discord. And A Book Apart, which published lots of high-quality stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To recap OpenAI's decisions over the past year:
* They burned up the hype for GPT-5 on 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can't quickly replicate.
* They dissolved the safety team.
* They switched to for profit and are poised to give Altman equity.
* All while hyping AGI more than ever.
All of this suggests to me that Altman is in short-term exit preparation mode, not planning for AGI or even GPT-5. If he had another next generation model on the way he wouldn't have let the media call his "discount GPT-4" and "tree of thought" models GPT-5. If he sincerely thought AGI was on the horizon he wouldn't be eyeing the exit, and he likely wouldn't have gotten rid of the superalignment team. His actions are best explained as those of a startup CEO who sees the hype cycle he's been riding coming to an end and is looking to exit before we hit the trough of disillusionment.
None of this is to say that AI hasn't already changed a lot about the world we live in and won't continue to change things more. We will eventually hit the slope of enlightenment, but my bet is that Altman will have exited by then.]]></summary>

Title: Communizing Society With Consumer Cooperatives
Date: September 28th, 2024

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…]]></summary>

 When I first started my journey as an anarchist, I was incredibly privileged in both my environment and upbringing. I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. 
 Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…]]></summary>

Let’s start at the beginning.
I’ve been writing for most of my life. As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way. Most of the time I was glad it was over, because I could finally stop the forced writing.
I also wrote for a fairly big gaming website for a couple of years, but I always dreaded writing long reviews. Enjoyment was far away.

Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.
Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.
Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do MRI work, and my gut is that none of the claims about dance vs. exercise would replicate. The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors' behavioral data doesn't show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...
The brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I'm referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don't reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors' claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p = .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p > .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.
In general, my priors on "we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period" are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Matt, great that you're participating here and I'm broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine's conduct.
However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites.
To be entirely blunt it's all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it's because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance.
If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE's conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It's not going to go away on its own.]]></summary>
