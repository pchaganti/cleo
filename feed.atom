        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twenty-five years ago this week, the streets of Seattle erupted into the kind of militant protest rarely seen in the US. Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink's anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom. More

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

此文就是记录从我调研到购买和使用的一系列功课的汇总，如果你也桌备购入，希望能够帮助到你。
购前
🤔 如果你要使用 Apple TV 就意味着……
在中国大陆地区，想要使用 Apple TV 还是需要一些技巧的，这里作为前提先列出来：
一个 Apple ID（为了体验最大化，并不推荐使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID）；
一台电视或一台显示器；
流畅的网络环境（为了体验最大化，最好是比较科学的网络条件）；
一条 HDMI2.0/2.1 连接线（随包装不会附赠）；
接下来，我会逐一讲解上述因素。
🍎 Apple ID
使用 Apple 设备和服务的基础因素。这里需要注意的是，由于Apple TV 并没有正式在中国大陆地区销售，并不推荐你使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 进行登录和使用，因为体验会收到最大程度的折损。
使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 登录时，Apple TV 将没有 App Store ，无法下载新的 App。同时预装的 Apple Music 也不会显示，即使该 Apple ID 已经订阅了中国大陆地区的 Apple Music 亦无法使用相关功能。但是，若先用其他地区的 Apple ID 登录，并在 APP Store 下载第三方 APP，再切换回中国大陆地区的 Apple ID，则已下载的第三方 APP 仍会保留。
所以，如果你想要正常体验 Apple TV 的原生各项服务，下载并享受其他第三方 App，请使用非大陆地区 Apple ID，我个人推荐使用美区 Apple ID。
📺 显示器/电视
最推荐的当然是一台电视，如果你有足够大的空间的话。否则，一台合适尺寸的显示器也是可以的。比较理想的是一台支持杜比视界的 4k 电视/显…]]></summary>

I've never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I've never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.
About a year ago the battery wasn't making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.
But then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device's release date1. So I'm stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.
And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly fun…]]></summary>

I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.
I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.
If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.]]></summary>

Let’s rewind a bit.
Thanksgiving 2022. We just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner and were relaxing, watching TV. Cocoa was lying on the couch when she suddenly started dry heaving, as if trying to throw up but with nothing to expel.
Strange.
We took her outside. She was on and off dry heaving. Nothing was coming out. Maybe she wanted to go use the bathroom. She walked very slowly, something clearly off. We brought her back inside, her little body feeling so tender.

The push at the state level for policies that focus on equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities will not end well for the gifted and talented communities.
Whenever I hear these people talk about their policies, I can’t help but recall Harrison Bergeron.
Focusing on equality of outcomes in a society that structurally does not afford equality of opportunities is a fool’s game that ends with Bergeron-esque levels of absurdity.
Imho, the only viable/main solution is to acknowledge that we all aren’t equal, we don’t all have access to the same opportunities, but as a country we can implement policies that lessen the imbalance.
Head Start is a good example.
Well-run gifted and talented programs in schools are also good examples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[我的公司距离我的家有 17km 距离，所以我每天会花单程 30-40mins 的时间开车通勤。今天简单说说我怎么度过这每天一个多小时的时间。
🎵 听音乐
通勤时间总是无聊的，我最早的时候是听歌。但是我这个人有一个毛病，很难听得进去新歌，但是我的收藏列表我又听烂了。所以现在通勤路上听音乐的频率较少，也会，但不多。
📻 听播客
我个人很喜欢听播客，不光在通勤的时候会听。但是我又很挑，对于信息和内容输出质量很低的播客我极少收听。所以我有一个白名单，一旦白名单的播客更新，我才会考虑听。所以，不会每天有一个小时的可收听量。
📚 听书
这个是我最近半个月养成的新习惯，起因是我在一些播客中听到过一些书籍的分享，但是我又没有很好的建立起读新书的习惯，所以我就瞅准了通勤这段时间。恰好微信读书又有听书模式，如果你是付费会员，可以想听歌一样的听书。这简直是一举多得，解决了我通勤路上恰好收听内容不足的隐患，又拓展了「阅读量」，还能完成微信读书的任务。

▲ 阅读了 13 天的成果
关于微信读书我准备后面找时间专门写一篇有趣的观察和思考，作为产品分析吧。
💬 总结
综上所述，我现在通勤路上依然会听歌和听播客，听歌比较少，听播客比听音乐稍多。这两者的区别在于听歌可以随时开播，听播客我需要提前甄选一下听的内容。如果两者都不想实施，我使用了微信读书的听书来补齐，这样又可以在这个通勤的时间段内拓展出一个内容输入的渠道。可喜可贺。]]></summary>

However, I think developers were already looking for reasons to stop interacting with Stack Overflow. LLMs have massive blind spots. New framework releases, yesterday's OS update, and niche languages are not in LLM training data. These are the problems where Stack Overflow should shine over AI. Yet traffic is declining even in these areas.
I recently found myself caught between these two worlds, trying to solve a problem too new for LLMs, but running into the exact community issues driving people away from Stack Overflow. My experience might shed some light on why developers are leaving, even when AI can't help them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a two-month writing hiatus, I'm back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.
Two weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I'm gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.
Transportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I've opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.
This isn't my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I'm visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I've been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic "konnichiwa"s.
My ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.
My professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I'll join a new workplace where I've already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I'm aware that I'm really lucky to have found such an environment, and I'm hopeful about building a long-term community here.]]></summary>

The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine.

Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today's newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I've always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it's no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado's thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.
If you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents. They're in Danish, but upload them to Claude or ChatGPT, and you'll have a much better source of information if you'd like to know more about the specifics and how the actual implementation is planned.

There’s a lot of not so great things happening in the world right now that we often forget to be thankful for the little things.
Or is that just me?
I used to write one line a day of things that I was grateful for. In every day life, I would find something that I am thankful for. It could be as little as the sun came out today after days of rain to big things like I got the promotion I’ve been waiting for today.
Then I stopped.
It was hard to keep up with. I was struggling to find the silver lining in things. I got tired of people telling me it happened for a reason. You’ll see!

 ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot’ has the posture of a disappointed lover who didn’t make it into their songwriter ex’s latest LP. None of the songs are about them, so they leave a scathing review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn't drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don't need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.]]></summary>

Why
前一段时间发现自己在浑噩过日子，并不是像一具行尸走肉，而是缺少自律的可持续的沉淀过程。熟悉我的朋友可能知道，我运营了一个名叫不求甚解的 Telegram 频道，这是我的得意之作，也是我的心头之痛。为什么这么讲，得意的是因为我在运营这个介质的同时获得了诸多关注和肯定，难过的是我经常缺少更新它的动力。
但是我经常思考。是的，作为一个 INTJ-A，我是非常喜欢思考，人生经历了 30 多年，到达了现在的阶段，我已经养成了时刻思考的能力和习惯，但是我缺少系统化沉淀的动作。
所以，我准备开启我人生的新阶段 ———— 养成自律的思考到沉淀的链路。
How
我准备按照时间周期的维度产出一些内容：
[Daily] 每天在这里写日记，哪怕是流水账；
[Weekly] Telegram 频道一周至少 3 更；
[Monthly] 召集思想同频的小伙伴录制播客。
Specially
需要说明几点，以上产出的内容，都是为了我自己，如果能帮助到此刻正在看的你，我很荣幸，但这不是我的职责以及初心。
最后，除了上面那些看起来很高大上的原因外，另外一个让我开始想要系统化记录自己生活的原因，是因为我看到了我的朋友 61 正在这么做，能够通过他的内容中感受到他对生活的热爱以及快乐，我也同样需要这些。
以上，祝各位都好。]]></summary>

- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.
- One was in an industry that didn't need "Webscale" (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.
Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.
The place I'm at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.
I don't fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that's less successful that removing complexity in the first place.]]></summary>

The title, of course, refers to the "Buy Me a Coffee" buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it's often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn't feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it's a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian "jantelagen" (Law of Jante). I don't know.
I don't blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it's nice to know that I don't "have to." And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you're ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I'll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I quit my FAANG job yesterday to join a fully remote company. I took a >50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I've cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don't hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal.
Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, "If you don't like it, find another place to work". The first good advice I've heard from them in 5 years.]]></summary>

Me: "What do you mean? Like next week?"
Her: "No, like next round, when we do this again."
She'd meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn't have the heart to tell her there wouldn't be a next round. I said I didn't know, and that I'd have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she'd asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it's when we meet.
