        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30's) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.
I just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other's people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn't out to impress anybody, I just became "Mr. Dependable" on any of the teams I worked on.
This was the approach that changed everything.
Now, some ten years later? I'm never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that's it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.
I found out that if you don't protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You'll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.
Protect yourself. Protect your sanity. Once you lose it, like OP said, it's very, very hard to get back.
I hope this helps someone else struggling to break this cycle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got back from getting my hair lopped at Mastercuts. $30. And let me tell you, this lady got it right, and I didn't have to spend a small fortune.
I stopped and got a cream cheese and lox bagel with a blood orange Pelligrino around the corner from the salon. I sat by the window, and people watched, hurrying to and from their office jobs high in the sky.
The bagel was alright, although I think I got spoiled living at Bathurst and Lawrence, a predominantly Jewish community, with their spectacular bagels, that now, every other bagel shop, pales in comparison. My people know how to make a mean cream cheese and lox.
I've been up to my neck in job search.
There's one in particular I'm hoping will call back. Not because I like the job, but because it's close to home, and i can do the job with my eyes closed.

I'm still spending most of my writing efforts on my email blog.
I wrote two letters: end of august diary, and deep affection. Hope you liked them <3
If you're a regular reader of my blog (hi ilu 🦄), consider signing up!
This past week, I've been trying out Substack. I know, I know, a lot of you don't like the platform for various reasons. I'm with you on quite a few of them.
But. BUT. What a pleasure it is to write in their editor. Things WORK! Can you even imagine?
There are no weird formatting issues. I can easily upload a picture and write a caption easy peasy. Bullet lists don't go all wonky when i hit publish.
But on the flip side, it doesn't feel like my writing home. The writers use the same writerly language, discussing Important Things in highly sophisticated, educated, long-form essays.
I feel like the outcast in the cafeteria sitting by myself eating a wet sandwich my mom made me.
on another note...

Like most people in the States after I turned eighteen I started
splitting time between home and school, or work, or wherever I
happened to be at the time. At first I didn't go home very often
because I felt stagnant there, lost, and my parents' presence
exhausted me. I found ways to leave school days later than everyone
else and ways to return early from break. Most years I think I wanted

of my life I wanted to be neither where I was nor at home. So it is

If you hold sand too tightly, it will slip through your fingers.
It's often like that when we cling too tightly to things. Relationships, status, possessions — they risk slipping through our hands. The more value we place on them, the more we cling. It's almost as if we're inviting a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Moreover, we squeeze the joy and beauty out of what we hold dear when our grip is too strong. What we have here and now is neglected by thoughts of what we "must do" to keep it, and what might happen if we don't do it. We stand with one foot in the present and the other in an imaginary future.
We can never know what the future holds. We can secure things as much as possible, nothing wrong with that, but we must be open to the fact that life is, after all, transient and unpredictable. There is a beauty in that too, if we accept that inevitable truth. We become more open and receptive to our surroundings.
When we let go, we begin to let in.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle
Kahle founded the Archive in the nineties, in the midst of the fairly determined attempts at that time to either delay or even re-engineer the early Internet to be more respectful of existing intellectual property and decency laws.
We inherit a searchable, saveable web, because of the work done then to establish the norm that the Internet itself should exist, and that open digital archives can exist, legally. Many many…]]></summary>

The most significant recent escalation in the ongoing Zionist real estate project, enabled by apartheid and genocide of the Palestinian people, occurred on October 7th, 2023, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s prison fence, carrying out a bloody incursion on Israeli military installations and border towns. Since, the Israel “Defense” Forces (IDF) have engaged in the offensive flattening of Gaza, destruction of its infrastructure, extensive land seizure and elimination, torture and expulsion of its Palestinian population.

This person was arguing that having an Indian name can be a hindrance when trying to do business online.
I don't think the issue is limited to Indians. I've worked with SaaS makers from mainland China who choose not to reveal they are from China and sometimes use alternate names online. They do this because of perceived negative stereotypes about quality and reliability that can come with a "Made in China" label.
It seems national stereotypes can also influence perceptions regardless of actual ability or experience. As someone with over a decade of professional experience working mostly with non-Indian folks, I've found that potential clients always fall into one of two camps -  those willing to fairly compensate based on skills and those expecting to pay less simply because I'm Indian.
As an Indian, it does sting to see the stereotyping. But defending it by pointing to the success of individuals like Naval Ravikant or Balaji Srinivasan doesn't address the root issue (I noticed this pattern on X).
Don't let ignorance ruin your day.]]></summary>

If IA had won, IA would be hailed as a cultural hero. They hit and they missed. Claiming Brewster Kahle is against "the people who work very hard to bring new books into being" is unfair.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This has been playing out for many years. And it's all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive's mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.
When IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:
The Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.
https://nwu.org/nwu-denounces-cdl/
When the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.
He also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see https://blog.archive.org/2023/12/15/brewster-kahle-appeal-st...). It's not. It's the logical outcome of one man's seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.
In addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society. I truly hope the organization can survive.]]></summary>

Basically, if 'acceptable' is so narrowly defined that you can't achieve it 100% of the time, why try even a little to conform?

The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.
They don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board.
Without talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.
I feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.
I mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.
There was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.
I missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.
So here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.
Side note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?]]></summary>

I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.
I love reading about landfills. I wish more environmentalists would be excited about engineering solving environmental ills and relied less on knee-jerk reactions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So obviously claiming that there's no good reason for process to read argv[0] is either demonstrating the author's ignorance or needs a much stronger defense; I'd be fascinated to hear how they think busybox should work on an OpenWrt box with a 16MB root filesystem.
However, I am willing to consider the discussion about whether there could be merit to restricting the ability to write that value; I could imagine a system that populated it only from the actual file name and did not allow it to be written by the parent process or the child process at runtime. The obvious place this still falls apart is that an attacker could just
    ln /bin/curl ./some\ other\ name

but there are sometimes security measures that we use even though they're less than 100% effective so it at least conceivable that this might be a trade off worth making.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This day didn't start off great. I was supposed to be working in the archipelago, which I love, but someone had forgotten to book a boat for me. I was supposed to be on the island at 8:30 AM, but the mistake meant I would arrive at 11:30 AM instead.
Three hours wasted, and I was supposed to visit six different clients. I could just see myself coming home very late, if I even managed to catch the last ferry back.
Once I got there, it turned out that all the houses were close to each other. The houses were also small, so each visit was short. When I was finished with the last customer, she offered to drive me back to the mainland in her boat.
The day ended with me finishing ridiculously early.
So, why am I telling you this? Because it's so incredibly stupid to paint scenarios in advance when we don't actually have a clue. We imagine how...
...the workday will be long.
...the job interview will go badly.
...the family dinner will be stressful.
...the date will be awkward.
...the weather will be a disaster.
And then it turns out in the end that those thoughts weren't accurate at all. The sun came out and during the job interview, it turned out that we had a mutual friend, so it felt very relaxed and good.
It's so much unnecessary time and energy that we spend trying to predict what hasn't happened yet. Things we can't possibly know in advance.
Of course, it's good and even necessary to plan certain things in advance. To do your research and prepare. But it easily gets out of hand or is used when it doesn't serve any sensible purpose.
We might tell ourselves that "you want to be prepared for the worst," but is that really a wise strategy? Isn't it better, sometimes, to face the future with an open mind and open arms? That attitude in itself might even increase the chance that it all ends in a surprisingly positive way.
Let’s embrace the unknown and see where it takes us.]]></summary>

Whenever we are separated, regardless for how long, I unconsciously begin a countdown in my mind until I see her again, even it it's just from the beginning of the work day until lunch. I've never known anyone as well as I know her. I can tell her mood from the sound of her footsteps as she descends the stairs from our bedroom into the living room. Neither of us ever attempt to hide an emotion from the other, so intune we are with each other's feelings.
My wife is a classic introvert. Our home is her haven, the place where she recharges her batteries. I long ago accepted the responsibility for answering every knock at the door and being the one to deal …]]></summary>

In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.]]></summary>

- It's your day to day project and you expect to be working in it for a long time.
Scenarios where grepping is more useful:
- Your language has #ifdef or equivalent syntax which does conditional compilation making syntactic tools incomplete.
- You just opened the project for the first time.
- It's in a language you don't daily drive (you write backend but have to delve in frontend code, it's a 3rd party library, it's configuration files, random json/xml files or data)
- You're editing or searching through documentation.
- You haven't even downloaded the project and are checking things out in github (or some similar site for your project).
- You're providing remote assistance to someone and you are not at your main development machine.
- You're remoting via SSH and have access to code there (say it's a python server).
Yes, an IDE will save you time daily driving. But there's no reason to sabotage all the other usecases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust and Javascript and Lisp all get extra points because they put a keyword in front of every function definition. Searching for “fn doTheThing” or “defun do-the-thing” ensures that you find the actual definition. Meanwhile C lacks any such keyword, so the best you can do is search for the name. That gets you a sea of callers with the declarations and definitions mixed in. Some C coding conventions have you split the definition into two lines, first the return type on a line followed by a second line that starts with the function name. It looks ugly, but at least you can search for “^doTheThing” to find just the definition(s).]]></summary>

But another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window, which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we're staring at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do "auto white balance" that skews the results. It's the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.
To address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller, or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.]]></summary>

You quickly end up on a color that's clearly not "blue" or "green" and you're unlikely to keep hitting "this is green" several times in a row, conceding that ok, fine, maybe this is blue, whatever. You're basically measuring how many times people are willing to click the same button in a row.
Edit: Possible improvements: changing the wording to "this is MORE green" and "this is MORE blue" and randomizing the order in which they are shown, somehow. I realize you're just doing some kind of binary search, narrowing the color range.
This is not to mention color calibration of your monitor, or your eyes adjusting / fatiguing to the bold color over time...]]></summary>

Internally we use Apify[2] and Firecrawl[3] for Magic Loops[4] that run in the cloud, both of which have options for simplifying pages built-in, but for our Chrome Extension we use dom-to-semantic-markdown.
Similar to the article, we're currently exploring a user-assisted flow to generate XPaths for a given site, which we can then use to extract specific elements before hitting the LLM.
By simplifying the "problem" we've had decent success, even with GPT-4o mini.

My projects span from math, to programming, to pinball repair, to amateur radio, to gardening, to mycology, to who knows what else. I personally enjoy the process of bike-shedding and endlessly exploring the solution space for a problem. That said, there is a point where you need to make hard decisions and button up projects.
As long as I don't care what project gets completed at what time, I've found a little trick to broadly move the needle. I jokingly call it "Sol's fast five" but the name is actually pretty on point.
I take a step back, look around me, and pick out the first five things I can reasonably achieve in less then a day prioritizing things where I have all the tools and materials at hand. These 5 things are never entire projects, the goal is to maximally decompose the projects until each action is as close to trivial as possible.
Once I have my list of 5 things I stop thinking about anything else and strictly work towards those 5 goals. There is a sense of relief in having reduced the scope and the tasks tend to be finished very quickly. Checking them off the list always feels good.
Once I have completed my 5 items I start a new list and pick out the next five items. This can feel like a huge reward.
I've used this system to great effect in the past few years.]]></summary>

I'd make an honest attempt but move on from problems quickly if I got stuck. I'd rarely get much done. Then, I'd do my best to get a good night's sleep (at least 7.5 hours quality sleep). In the morning I'd try the problems again first thing after coffee, and frequently found that I could do a significant portion of the problems, or at least make headway. This might be biased by the fact that I'm really much more of a morning person to begin with, but I know several people who use this strategy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was once so angry that I reached this current level of understanding English, the level you see right now.
It was in the summer of 2016.
I wasn’t particularly angry at the time, until a certain event occurred. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.
During that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was "Frankenstein") and tried to read it.
I didn’t have my laptop, internet, TV, or even a paper dictionary at the time. I was furious and struggled to read the book.

But I did not know about the technicalities (wtf is RSS?) and the culture of blogging. And although it took some time to set this whole endeavor up2, it is the culture-thing that is the hardest for me.
I am used to Twitter and Bluesky, where posts have to be short and draw attention. This combination rewards posts that say divisive shit3 and punishes those that are nuanced and complex. It is easier to wish death onto some asshole politician than to explain what they did wrong. If you want to write something personal or sincere you have to meme and/or bury it under ironic detachment.

UPDATE: Herman just added a comment in the nolt suggestion that locations are now removed, and there is a corresponding commit.
A new uploaded photo shows that EXIF metadata (including location) is now removed:

Thanks Herman for the fast work! 💨
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.
