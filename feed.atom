Title: Anarchism is about individuals
Date: 1986
Notes: From the 1986 centenary issue of Freedom, pp. 56–57
Source: Retrieved on 2024-06-21 from https://files.libcom.org/files/freedom-centenary.pdf

 There is no such thing as human society. 
 A lot of muddled thinking rests on the error that because ‘society’ is a useful noun, it must refer to a thing. It is one of those nouns like ‘journey’ and ‘tennis’, which refers not to a thing but to a relationship between things. The statement ‘human society exists’ is simply a less cumbersome way of saying ‘human individuals relate to each other in certain complicated ways’. The question, ‘what is the purpose of human society?’ means the same as, ‘why do human individuals associate in the way they do?’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - author here.
This is a big question tbh and the lack of a succession plan is a function of many things:
1. This was my dad's baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one's mortality which I also believe was difficult for him.
2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering/science of the company made us a non-starter.
3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession/exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly.
There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I've thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those "play the cards you're dealt" kind of situations.
Thanks for reading.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It absolutely melts my mind every time I come across the two facts that:
- People experience their thoughts very differently
- We all secretly believe that deep down, everyone experiences thought like we do.
I've never really had a strong internal monologue when thinking, so my assumption would always be that of course, thinking isn't very linguistic (even if we can use it as a tool while thinking).
It seems like there's a large number of people who experience their thought exclusively as language.
That sounds absolutely nuts to me, but I've heard people say the exact same in reverse. Even more fringe is that there's a sizable number of people who when thinking about words (i.e. remembering names) visualize their words as text. What!? I can't imagine that anymore than I can imagine how a jellyfish feels?

Intro
I have been “delving” into jax and einsum notation lately in my quest to become a shape-rotator.
This post is divided into two parts. In the first part, we go through einsum notation basics. The second part is about understanding simple transformer code in jax which uses a lot of einsum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no greater folly of contemporary human society than the purposeful restriction of such vast and easily shareable repositories of knowledge. Perhaps these schemes made sense in the past but with the advent of the internet and independent groups willing to fund all hosting fees, we should move to models of publishing that do not require this restriction of information. Library genesis exists but necessarily must hide and create some friction in the discovery process. A legally unencumbered free library of all books for all people would be the greatest achievement in all of human history. We prevent this achievement due to our attachment to a specific economic system that serves as the current means of financially supporting authors. We must build alternatives to for-profit publishing, and the only resilient and widely acceptable system I can imagine is one where every community owns and controls the means of production upon which they depend for their survival. In such an economic system, the need for automation would be obvious and once implemented, all people would receive the benefits of automation. This would include such a wide allowance for leisure and free time that authors would no longer need to restrict access to their books to extract profits from their value their shared knowledge creates. All people would be free to do what they will.
It would take great effort to build such a system, but open source and digital repositories of machine designs would ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The effort would still be substantial, but what hangs in the balance is the opportunity to assure the freedom of all people and the creation of the most significant repository of knowledge humanity has ever conceived of. If we succeed it will be our greatest achievement as a species.]]></summary>

Negatives:

Java has evolved significantly since the release of Java 8 in 2014. Java 17, released in 2021, brings a host of new features and improvements that can enhance your code's readability, maintainability, and performance. This article will guide you through the key features introduced between Java 8 and Java 17, providing examples of how to migrate your code to take advantage of these new capabilities.
Sealed Classes
Java 17 introduces sealed classes, a powerful feature that enhances Java's object-oriented programming model and works seamlessly with pattern matching in switch expressions.
New Syntax:
The sealed keyword declares a sealed class or interface, and the permits clause specifies allowed subclasses:

People- First of all, I don't know if I would be writing this without my brother, Arun. He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I've learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.
The war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I've read not because of it's writing but because if it's relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.
Brandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It's such a perfect series. Then there's the Stormlight Archive and it's huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).
Haikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It's about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.
It just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it's all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.
Naval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you've been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He's everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.]]></summary>

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I heard there was a heatwave going on across the country right now.
I spent quite a few years in the Middle East (in my namesake city) where heat is the norm. I grew up in the East Coast (of the US), where we had 4 seasons, and summers were hot and humid. Now, living in a specific part of the West Coast where summers rarely hit above 70F/21.1C (and rarely humid), we are in our own little cocoon. Like right now, it’s 66F/18.89C (1:52pm).
I’ve been sensitive to temperature (and weather changes in general) for as long as I can remember. High temperatures and barometric pressure changes are two big migraine triggers. So if it’s too hot, raining, or humid… chances are, I’ll be out of commission, or least somewhat more miserable than an average person.
I didn’t know much about San Francisco (and Bay Area in general) prior to moving here 5+ years ago. I think in some ways, I just got lucky. I have a love/hate relationship with this city (more on that later), but in some ways, I think this is where I’m meant to be.
You see…it doesn’t rain here often. We have our rainy season end of the year / a few months into the new year, but that’s pretty much it. In the areas I’ve lived in (and currently live in), it rarely gets hot. The more inland you go, the hotter it could get. Thankfully, the area we are in only gets hot a few weeks in the year. It saves me from suffering too often due to high temperatures.
And so, I’m sending cooling vibes and energy to all those melting in other parts of the country right now. We’ll hit 77F/25C this weekend, and 80F/26.67C at some point next week. Although it may seem mild to many, it’s not something my body is accustomed to anymore.
Anyways, please don’t hate me for writing this. I feel for those struggling right now with the heat, and I really do wish I could share a little bit of our cooling breeze your way.

I'm surprised that someone had trouble serving a subpoena on Facebook.
Looking up "Meta" in California Corporation Search brings up everything with "Metal" in it, which is a hassle. Their actual company name is "Meta Platforms, Incorporated". Search for "Meta Platforms" here.[1] California company registration #2711108.
Subpoenas are sent, using a process server, to their registered agent,
which is Corporation Service Company in Sacramento, a business which exists to receive subpoenas for other companies. And, conveniently, there are process serving companies with offices in the same building, and you can find them by searching for the address of CSC and "process server", then ignoring the spam results.
Most small claims court web sites explain all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had a nostalgic moment in my exam hall. It was so quiet except for the sound of the ceiling fan and people's footsteps outside. I was looking at the wall clock 45 minutes into my exam (that's what I do in exam halls). This particular time, it brought back memories of my childhood (like in 5th or 6th grade) when I used to play Monopoly with my friends during power cuts.
Another memory that recently surfaced depicted my school at 3:30 PM when classes would be over, and there would be clamoring in the corridor until we went to the parking lot. This was triggered by people chatting in front of the exam halls. There is a certain comfort in these noises.
Savor these moments when they happen, but don't be jailed by them. Remember, time is a cruel mistress who will make you forget the struggles and just remember the good parts.
It's like what Andy says in The Office: "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them."]]></summary>

Its nice to escape from the career you've had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you've lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn't that difficult. You certainly don't need "millions in equipment". Its exactly what I did.
I found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much 'smaller' scale. My company is small and work demands don't dominate my life. I have balance.
This year I've planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. "touching grass" is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens.]]></summary>

That is, there was a big desire around that time period to "build it how the big successful companies built it." But since then, a lot of us have realized that complexity isn't necessary for 99% of companies. When you couple that with hardware and standard databases getting much better, there are just fewer and fewer companies who need all of these "scalability tricks".

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning.

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides.

A little smile. A thumbs up. A "tell the chef the food was delicious".
We don't need to exaggerate. We don't have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.
But we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.
If we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…]]></summary>

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(ARC Prize co-founder here).
Ryan's work is legitimately interesting and novel "LLM reasoning" research! The core idea:
> get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s)
Roughly, he's implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we'd love to see more of.
A couple important notes:
1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).
2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn't been validated or scrutinized yet.
All said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We'll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard
EDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this]]></summary>

It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they're working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.

"Oooo, this cancellation fee will really help our retention, which will look really good on my annual review." "Making Photoshop subscription only will do amazing things for our revenue."
When you have complete market dominance, you have little opportunity for growth. If your employees and investors have an insatiable need for growth, you have to try anyway, and that's where things fall apart. The #1 threat to your magical money faucet is something replacing your product as the photo editor of choice, and you should be 100% focused on making sure that doesn't happen. To do that, you need to be focused on keeping up quality, periodically adding the latest features, and making absolutely sure that the next generation of artists is coming up using your tool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember doing laser cooling of rubidium atoms in physics class. It's really cool how it works:
* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.
* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn't affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.
Rubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.]]></summary>
