        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minutes before I left home on Thursday one of my mom's coworkers pulled up on the driveway and handed me a plastic bag of zongzi as a going away gift. "Good luck with the move!" he said. "Go do what you love."
That last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom's framed this new career shift of mine.
A large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn't want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why's she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I'm not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?
In Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that "looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything." I've been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I'm not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I'm nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I'm doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.]]></summary>

You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet. That should be a commonplace idea. And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.
It can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits. But how transformative are such programs?

Since 1897, Zionism has been the religious and political impetus behind what is now the nation-state of Israel, which, like the United States, is settled on the lives, land, and cultures of millions of Indigenous peoples. Although today’s Israel began as a refuge for European Jews fleeing the Holocaust, Zionism long ago broke out of its moral constraints to become a formidable geopolitical force that demands study. Which is why, in late 2023 America, the Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism was created. And why, because the Institute is fundamentally antizionist, it’s under attack for antisemitism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I'm not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there's just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It's an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it's not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's up?
You made it through the day. I'm proud of you. Seriously, I'm so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it's hard to look forward to anything when you're feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you'll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, "Someday I'll feel better. Someday I'll be alright." Remember, that "someday" comes one day at a time, and you'll get there. You will.
I'm proud of you. I'm very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

However, one of the things most of these “indie tools” lack is a search feature. I’ve written a separate post about it: The basic feature blogging platforms lack. 🔎
Well, it looks like things are about to change for us Bear bloggers. I just noticed that Herman's blog now has such a feature (can’t recall having seen it before). And it works elegantly. 🤩
Let's hope this is something we'll all have soon. Thank you in advance, Herman! ✌️
Update: Bear user Yordi made it possible to add your own (example). You can get yours here. Thank you, Yordi! 😎
Update 2: The search results only include links to posts where the search word is included in the title. Hopefully there will come a “true search feature” in the future.]]></summary>

Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.

Collaborating with nontechnical people is oddly my favorite part of doing MLE work right now. It wasn't the case when I did basic web/db stuff. They see me as a magician. I see them as voodoo priests and priestesses. When we get something trained up and forecasting that we both like, it's super fulfilling. I think for both sides.
Most of my modeling is healthcare related. I tease insights out of a monstrous data lake of claims, Rx, doctor notes, vital signs, diagnostic imagery, etc. What is also monstrous is how accessible this information is. HIPAA my left foot.
Since you seemed to be asking about the temporal realities, it's about 3 hours of meetings a week, probably another 3 doing task grooming/preparatory stuff, fixing some ETL problem, or doing a one-off query for the business, the rest is swimming around in the data trying to find a slight edge to forecast something that surprised us for a $million or two using our historical snapshots. It's like playing wheres waldo with math. And the waldo scene ends up being about 50TB or so in size. :D]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday nights in New York have an energy about them, one that's been easier for me to pick up on after arriving in the city midweek. I'm not used to it, like a river fish dumped in a tank. Everyone's dressed up in skin and mascara and waiting to go to the clubs and even though that life is not for me I love soaking in their anticipation on the subway platforms. Back when I worked abroad in that job I hated I remember writing something about how my soul left my body on Monday mornings and returned on Friday nights. I don't miss that feeling one bit, but I do sometimes think about that hunger for life I felt on Friday evenings, that burning desire to avenge the week of my life I sold to live for two days.

Oh and did I say that there are thousands of books a day released and there is nowhere you can self-promote stuff if you do not have social media, HN and reddit will also immediately block self-promotion even if relevant to the audience (I guess I can understand why).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe a bit off-topic, but I sure wish they'd do this for OneDrive! I installed Windows for personal use for the first time recently (although I use it exclusively at work) and it drove me ABSOLUTELY BONKERS that my home drive was mapping to C:\Users\atribecalledqst\OneDrive.
What I hated the most was that the File Explorer just calls the folders in there e.g. "Documents" and "Pictures" without showing the full path. So it was hard to figure out just where in the file system you were looking -- a major annoyance if you do any work in the command-line!
Even after switching OneDrive off and doing as much as I can to try and get rid of the OneDrive folder structure, I haven't been completely successful. You can make some -- but not all -- home folders (like Downloads, Documents, etc.) point directly to their place in the local user folder, but others, particularly Pictures, don't seem to be movable. Additionally, some programs still seem to want to use the OneDrive folder by default, like I think Office programs still do their best to use them.
In the grand scheme of things it's a small annoyance but god it annoys the shit out of me! I didn't ask for cloud backup and it drives me nuts they tried to force it on me!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having written an SSH server that is used in a few larger places, I find the perspective of enabling these features on a per-address basis by default in the future troubling. First, with IPv4 this will have the potential to increasingly penalize innocent bystanders as CGNs are deployed. Worst case, this will give bad actors the option to lock the original owner out of their own server if they have a botnet host in the same network. With IPv6 on the other hand, it is trivially easy to get a new IP, so the protection method described here will be completely ineffective.
From my experiments with several honeypots over a longer period of time, most of these attacks are dumb dictionary attacks. Unless you are using default everything (user, port, password), these attacks don't represent a significant threat and more targeted attacks won't be caught by this. (Please use SSH keys.)
I have seen experienced sysadmins create the test user with the password of "test" on a live server on port 22 because they were having an "autopilot moment". It got hacked within 20 minutes of going online and these mechanisms wouldn't have saved it, the attacker got in on the second or third try.
If you want to have a read about unsolved problems around SSH that should be addressed, Tatu Ylonen (the inventor of SSH) has written a paper about it in 2019: https://helda.helsinki.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/471f0ff...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It's so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels "less serious".
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don't worry so much about what people think of me. It's not that I don't care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I've come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can't please them all – and that's fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It's more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This looks great.
The authors randomly permute (i.e., shuffle) input tokens in training and add two positional encodings to each token: one with the token's position and another with the position of the token to be predicted. Otherwise, the model is a standard autoregressive GPT. The consequences of this seemingly "simple" modification are significant:
* The authors can prompt the trained model with part of a sequence and then decode the missing tokens, all at once, in parallel, regardless of order -- i.e., the model can in-fill in parallel.
* The authors can compute conditional probability densities for every missing token in a sequence, again in parallel, i.e., densities for all missing tokens at once.
* The authors propose a rejection-sampling method for generating in-fill tokens, again in parallel. Their method seems to work well in practice.
I've added this to my reading list. Thank you for sharing it on HN.]]></summary>

For those not following along at home, the Bartender author just sold it to some sketchy app mill. It’s an app that legitimately requires screen recording permissions to work. I trusted the old author’s reputation. I have zero trust in the own owner.
Ice isn’t as good yet. It’s not nearly so configurable. For example, you can either hide all icons or none. You can’t decide to show some of them all the time. That’s a bummer. I’ll still happily accept that trade off to replace Bartender, which I’d previously purchased several versions of. It’s dead to me.
Great job so far, Ice. I hope you keep improving!]]></summary>

Rasha was simply going about her day. She owned a beauty salon in Majd Al-Krum, a town in the Galilee. She was running routine errands when Israeli police pulled her over. Rasha is tall and elegant. She has the face of a model and long, shimmering black hair. She was wearing a sleek black dress. She tried to maintain her composure as Israeli police swarmed around her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The neoliberal attack on government expenditure in poorer countries was a key driver of international migration. Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy. More

Corruption because the CIA under Mike “Get Assange” Pompeo plotted to kidnap or murder the journalist and also, corruptly, listened in on his privileged conversations with his attorney in the Ecuadoran embassy. Corruption because bogus charges were cooked up against him by a pliant Swedish prosecutor, the sole purpose of which was to toss Assange into the clutches of the furious U.S. government. Assange did not rape those two women in Sweden, and the prosecutor eventually dropped the case. But the damage was done: to Assange’s reputation and to his freedom, because once he sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy, he was trapped. More

Most European countries have them and they are as uncontroversial as passports.
Countries without national ID cards are not especially more privacy minded : for the purpose of identity verification they just use alternative documents & processes that are less straightforward and at least as intrusive (e.g. driving licenses, utility bills and credit checks in the US and UK).
IMO it's much more honest to recognize that there's a legitimate need to be able to prove one's identity in a functioning society, and to build a dedicated system for that, instead of tying your existence as a citizen to your ability / willingness to drive a large piece of metal around.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They're all pretty great!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[> There's clearly a gap between imaginary noble okupas addressing housing crisis via occupation of unused bank property and reality of weed smoking anarchists and their collaborating deoccupying mafia harassing mostly not-so-rich middle class, who can't afford the security measures the rich can.
I had a friend who bought a house that needed a lot of work. Before he could get started on the remodel, someone broke in to the empty house, changed the locks, and started occupying it.
I remember being shocked that someone could do this and be protected under the law. He had to follow a formal eviction process, even though they broke into his house and never had any agreement. The perpetrators were known to the police as professional squatters and they advised him on all the things to avoid doing so they wouldn’t countersue him, which was mind blowing.
Even weirder was to watch the reaction on his social media when he posted the story. A lot of people, including many of his friends, jumped to defending squatter’s rights or trying to make some broader point about inequality.
There’s something about squatting that appeals to people who think it’s always a RobinHood situation: Stealing from the rich, giving to the poor. It’s more fun to imagine these people as noble warriors against an unjust society, rather than seem them as people abusing the laws for personal gain at the expense of random victims. Even here on HN there are comments trying to downplay the issue by portraying the victims as mostly wealthy or landlords, which are presumably acceptable victims to people who like these kind of narratives.]]></summary>

Sure, in the 1970s the cops could follow you around any time you were out in public. But they needed 6+ cops to provide round-the-clock surveillance, with an annual cost in the high six figures.
So the average citizen's privacy was protected not by law or high-minded ideals about privacy, but by simple numbers. There weren't enough cops to follow even 0.1% of the population.
But in the modern age of smartphones and license plate recognition and credit reference agencies? I think there's a strong argument to be made that we need new laws and new rights to reflect the new reality, where tracking people around the clock is several orders of magnitude cheaper.]]></summary>

The announcers laughing about the ship being "maybe held together by some nuts and bolts" and then it still pulled off the fucking landing burn!

Living in central Florida I cannot wait for the new launch facility to come online. We're going to have lines of spectators into the space coast like we did for the shuttle.
If any of you are heading to Disney World you should stop by the NASA Kennedy Visitor Complex, it is so well done and not that expensive (it takes less time than 1 line at Disney world to get to :) ). It has the original launch control room for Apollo that you can tour, a Saturn V rocket that is laid horizontally and you can walk under, the crew module for the moon landing.  My favorite part is the Atlantis shuttle suspended from the ceiling, they left it in its "raw" landed format with scorch marks and tiles, it looks absolutely amazing.]]></summary>

first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash

Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn't just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the

I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don't get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!]]></summary>

However, it is only from 2022 onwards that large models (LLM, LAM, and others) are gaining traction and attention worldwide. It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana's AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane's brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and "pay-to-win" games (which use NFTs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything is dependent on feedback loops. Video games/reels have short exciting feedback loops. That is why they are so addictive. Real life often has long feedback loops. Anything you do, it will take time to see the results.
You will have to grind hard at something and for a sufficiently long amount of time to achieve something meaningful. Yet if your brain is trained to enjoy short feedback loops it becomes hard to do something for long without seeing exciting results.
You either train yourself to enjoy long feedback loops or you shorten the loop through regular rewards. Maybe break down the huge task into small chunks.
It is often good to run both a long and short feedback loop on a task. The long loop keeps you aware of the bigger picture so the setbacks don't seem as bad. The short loop keeps you on track and gives that constant nudge in the right direction.
You are already in a feedback loop whether you are aware of it or not. Better off being in a feedback loop that helps you grow. One of your own making.]]></summary>

Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.]]></summary>

Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion.
