        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brother said he thought my blog was broken, so I decided to give it a makeover by creating a new theme. I call it Bearming, because every theme needs a fancy name, right?
Based on the default Bear theme, I aimed to create a clean theme with good readability. The appearance of the list of blog posts is inspired by the beautiful McLuhan theme.
I also wanted to make it easily customizable and expandable. The solution became what I've called 'Add-ons'. These are optional additions for special tweaks. Currently, there are three, with more to come:
Print styles
Highlighted tab
Upvote button
You can simply delete the ones you don't want to use. If you want to use the highlighted tab part, it works best if you only have Home, Blog, and any Page in your navigation. Example code:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image by Evgeniy Smersh.
Any rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.

 Fluctuations within a continuum can be generated from diverging narratives. Uncertain climes, alternative timelines. Chronoflipping, retroswitching, taleshifting. An alterverse created via timeforge. Terra incognita.
 Narratives serve the function of temporal modulators, unbound by the shackles of progress and linearity. Vectors of radivergence. Distorting, disrupting, and corrupting conventional chronologies, conduits to alternative realities proliferate with every shift in narrative azimuth. Each story is a potential rupture in the continuum of time, a machinic assemblage capable of bearing a plethora of parallel existences. Through an intricate tango b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read that Cole has been experimenting with blogging from his iPhone. He says:
Using my iPhone to write blog posts feels more casual and personable. It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.
Sounds wonderful!
For me, it’s the opposite. When I write on my phone, I stop and “overthink” things. I lose the flow I crave, just letting the thoughts flow onto the page. That’s why I can’t write in English either. It becomes awkwardly stilted.
I've tried a bunch of different ways to write, and I've figured out that writing in Swedish first is the way to go for me. I usually type it up on my computer, using TextEdit in full-screen, and then translate it. After that, I go through the text and edit some parts here and there.
It might sound like a lot of extra work, but I've actually grown to enjoy the process. It’s fun, interesting, and I'm learning a ton.
Whether we choose to write on a computer, phone, or in a notebook doesn’t matter. The important thing is that we find a setup that suits us. Besides, as Cole mentions, one doesn’t exclude the other.
Changing your method for a period can work wonders if writer’s block comes knocking.
Keep writing!]]></summary>

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…]]></summary>

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12. His trade was house painting and wallpaper hanging, but as we shall see, he was an able polemicist and poet; his words were a shot of adrenaline to ra…]]></summary>

 Until today, we knew that the mechanisms of repression of the state and capital were the army, the police, the schools, the psychiatric hospitals. Now we know that along with them have been added the Greek Cypriot ‘rapprochement’ state intellectuals and social-patriots. How else could we explain the fact that these gentlemen invite representatives from all the supposedly re-reunificationist areas to such a meeting — for represe…]]></summary>

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…]]></summary>

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…]]></summary>

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target. 
 Socialist anarchists, on the other hand, are willing to engage in legitimate work, seeing it …]]></summary>

MatchLabelKeys - Enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates
During a workload's (e.g., Deployment) rolling update, a cluster may have Pods from multiple versions at the same time.
However, the scheduler cannot distinguish between old and new versions based on the LabelSelector specified in PodAffinity or PodAntiAffinity. As a result, it will co-locate or disperse Pods regardless of their versions.
This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcome, for example:
New version Pods are co-located with old version Pods (PodAffinity), which will ev…]]></summary>

 Buddhist Anarchism is a synthesis of Anarchism from Buddhist Religion. Buddhism is a religion over 2,500 years old that teaches people to free themselves from Dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness) through practicing Sila, Samadhi and Panya (Virtue, Concentration and Wisdom) and achieving nibbana (enlightenment, freedom from dukkha).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Volumes in Kubernetes have been described by two attributes: their storage class, and
their capacity. The storage class is an immutable property of the volume, while the
capacity can be changed dynamically with volume
resize.
This complicates vertical scaling of workloads with volumes. While cloud providers and
storage vendors often offer volumes which allow specifying IO quality of service
(Performance) parameters like IOPS or throughput and tuning them as workloads operate,
Kubernetes has no API which allows changing them.
We are pleased to announce that the VolumeAttributesClass

alpha since Kubernetes 1.29, will be beta in 1.31. This provides a generic,
Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO.

but as clusters grow, the demands on the control plane can become a bottleneck.
A key challenge has been ensuring strongly consistent reads from the etcd datastore,
requiring resource-intensive quorum reads.
Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a major improvement:
consistent reads from cache, graduating to Beta in Kubernetes v1.31.
Why consistent reads matter
Consistent reads are essential for ensuring that Kubernetes components have an accurate view of the latest cluster state.
Guaranteeing consistent reads is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of Kubernetes operations,
enabling components to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

Comrade Creaghe is doing some more practical propaganda, by refusing to pay poor rates. He has taken the opportunity to explain his views on the subject, in the Sheffield Independent. His letter is so good and interesting that we reprint the whole of it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Kubernetes continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of
container orchestration, the community has decided to move cgroup v1 support
into maintenance mode in v1.31.
This shift aligns with the broader industry's move towards cgroup v2, offering
improved functionalities: including scalability and a more consistent interface.
Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let's take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for
maintaining system performance and ensuring that…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the "PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime" feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.
For more details, read about
Phase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least, that’s what I keep telling myself.
Or maybe something along the lines of: Life is too short to force yourself to finish a book you don’t even like.
I’m being a bit dramatic, but the sentiment remains the same. I’ve been in such a reading slump this summer and it's taking me forever to finish my current book. I’ve been struggling with finishing Daughter of Fire by Sofia Robleda for my Book club book, and thought it was just me. Our book club met yesterday and it was such a relief to hear that the others struggled as much as me. The only difference is… they finished, and I didn’t. I don’t typically have issues with historical fiction books, but this one is a struggle.
My current predicament: Do I continue reading it or do I start on our next book club pick?
I hate starting things, and not finishing them. I am only 77% through the book so I still have about a quarter of it left (1h10m). My heart is not into this book, the book club discussion already happened (and I was still able to participate)… so is there still a reason to finish it?
My list of Did Not Finish books is growing and it’s making me antsy. Outside of this book, I have the following shelved to one day finish (or maybe not)…
Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert
The Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden
One in a Millennial by Kate Kennedy (audiobook)
Interior Chinatown by Charles Yu
I’m trying to feel less guilty about these unfinished books. There are so many great books out there to spend my time on, and I shouldn’t feel bad putting away a book because I’m not enjoying it.
I just need to convince myself a little harder.

To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.]]></summary>

The following is a preliminary draft of the preface to the Turkish edition of my book Post-Anarchism and Psychoanalysis, which will be published in a few months.
 This book is the result of spoken improvisations that occurred during a strange period of wandering. I was removed from my position as Professor and Chair of Sociology at a major Russian university due in part to a renewed military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people reminisce about their exes when they hear sad, wistful songs. I reminisce about who I used to be (in a gifted kid burnout way, not a narcissistic way). The ghost of Valentine past, if you will.
I'm listening to NIKI's new album Buzz while working on my planned projects for one of my college organizations. It's taking me right back to high school, when I was stepping into my very first "real" leadership position in an executive committee.
Isn't it funny how things that were so serious to you get so much less so over time? I remember tripping over my words that day, feeling the heat crawl up my neck and ears when it was my turn to speak. Little fifteen-year-old me, surrounded by older girls I looked up to. I wanted so badly to impress them. When our director messaged me after the meeting to tell me I did great, I sagged with relief.
Now that I'm older than she was back then, I see how I must've looked to her: just a girl trying so hard to seem like she had it all under control. She must've known how important her encouragement was to me.
I loved what I did there. I stayed until I graduated high school. But when I started college, I wanted to leave it all behind me. I was tired and burned out, and it didn't seem like it having extracurriculars would help. Whether it was good instinct or a self-fulfilling prophecy, I was right. I changed in a bad way. I messed up everything I touched.
I've come a long way now from my disastrous freshman year. I've pulled up my grades. I've made a few good friends. My extracurriculars are starting to look up again—the entire catalyst of this post was the project presentation I was putting together. But I can't help it. I still miss who I used to be before all this, even though I know it's just my memories polishing themselves brighter than they really were. Nostalgia really is one hell of a drug.]]></summary>

Sketching Fortress-Europe
 Fortress-Europe means: strict guarding the sea and land borders of an imaginary, unified, “clean” European territory from the Others, the non-Europeans, those who live outside the fortress of supposed well-being. Fortress-Europe is the Dublin 2 law which forces immigrants to stay in their first country of arrival, trapping them there, destining them for deportation or an illegal journey. Fortress-Europe is the construction of visible (from the mines at Evros to Frontex) and invisible walls (see legal difficulties, minimal rights etc) that end up in deaths or deportations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes components use on-off switches called feature gates to manage the risk of adding a new feature.
The feature gate mechanism is what enables incremental graduation of a feature through the stages Alpha, Beta, and GA.
Kubernetes components, such as kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler, use the client-go library to interact with the API.
The same library is used across the Kubernetes ecosystem to build controllers, tools, webhooks, and more. client-go now includes
its own feature gating mechanism, giving developers and cluster administrators more control over how they adopt client features.
To learn more about feature gates in Kubernetes, visit Feature Gates.

In the absence of client-go feature gates, each new feature separated feature availability from enablement i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the weekend, I sat and fiddled with a new theme for Bear blog.
I'm not a professional designer and have no ambition to become one. I just think it's very fun and interesting to tinker with. Time slips away in an almost meditative state as small snippets of text magically transform the canvas.
Regardless of what we like or do for work, I think it's extremely important to have personal interests. Unfortunately, these are often the first things to go when we're struggling.
I've been in the darkest of places myself. One by one, I abandoned my interests. Not because I'd lost interest, but because I thought it would fix what was broken.
A fruitless attempt, of course, to try to fix the inside by messing with the outside. A downward spiral that accelerated into the bottomless depths with each interest I let go. In the end, they were all gone – and I felt worse than ever.
Fortunately, I got the help I needed. Slowly but surely, I began to climb out of the grave I'd dug for myself. As time passed, I started to reintroduce my interests, slowly and cautiously: designing, photography, movies…
It wasn’t a quick fix, that’s for sure, and not the only change I had to make. But things were heading in the right direction.
Now I feel better than in a long, long time –although it’s still like being on a crab fishing boat on the Bering Sea, not knowing when the next storm will hit.
If it weren't for rediscovering my love of my interests and letting them illuminate my life, I'd still be lost in the dark. My interests are lighthouses on the rough sea of life.]]></summary>
