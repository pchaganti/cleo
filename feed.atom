In any event, whoever is elected this November, a vast segment of the U.S. population will be deeply unhappy, in fact feel existentially threatened. That is the recipe for divisive clashes. More

From a Matter of Principle to a Matter of Tactics
 Anarchists who want to take action, when confronted with the choice of tactics, often default to large mass actions, like black bloc. Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…]]></summary>

A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To "bear the boredness". (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X = the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I stumbled across the Blaugust blogging challenge and thought it would be a good idea to participate. So I decided to join in.
"Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past."

I hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image by Heather Mount.
Between armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.
Profitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.

Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let's start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x = 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is "dimensionless" i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

I have a lot of things upcoming that I am absolutely dreading, but don’t have the power to change or control. For now, I am trying my best to put it aside and consider it a tomorrow/next week/next month problem. It’s causing me unnecessary stress, but I don’t know what else to do.

 On Isabelle Eberhardt's “Criminal” and Renzo Novatore's “Toward the Creative Nothing” 
 Quotes refer to the Eberhardt Press edition and the Venomous Butterfly Publications edition, respectively. 
Crime
 In “Criminal,” Isabelle Eberhardt's memoir of land colonization in Algeria written around the turn of the last century, the farmer Mohammed Achouri cuts an interesting figure. A “tall thin old man with the face of an ascetic, his hard features set in an expression of constant preoccupation”, a quiet character who stands “a bit apart from the others”, he is not a likely hero. Though he stands out, and in fact his inability to fit…]]></summary>

I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn't gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I'm so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I'd make my own version of it
Here's my anti-resume,
I don't specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I've come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don't follow clean code, I don't follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don't like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I do a lot of recreational coding. I don't care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it's beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don't like using iterators over loops, I don't do operator overloading, I don't like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I'm starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don't like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don't like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I'm not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That's it for now :)]]></summary>

de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle m’ont déçu.
Je suis parti en envolées lyriques.
Maintenant, j’ai envie d’agir.
J’ai déjà commencé, en réalité,

J’expérimente des trucs.
J’en ré-applique d’autres que j’avais laissés de côté.
Dans mes prochains articles,
je vais probablement me concentrer à nouveau
sur du plus "jeu de rôle".
Mais j'ai l'intuition que parler de créativité en général,
ça apporte aussi quelque chose.
Me contenter de parler "techniques de jeu de rôle",
c'est comme brûler une étape.
Donc... Je vais encore parler de moi.
