She did her best, given that my grandfather was old fashioned and had stopped her from going to school after she became twelve, although she was among the smartest in her class.
That Christmas she had bought me the brand new then Sinclair ZX81 personal computer. We were visiting the grandparents in a small village near Athens.
I spend the night by the fireplace with a small portable TV and the machine, typing in games published in the UK PC magazines of that time and occasionally watching the Chrstmas shows. Debugging my typos was the way I learned how programming works.
Nothing really interesting here, but I am remembering that night again and again so when I saw the prompt I felt I should share. Merry Christmas everyone.]]></summary>

Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor's house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys.  Sometimes we'd go out for Chinese food and a movie.
But my favorite was Christmas 1999.  My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too).  I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville.
I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon.  The timing lined up perfectly to see all three.  About 50 other people were there to do the same thing.  When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late.  This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies.
About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off.  Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies.
That was a great day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've made more friends more easily in my 40s than any other time in my life, and I'm a relatively quiet and disagreeable person.
Making connections with people you're around frequently is easy. The problem is that adult life doesn't throw you into those situations post-college outside of work.
Now it's on you. Find a group. Sports are the easiest. You will absolutely make strong, long lasting friendships if you play sports. It doesn't matter if you're athletic or talented.
You just gotta show up and see the same people every week over and over. If you're a reasonably well adjusted person (and even that sometimes doesn't matter) you will make friends.
Again, making connections and friends is easy. Being around the same people regularly is difficult. Solve that problem and the friendships will come with little effort.
I have found that people generally understand the value of friendship and are welcoming to newcomers. It's been a very refreshing surprise as I've gotten older.
Get out there!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have long been sympathetic to the concept of long cycles in capitalist production and accumulation. This is the idea that capitalist production moves in cycles, not just in booms and slumps every 8-10 years or so, but also there are longer periods of generally faster accumulation and output growth ie periods of relative prosperity followed by a periods of relatively slower accumulation and growth, with more recessions. These longer cycles or waves last around 50-60 years including the (...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This question reminds me of the first time I met a blind programmer.
I asked him how he managed to code, and he replied with something that stayed with me: a good programmer should organize software in such a way that every piece of code has a clear and logical place. The organization should be so intuitive that anyone could build a mental model of the structure and navigate it easily, even without seeing it.
It felt like something out of a Yoda or Mr. Miyagi lesson. Skeptical, I asked his colleagues if he was truly able to code or if he was just exaggerating. To my surprise, they told me not only was he capable, but he was the best programmer they had ever worked with. They said no one else came close to writing code as organized as his.
That conversation changed my perspective. Ever since, whenever I’m unsure where to place new code, I don’t think about DDD or any specific methodology. Instead, I try to follow the logic and structure of the project in a way that feels natural and easy to follow later.
Later in life, I met two other blind programmers and heard similar stories about their ability to produce well-organized code.
To bring this back to the original question: I view LSP/IDE features the same way those programmers view "visual aids." Code should be organized according to a clear and logical structure that makes it easy to navigate.
Relying on features like Ctrl+Click to find where things are located worries me. Why? Because it can mask structural flaws in the codebase. If we can't intuitively figure out where something belongs, that’s a sign the codebase lacks structure—and that should motivate us to refactor it.
Not only do I avoid using LSP features, but I’m also opposed to their use. While they can help with navigation, they may prevent developers from experiencing and addressing the underlying structural issues in their code.]]></summary>

But tariffs are simply the name of one kind of tax (on imported goods and services). So the GOP becomes both anti-tax and pro-tax. Likewise, the traditional party of minimal government, today’s GOP now favors massive subsidies to industries that big government will select as well as economic sanctions and bans on enterprises and whole countries that big government will select. Beyond the right-wing ideology and financial self-serving, Trump reflects deeper contradictions in the GOP’s evolution. More

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original answer to "why does FastMail use their own hardware" is that when I started the company in 1999 there weren't many options. I actually originally used a single bare metal server at Rackspace, which at that time was a small scrappy startup. IIRC it cost $70/month. There weren't really practical VPS or SaaS alternatives back then for what I needed.
Rob (the author of the linked article) joined a few months later, and when we got too big for our Rackspace server, we looked at the cost of buying something and doing colo instead. The biggest challenge was trying to convince a vendor to let me use my Australian credit card but ship the server to a US address (we decided to use NYI for colo, based in NY). It turned out that IBM were able to do that, so they got our business. Both IBM and NYI were great for handling remote hands and hardware issues, which obviously we couldn't do from Australia.
A little bit later Bron joined us, and he automated absolutely everything, so that we were able to just have NYI plug in a new machine and it would set itself up from scratch. This all just used regular Linux capabilities and simple open source tools, plus of course a whole lot of Perl.
As the fortunes of AWS et al rose and rose and rose, I kept looking at their pricing at features and kept wondering what I was missing. They seemed orders of magnitude more expensive for something that was more complex to manage and would have locked us into a specific vendor's tooling. But everyone seemed to be flocking to them.
To this day I still use bare metal servers for pretty much everything, and still love having the ability to use simple universally-applicable tools like plain Linux, Bash, Perl, Python, and SSH, to handle everything cheaply and reliably.
I've been doing some planning over the last couple of years on teaching a course on how to do all this, although I was worried that folks are too locked in to SaaS stuff -- but perhaps things are changing and there might be interest in that after all?...]]></summary>

Basically, it's got the dumbest and simplest things in it. Stuff like a lock and key, a glass of water and jug, common units of currency, a zipper, etc. It tests if you can do any of those common human tasks. Like pouring a glass of water, picking up coins from a flat surface (I chew off my nails so even an able person like me fails that), zip up a jacket, lock your own door, put on lipstick, etc.
We had hand prosthetics that could play Mozart at 5x speed on a baby grand, but could not pick up a silver dollar or zip a jacket even a little bit. To the patients, the hands were therefore about as useful as a metal hook (a common solution with amputees today, not just pirates!).
Again, a total aside here, but your comment just reminded me of that brown briefcase. Life, it turns out, is a lot more complex than we give it credit for. Even pouring the OJ can be, in rare cases, transcendent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficiency is now key.
~=$3400 per single task to meet human performance on this benchmark is a lot. Also it shows the bullets as "ARC-AGI-TUNED", which makes me think they did some undisclosed amount of fine-tuning (eg. via the API they showed off last week), so even more compute went into this task.
We can compare this roughly to a human doing ARC-AGI puzzles, where a human will take (high variance in my subjective experience) between 5 second and 5 minutes to solve the task.
(So i'd argue a human is at 0.03USD - 1.67USD per puzzle at 20USD/hr, and they include in their document an average mechancal turker at $2 USD task in their document)
Going the other direction: I am interpreting this result as human level reasoning now costs (approximately) 41k/hr to 2.5M/hr with current compute.
Super exciting that OpenAI pushed the compute out this far so we could see he O-series scaling continue and intersect humans on ARC, now we get to work towards making this economical!]]></summary>

A lot of people have criticized ARC as not being relevant or indicative of true reasoning, but I think it was exactly the right thing. The fact that scaled reasoning models are finally showing progress on ARC proves that what it measures really is relevant and important for reasoning.
It's obvious to everyone that these models can't perform as well as humans on everyday tasks despite blowout scores on the hardest tests we give to humans. Yet nobody could quantify exactly the ways the models were deficient. ARC is the best effort in that direction so far.
We don't need more "hard" benchmarks. What we need right now are "easy" benchmarks that these models nevertheless fail. I hope Francois has something good cooked up for ARC 2!]]></summary>

There’s an easier tell. It’s impossible because you can’t to get Google to help you at all about any account issues, never mind them being as proactive as to call you.
In other words if Google call you, it’s not Google.
It’s slightly depressing that there are probably more fake Google support staff than real ones.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is fascinating. But what's on display here is less of a nefarious plan from Spotify to replace famous Katy Perry with AI - instead we get to see something much more specific: a behind-the-scenes of how those endless chill/lo-fi/ambient playlists get created.
Which is something I've always wondered! How does the Lofi Girl channel on Youtube always have so much new music from artists I have never heard from?
The answer is surprising: real people and real instruments! (At least at the time of writing). Third-party stock music ("muzak") companies hiring underemployed jazz musicians to crank out a few dozen derivative songs every day to hack the algorithm.
> “Honestly, for most of this stuff, I just write out charts while lying on my back on the couch,” he explained. “And then once we have a critical mass, they organize a session and we play them. And it’s usually just like, one take, one take, one take, one take. You knock out like fifteen in an hour or two.” With the jazz musician’s particular group, the session typically includes a pianist, a bassist, and a drummer. An engineer from the studio will be there, and usually someone from the PFC partner company will come along, too—acting as a producer, giving light feedback, at times inching the musicians in a more playlist-friendly direction.”
I think there's an easy and obvious thing we can do - stop listening to playlists! Seek out named jazz artists. Listen to your local jazz station. Go to jazz shows.]]></summary>
