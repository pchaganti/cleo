Since Industrialization military power has been a function of three factors:
Technology.
Industrial Capacity.
Population.
As time goes buy population becomes less important (see, rise of drones), but it still matters. Think of it as something like Tech x IndCap x (Pop x .5).
America has a powerful military though most of the technology is one or two generations old. The general consensus is that Pakistan’s Chinese jets (themselves last gen tech) out-performed India’s Western jets.
At this point, China is ahead in about 80% of tech fields. China has 31% of world industrial capacity, and the US about 16%, meaning that China has about twice as much. Further China owns the entire supply chain for many of its technologies, whereas the US’s supply chai…]]></summary>

Some of the shit I read coming from the UK is just…it’s hard to believe it can be true, it’s so retarded. Britain is truly a shining example to the world of exactly how NOT to run a country, a benchmark in deindustrialization and how to drive a society to ruin while turning it into a Gestapo fun house at the same time on behalf of a genocidal foreign country. It takes true talent to make that possible.
Just before 7.15pm more than 20 uniformed police, some equipped with tasers, forced their way into Westminster Meeting House. They broke open the front door without warning or ringing the bell first, searching the whole building and arresting six women attending the meeting in a hired room.

[TW: Leah Litman, Michael Popok and Alex Aronson discuss the Supreme Court hearings on Friday 5-16-2025. This is ostensibly about birthright citizenship, but perhaps the more important issue is  whether US District courts can impose injunctions nationwide.

What the right wants from its followers is for them to be riven by hatred of any difference, thus making them easy to manipulate and willing to sell out their economic values in exchange for seeing brown people beaten, and women and trans people losing control over their own bodies.
What neoliberals want is for their followers to be convinced that each group, even each micro group, is on its own, unable to understand each other and thus that solidarity is impossible and all one can hope for is that some member of the identity group is allowed to join the elite, while most of all groups remain in poverty.
They’re very similar, really. In both cases hatred of other groups is inculcated as the core value, as a way of making manipulation easy and avoiding having to actually deal with broad issues of well being.
Both of these are variations on “divide and conquer”. It costs a lot less to give a few people something than to give many people something. “Want some women and minorities in power? Sure. Costs us almost nothing.”
“Want women to be forced to bear rape children and die in pregnancy due to lack of necessary abortions? Sure, costs us nothing. Our women can still get abortions.
“Want trans people excluded and denied health care? Sure, they’re a tiny part of the population and rich trans people will be fine.”
On the other hand giving everyone healthcare would cut a lot of profits. Giving everyone a liveable wage or assistance to those who can’t work or find jobs: that would cost a lot of profits.
“You can have anything you want, as long as it doesn’t make elites poorer.”
On that the right and center are unified.
