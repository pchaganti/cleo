But life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don&#x27;t know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend. Being able to take it slow in the morning, enough to think about things like this, is rare.
I&#x27;m alive. That&#x27;s something.</span>

                              <span>I recently read Kristin&#x27;s post where she notes that a lot of blogs have a very serious tone to them, and laughed because it was something I clocked too, at least in my own posting behavior recently!
I think I naturally like to reflect, but I&#x27;d noticed that whenever I came on here, I found myself endeavoring to write Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter1, because a lot of the posts I read were (either intentionally or naturally) Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I&#x27;m happy for the reminder to unclench. Honestly, I personally prefer reading the day-to-day, thesis-less stuff myself.2

                              <span>I recently came across a tweet that rubbed me the wrong way.
It stated: &quot;Mediocre people often have a clear tell: you&#x27;ll often see them hanging out with other mediocre people, probably because the A+ folks avoid them.&quot;
This reeks of the kind of elitist, self-congratulatory attitude that plagues certain circles. Who determines what makes someone &quot;mediocre&quot; or an &quot;A+&quot;? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.
Excellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don&#x27;t just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of &quot;A+ folks.&quot; The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.
Perhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...
 and I&#x27;ve all fallen for the bait.</span>

                              <span>Ugh, I threw up a little in my mouth just from the headline.
This constant tracking of kids is unnecessary and dangerous. Generations of kids survived without their parents needing to know their location at all times.
And yes, I totally admit, some kids (very few actually depending on the locale) didn&#x27;t survive. But we&#x27;ve traded this false sense of &quot;safety&quot; for kids that are so risk averse it is seriously negatively affecting their development. I highly recommend the writings of Jonathan Haidt - he not only has great arguments but also has a lot of data to back up his conclusions.
Kids don&#x27;t need more tech, they need less of it (and FWIW, most adults, too).</span>

                              <span>This mindset assumes that the only measure of success is monetary. If he left Google to try and get richer than staying at Google, then sure, he probably lost.
However, he kept trying again before job hunting or returning to big tech. This tells me the monetary factor was smaller than something else.
You mention the underrated educational experience in your last sentence, but there&#x27;s so much more than that. He was probably never worried about his autonomy, being laid off, working with (or for) people he didn&#x27;t want to work with, corporate politics, or anything else corporate bureaucracy introduces. This likely freed up his brain to be more creative and actually be used to 100% of its capacity.
I believe the obsession with TC in tech is highly problematic and there are a lot of talented folks optimizing for promotions via internal politics, rather than solving real problems for real people.
I also wish healthcare wasn&#x27;t tied to employment, but that&#x27;s a post for another time.</span>

                              <span>I could not hear anyone in any crowded situation. At middle age I thought my hearing was leaving. Yet every audiologist I went to said my hearing was fine. So  I found the best audiologist in my fairly large metro area, and scheduled a year in advance (the wait list was that long).
After a whole day of tests the audiologist comes in and says I have good news and bad news and good bad news. The good news is that my hearing was beyond great, it was at the level of a 5 year old. The bad news: I could hear so well I was unable to differentiate sound; my hearing hadn’t gotten worse, my brain’s ability to separate sound had. The good bad news is that my hearing would inevitably deteriorate, as all ours does, and for several years I’d be able hear in public places!
I think part of what has made this worse is that restaurant and public space designers have stopped thinking about sound. Most bars opened in the last 15 years have cement floors, very little sound insulation, and they’re based on the idea that you’re not having a good time unless your ears are ringing.
I’ve stopped patronizing these places if only because I literally cannot maintain conversations.</span>

                              <span>If the size could shrink to the size of a small earplug, I&#x27;d love to use this as a person who is not hearing-impaired (at least they couldn&#x27;t diagnose me with it, so now I&#x27;m not sure if their diagnostics sucks, or I&#x27;m just a normal person and others pretend better that they hear everything well).
In groups and with friends, it&#x27;s inevitable that you end up in a busy restaurant or a bar, and it always frustrates me that I don&#x27;t hear something, I ask the person to repeat only to not hear it again, usually because they repeat it at the same low level (considering the circumstances). Missing jokes and throwaway comments is even worse (&quot;hey what are you all laughing about, I didn&#x27;t hear it, could you repeat it for me like three times until I hear it&quot;).</span>

                              <span>&gt; They could have filed formal complaints, mandated increased scrutiny, handed off Sam&#x27;s responsibilities to other people, or threatened legal action.
I think you fundamentally misunderstand the role of the board of directors. It&#x27;s often been said that the board (of any company) has basically one job: to hire (and fire) the CEO. While that may be a slight exaggeration, the wisdom behind that quote is that things turn out badly when the board meddles in decisions of a company&#x27;s executive leadership - if they don&#x27;t like the decisions being made, they should replace the CEO, and that&#x27;s where their power lies.
You talk about &quot;filing formal complaints&quot; - what does this even mean?? They&#x27;re the board, who else would they file formal complaints to? &quot;Hand off Sam&#x27;s responsibilities to other people&quot;?? Again, any corporate governance expert would say that&#x27;s a recipe for disaster, never mind not even feasible the way corporate hierarchies work.
I&#x27;ve commented many times before that I think the way the board handled the Altman&#x27;s filing was, at best, woefully naive, and their communication at the time (even after he was fired) abysmal. But neither do I think it was some sort of &quot;coup&quot;, and your recommendations simply don&#x27;t make sense.</span>

                              <span>On April 31, 300 mm of rain fell in the mountains of Northern Rio Grande do Sul, causing dam breaks, landslides and submerging entire towns, leaving over 160 people dead as it headed south towards the Guaíba drainage basin, where all of the streams and rivers of the northern third of the state converge to enter into a river that runs directly past downtown Porto Alegre. Devastated by a huge flood in 1941, the City of Porto Alegre used Dutch technology to construct a huge dike, floodgate and pumping station system in the 1960s to prevent a similar tragedy from every happening again. As the water level in the Guaíba River surpassed the 3-meter mark during the first days of May, the public found out that some of the flood gates were missing rubber seals and bolts, and many had rusted into their tracks.

                              <span>Global capitalism has produced multiple intersecting crises that are intensifying conflict between and within states. These crises are a global economic slump; sharpening interimperial rivalry between the United States, China, and Russia; climate change; unprecedented global migration; and pandemics, of which COVID-19 is only the most recent example. These crises have undermined the political establishment, caused political polarization in most countries of the world, opening the door to the Right and the Left, and triggering waves of explosive yet episodic struggles from below. We have not witnessed such a period of crisis, conflict, wars, political instability, and revolts in decades. More

Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.</span>

                              <span>Some time ago, I delved into the unique advantages of the Theil index of inequality over the Gini index, when data is available. The Theil index offers a distinct advantage in its ability to provide a consistent quantitative deconstruction of inequality. It does so by utilizing various concepts such as class, region, gender, or any […]</span>

                              <span>I appreciate the author calling this out because creating an HTTP-redirect-to-HTTPS is something I&#x27;ll do almost without thinking about it. &quot;If it has HTTPS, I&#x27;ll set up an HTTP redirect.&quot; Now I know that I need to think about it before setting that up.
It also made me realize that cURL&#x27;s default to not redirect automatically is probably intentional and is a good default. Praise be to Daniel Stenberg for this choice when implementing cURL.</span>

Title: Solidarity and its Discontents?
Subtitle: Riots, Rebellion and Repression in Bristol 2011-2023

The media, the schools, the judges, the cops, politicians, surveillance, technology, work. All have their role to play in repression. [1]
 Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance. All these words are difficult to discuss because they combine personal experiences with repressive practices deliberatel…</span>

Killing King Abacus
 To Kill King Abacus is to create relations without measure. If we aim to destroy capitalism we cannot reproduce its necrophilic logic which reduces relationships to numbers. To Kill King Abacus is to destroy the social net which privileges mediated transactions and images over direct relations. Because money is a general equivalent and thus is nearly limitless in its applications, it conquers other signifiers of value; capitalism transforms other value systems into itself.

Title: Errico Malatesta: A Brief Biography
Date: 2020
Notes: A brief biographical statement used to preface a reader for the DSA LSC Political Education Working Group&#x27;s Malatesta Reader, which was used in a series of study circles in 2020 to explore Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Towards Anarchy,&quot; and &quot; An Anarchist Programme&quot;.

 Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Italy on 14 December 1853. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II . 
 Malatesta was introduced to Mazzinian Republicanism while studying medicine at …</span>

i watched laufey’s concert in manila today, may 28th, with my friends gabby and carmen.
i spent the whole day abuzz. it felt like everything fell right into place; i didn’t have much work that early morning because america was on a holiday. just an hour or two’s worth of tasks, then i was off to bed. i didn&#x27;t have to roll up to the venue half asleep.
i had brunch and then a smoothie, then i spent half the day putting my outfit together (see: looking through my mom&#x27;s closet for shoes).
gabby came over  with my stray kids merch (i brought bangchan with me to the concert) and we had a snack. carmen picked us up at 5:50pm and we ate at jollibee for a quick dinner. we arrived just as people were trickling into the concert hall.

                              <span>Recently, I came across a content creator who stated that the antidote to the overconsumption of media content or any sort of information is creation, and it struck a chord with me.
My name is Fatine, I am a 23-year-old student, and that is all you need to know for now.
My consumption tendencies are not unique to me. The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.
During these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.
&quot;Dump it&quot; is a self-discovery journey where I try to turn months of introspection and café conversations into concise paragraphs, backed by research.</span>

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.</span>

Introduction
 We stand now at a turning point, wherein many roads sprawl out in front of us. With unprecedented access to information, the atlas seems to lie within our hands.

Title: Native American Anarchism
Subtitle: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism
Date: 1932
Notes: What is meant by ‘Native American’ in the title is ‘local to America’, not ‘indigenous American’. The text undoubtedly still contains many OCR errors that are hard to find without reading the entire book. Finally, some text appears missing through errors in how the book was originally published, such as a paragraph ends naturally with a period at the end of page 112, but then begins half-way through a sentence at the beginning of page 113 (“exchange and recognized that money”).

Date: January 28 2024
Notes: This zine is a transcription of The No State Solution: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon, a live and recorded event which took place on January 22, 2024 in unceded Lekwungen territory in so-called occupied “Victoria, BC, Canada.” While a few grammatical errors have been fixed, we did our best to stay true to the original transcript of our speakers. It is not to be confused with Shuli Branson’s No State Soluton (2023).

 For Soren, 
who taught me the value of a leap. 
 “What we are dealing with here is another version of the Lacanian ‘il n’y a pas de rapport’: if, for Lacan, there is no sexual relationship, then, for Marxism proper, there is no relationship between economy and politics, no meta-language enabling us to grasp the two levels from the same neutral standpoint, although—or, rather, because—these two levels are inextricably intertwined.”

 Democracy has been the American religion since before the Revolution —from New England town halls to the multicultural democracy of Atlantic pirate ships. But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic? And if the tools of our democracy are not working to solve the rising crises we face, how can we —average citizens— make change happen? 
The Democracy Project tells the story of the resilience of the democratic spirit and the adaptability of the democratic idea. It offers a fresh take o…</span>

Title: Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis: Anarchist and Messiah
Date: 1971
Notes: In this historical essay the redeemer of the Dutch proletariat is reviewed against the background of his own day and age. Author Rudolf de Jong (born 1932) studied political and social-science, and since 1960 works at the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam. He has published books on the Spanish Civil War and articles on anarchism, Latin America, and Spain. A summary of his essay on Provos and anarchists appeared in the Autumn 1967 issue of Delta. The present article is translated by Elizabeth Wentholt-Haig.

                              <span>&gt; When told of my upcoming case, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand, being in perfect health, unaccustomed to suffering and therefore easily disconcerted by the thought of death, I was horrified. My attitude toward death was like that of a young person standing blindfolded and tied to a post, awaiting a volley from a firing squad. The whole concept made my blood run cold. Yet the case also aroused in me a feeling of relief. Simply put, there was no risk of malpractice, as my patient was already dead. Many anaesthesiologists have such self-centred thoughts when taking care of ASA 6 patients.
&gt; After we moved her from the gurney to the operating table, the doctors and nurses, so used to taking care of living patients, stared at one another stupidly, as if not knowing why they had come together or why they stood around the table.
Sorry this strikes me as embellishing for the case of writing a story.
Background: I was a neurosurgery resident at a level 1 trauma center. I was involved in determining brain death (though the final certification was by an attending surgeon). I worked closely with the transplant team. I declared (normal) cardiac death many times. I had many agonizing conversations with families about withdrawal of care.
Anesthesia is a 4 year residency. Even the 2nd year anesthesia residents I worked with had more of an awareness and lack of naivety that this author shows.
And the OR teams were much more prepared and professional than this. They knew what they had to do and why they had to do it.
If there are other physicians here, I would love to hear your opinions, but this whole piece strikes me as overwrought and full of embellishments to make a certain point.</span>

Sort of? See eg https://www.ft.com/content/dca3f034-bfe8-4f21-bcdc-2b274053f... for some graphs that show Europe vs anglophone countries in an obvious way. Obviously there are lots of differences between the countries, eg the specifics of their planning systems and economies. The US is different because of the big diversity of local governments – housing is more affordable lots of people outside of desirable cities, and places like Austin and Houston do build lots of homes and that seems to be a possible reason they haven’t grown like prices in California.
Credit costs have followed similar trends everywhere (obviously there are differences, especially in the US) and yet house prices have not followed similar trends but rather behaved differently in different places. I agree that when interest rates are lower you should expect to see higher prices, but that’s because interest rates change the price that a given income can afford. I don’t think interest rates are good at explaining the changes to affordability over time, or why affordability is different in different places.
Also, in your linked chart, you see something like 20% more dwellings per person in developed EU countries vs English-speaking countries, which doesn’t feel like no difference at all.
The issue in the article of affordability becoming worse across the US recently is probably interest rate related – prices change more slowly than interest rates, 30-year fixed rate mortgages mean rates change more slowly, and the higher rates mean existing mortgage-payers don’t want to move as they’ll lose their low rate, which reduces supply. I don’t know why prices are still up though – if interest rates being high was making housing unaffordable, one would expect prices to be down.</span>

In my experience, people &quot;intuitively&quot; jump to basically every conclusion besides this one. &quot;Greedy landlords&quot; or &quot;[favorite scapegoat] collusion&quot; are intuitive conclusions which are far more common than supply and demand.
&gt; Ask yourself, do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Britain, Ireland, etc, all have the same inability to build or is there maybe some other common cause?
Yes they do, to varying degrees. The Anglo land use regime is a disaster.</span>

Thank you. This middle ground between hyperscaler infrastructure and super simple web apps is where most of my career has been spent, yet the recent trend is to pretend like there are only two possible extremes: You’re either Facebook or you’re not doing anything complicated.
It has an unfortunate second order effect of convincing people that as soon as they encounter something more complicated than a simple web app, they need to adopt everything the hyperscalers do to solve it.
I wish we could spend more time discussing the middle ground rather than pretending it’s some sort of war between super simple or ultra complex.</span>

                              <span>People intuitively jump to the conclusion that the problem is caused by a lack of building. While more building would help, a lack of it isn&#x27;t the main cause of this problem.
Ask yourself, do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Britain, Ireland, etc, all have the same inability to build or is there maybe some other common cause?
In my view this is symptomatic of a more fundamental issue - global asset price inflation driven by a broken financial system (i.e. a system being artificially pumped up with cheap credit). Housing is just where the rubber hits the road and regular lives are directly effected. Just look at the tight correlation between the increase in the money supply and property prices.
For those who insist that the number of properties is inadequate, take a look at the numbers for each of the countries I mentioned in the first chart here: https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-cons... (Total number of dwellings per thousand inhabitants, 2022 and 2011).
This is a problem of underutilisation in my view. Too many properties are being used as investments and not as a primary residence.
Cheap credit causes an increase in demand. This is not demand for homes but additional &#x27;artificial&#x27; demand for properties as investments. Think short term rentals, second homes, land banked properties, etc. By definition, only investment properties can be underutilised - owner occupied homes are occupied! So in an environment that encourages property investment you will see more underutilisation.
What will cause prices to fall is higher interest rates. This is what has been happening in NZ.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Just use the normal session mechanism that comes with your web framework and that you were using before someone told you that Google uses jwt. It has stood the test of time and is probably fine.&quot;
You don&#x27;t need to be Facebook or Google to have more than one service in your infrastructure that needs to authenticate a user&#x27;s existing session without forcing the user to log in again. Sharing the session across multiple services is its own distributed systems problem with numerous security implications to be aware of and bearer tokens might be a good alternative.
If all you have is a single monolith web app that is the identity provider, makes all authentication decisions etc then yes, you don&#x27;t need JWTs probably. There is a huge gap between that and being Google/Facebook.
Apart from that, Google and Facebook don&#x27;t even use JWTs between the browser and backends after the initial login but actually do have some sort of distributed session concept last time I checked.</span>

                              <span>What a delightfully simple solution! I have to imagine if I were given this problem I would muck it all up with wristbands assigned to seats and a 5G/IOT network needing to be installed at every stadium and custom control logic needing to be written and customized for every stadium…
Whereas they just hook up an IR lamp and use the exact same lighting control procedures every stage tech knows blindfolded. Brilliant!</span>

                              <span>I’m not surprised — tattoo inks are not regulated and the colors are often formed with  toxic compounds (e.g. copper).  Then the needle avoids the protective barrier provided by the skin.
Ironically, while working on a drug program that involved intradermal injection, we needed to tattoo the injection site so we could find it later. The FDA was very demanding that both the procedure and more importantly to them the dye would not have any effect that might alter the body’s response to the compound under test.  We had to do a whole study just to validate this.
So the FDA is concerned about this issue for guinea pigs, but is barred from investigating the effect on humans.  All they can do is publish advice on their web site.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Authorize&quot; and &quot;Authenticate&quot; are excellent words. They go back to medieval times and haven&#x27;t changed meaning too much.
Everybody knows what an &quot;authority&quot; is. It means they have power or capability.
Everybody knows what authentic means. Something that is proven to be genuine.
The difference between the two concepts, as they are used in crypto systems are specific, important to get right, and also inherently intertwined, confusing, and subtle. I&#x27;m skeptical that changing the words would help.
It&#x27;s one of the many reasons we have the saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t roll your own crypto.&quot;
Trust and verification are just hard problems.</span>

                              <span>I live in Portugal and here the situation is outright ridiculous.
1. There are a ridiculous amount of abandoned properties, when I walk the streets of major cities, sometimes more than half of the buildings even in expensive areas are boarded-up.
2. Meanwhile I am afraid of being homeless soon, I lost my job recently, and the unemployment benefit I can receive is literally half of my rent. Thing is, there is no &quot;worse but cheaper&quot; place to move to. I already live in a &quot;0&quot; apartment, with the &quot;0&quot; referring to the number of rooms. The apartment is literally just an empty square with kitchen sink and bathroom stuff. I don&#x27;t even have my workstation anymore because literally there is no physical place for it inside the apartment.
People are like: &quot;Build more homes&quot;. Yet the amount of abandoned properties (by the way, this also include abandoned farmland! Government is upset that there are tons of that, and the result is land with zero management, with wildfires, poachers, drug traffickers...) is greater than the number of families needing.</span>

Financed by agribusiness, these advertisements portray a virtuous cycle, showcasing images of contented rural workers amidst soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar cane plantations, as well as happy urban families. They are all content because they can feed, clothe themselves, and fuel their cars, thanks to the agro-industry.

i didn&#x27;t. this must have been close to eight years ago. 

another friend, who first introduced me to haikyuu!!, quickly chimed in with a &quot;no, she asked me the exact same thing in history club. right before we watched magic mike xxl.&quot; that last bit could have been a joke, though it probably isn&#x27;t. regardless, i didn&#x27;t really remember it either. sophomore year was surprisingly busy for me, so i imagine i must have spent the rest of that period catching up on sleep.

                              <span>I have been listening to JRE for a long time. There are some common themes. Chimpanzee obsession, humans as biological boot-loaders for AI, and looking at people as babies.
The last one is a powerful idea. Basically in your day-to-day interaction when someone is being really difficult and mean, the first instinct is to be mean back to them. To put out the fire with fire. It never works out. A great idea is to pause and visualise them as babies. I personally visualise them as little kids throwing a fit.
How do you deal with such kids? You are gentle and firm as the situation requires. Maybe discipline them in the right way if needed. Look at their viewpoint and try to align incentives. Maybe you are in the wrong?
The point is, if a little kid is mean to you, you don&#x27;t take it personally. People (generally) are not mean to little kids back out of spite. You don&#x27;t hold grudges against them.
It is an awesome framework that does wonders for your peace of mind. Do give it a shot.</span>

I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor...

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>

hacks? Don&#x27;t tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.
First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>

                              <span>You may have noticed a proliferation of a new essayist archetype on the internet in recent years - the &quot;Mini Navals.&quot; Modeled after angel investor, entrepreneur, and philosopher Naval Ravikant, these mini me&#x27;s desperately want to become the next big thought leader by aping Naval&#x27;s pithy, maxim-filled style. Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress &quot;wisdom&quot; into a handful of tweets and blog posts.
Most Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval&#x27;s entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it&#x27;s usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.
