                              <span>For the longest time, I wanted to work in big tech. I got placed in one such company from campus placements. It was mostly due to my c programming skills and research work.
I am grateful for the role. I get to work on something I like. The people I work with are smart and kind. But it is just a job. Both to me and to the people I work with. One of the major perks that the HR department keeps repeating is a great work-life balance. You get time for yourself. That is very true.
Isn&#x27;t that great? You get paid well. Get enough time for a good social life and side projects. You can also fund these side projects with your salary.
Yes, but what about working in a startup? A place where a lot of super passionate people are going ham at what they do. To them, it is not a job but a mission. A sort of crazy cult. Filled with kind passionate nerds. Some place where you own part of the dream. Have equity.
It sounds nice. But such places are very rare. The startup scene in India is pretty horrible. I have heard some really bad stories. So many of the startups look cool on the outside. Have great pay even. But are horrible to work for. I have had friends experience this.
I also feel like I am not good enough for those truly cracked places yet. So I am happy where I am for now and just Skill maxxing. I want to feel like a really capable engineer. I see so many of them at my org. All are really kind and happy to guide me.
Sometimes these essays help me put my life in context and clear my thinking a lot. This was one of those.</span>

                              <span>The past year’s steady decline in nominal wage growth now appears in danger of stalling. Given ongoing uncertainty in Ukraine and the Middle East, this seems an opportune moment to revisit the conventional wisdom about the relationship between inflation and wages: if an unexpected increase in energy costs drives up the cost of living, will workers demand higher wages, reversing the recent moderation in wage growth? In new work with Justin Bloesch and Seung Joo Lee examining those concerns, our analysis shows that the pass-through of such inflationary shocks to wages is weak.</span>

In recent years, I’ve been focused on promoting diplomacy over war and exposing the role of giant weapons companies like Lockheed Martin and its allies in Congress and at the Pentagon as they push for a “military-first” foreign policy. I’ve worked at an alphabet soup of think tanks: the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), the World Policy Institute (WPI), the New America Foundation, the Center for International Policy (CIP), and my current institutional home, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft (QI).

                              <span>There&#x27;s 2 genders, right? We all know that.
Of course there is. You&#x27;re either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you&#x27;re a woman without said dangly bits.
But maybe there&#x27;s more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn&#x27;t feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it&#x27;s the opposite? Or something in between?
Honestly, I don&#x27;t give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I&#x27;ll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.
Look, it&#x27;s a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We&#x27;ve been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there&#x27;s been 2 genders. Male and female.
But in the last few decades there&#x27;s been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as &quot;him&quot; don&#x27;t get up on your high horse and start screaming &quot;YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!&quot;
I assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that&#x27;s fine. Tell me politely and I&#x27;ll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.
Irony is, if you&#x27;re not a dick about the whole thing, you&#x27;re far more likely to get people on-side. You&#x27;re always gonna get bigoted wankers, that&#x27;s par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn&#x27;t make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.
It just makes them human.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing this post as a break from working on the comic I have due at the end of the month. It&#x27;s an eighteen-page oneshot and my very first contribution to an anthology, which is honestly very exciting. Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.
Working on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don&#x27;t like inking, I half-ass shapes I don&#x27;t understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don&#x27;t really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing. Stuff is getting done!

                              <span>My throat hurts a little. I don’t know if this is because of the air quality here or because I’m actually getting sick, but I’m desperately hoping it’s not the latter. I stopped taking my immunosuppressants today and started drinking lots of juices high in vitamin C, despite research proving chugging OJ a rather ineffective method for warding off illness. (Something about all the sugar in it makes it hard for your body to absorb the Vitamin C, if I remember correctly.)
Traveling and getting sick go hand in hand for me. It’s as if arriving somewhere new triggers my immune system to self-immolate. When I visited New York in 2021 I lost my voice after a few days. I spent my first week in Latin America making chicken noodle soup and nursing myself back to health. My immune system’s never been …</span>

                              <span>I never really thought about it while growing up because I was raised in a religious family anyway and it&#x27;s just how I was used to people talking, but at this point I&#x27;ve been living in Japan for several years and I often notice that very normal phrases take on a religious persona when translated to English. For example we have this word yokatta which literally translates as &quot;it was good&quot;, but if you were to translate it normally to English as it&#x27;s used than it would come out as &quot;thank God&quot;. Or we have this other word kotoka which would be translated as &quot;God knows&quot; like &quot;God only knows how bored I am&quot; (なんて暇なことか). Also a lot of words in English are shortened versions of old phrases with religious significance like &quot;Goodbye&quot; coming from &quot;God be with ye&quot;, and a lot of set phrases or common expressions in English that people use all the time come straight from the Bible like &quot;a drop in the bucket&quot;, &quot;go the extra mile&quot;, &quot;by the skin of your teeth&quot;, &quot;the root of the matter&quot;, &quot;a labor of love&quot;, &quot;scapegoat&quot;, &quot;broken heart&quot;, &quot;eye for an eye&quot;, &quot;rise and shine&quot;, &quot;fall by the wayside&quot;, or &quot;a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;
I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a bad thing (and I don&#x27;t think it is), and Japanese has a lot of similar words or phrases which come from a religious origin too. It&#x27;s just kinda weird to notice in retrospect how in English-speaking countries everything is experienced through a Judeo-Christian lens, even if you&#x27;re an atheist.
Maybe that&#x27;s why Western society and Japanese society are so different. Or partly why, anyway.</span>

i try not to dredge up the past but looking back, it&#x27;s not that the issue was a matter of effort. sudden losses in the family and a general fear anyone else i cared about would fall ill aggravated a condition i was largely unaware of into rearing its big, ugly head. those days i&#x27;d lived not knowing 120 bpm was my resting average. and then the waitlists. and the forced leaves. and the absurd changes to curriculum. 

hard not to fault myself for ignoring my health. i mean, i was and still am obsessed with seeming invincible. who else was supposed to notice something was wrong? but at the very least, i probably would have graduated on time had the world not been actively folding in o…</span>

Household debt balances grew by $184 billion over the previous quarter, slightly less than the moderate growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. Housing debt balances grew by $206 billion. Auto loans saw a $9 billion increase, continuing their steady growth since the second quarter of 2020, while balances on other non-housing debts fell. Credit card balances fell by $14 billion, which is typical for the first quarter. However, an increasing number of borrowers are behind on credit card payments. In this post, we explore the relationship between credit card delinquency and changes in credit card “utilization rates.”</span>

                              <span>Fully onchain games are the only &quot;web3 games&quot; that I find interesting or worthwhile.
Like many of you, I have always been a gamer and have spent tens of thousands of hours exploring in-game worlds. These days, I&#x27;m too busy with my full-time job (helping people build interesting products using blockchains) to play much, and I tend to spend more time consuming content about games than playing them. I barely ever beat/100% a game like I used to. I still find myself driven to the aura that surrounds a game, often comprising of lore, community, roleplaying, extensive multi-party discussion and the creation of adjacent media.
I understand that this opening statement might be controversial, but I have seen enough of the behind-the-scenes of web3 gaming (or its name-of-the-month; I&#x27;m glad we dropp…</span>

                              <span>Open AI released a new update. You can now talk to your computers just like a human. Low latency. More responsive. It got me thinking about how I talk to computers.
The way I do it is more intimate. I am a low-level programmer. I write firmware code in c mostly. I think about the hardware that runs my code more than the average programmer. Yet if it was the 1980&#x27;s I would be a very high-level programmer. The assembly lang bros will look at me with contempt the same way I look at the python bros. The thought alone makes me shiver.
How we talk to computers has evolved. So many great engineers built the infrastructure that I use today to turn my c code into machine code. From the libraries, the operating system, and the compiler. There is a sort of deterministic heuristic-based intelligence b…</span>

                              <span>i know, kind of random. 

these days, kids in the region where i live get chromebooks at school. 

many of my students, including the ones who are now in middle school, are not efficient typers, and in fact many of them are slamming their pointer fingers down on keys one by one, the younger ones not even remembering where any of the letters are even after countless repetitions of the same words. 

and don&#x27;t even get me started on their spelling skills. 
choice, import, and scissors, although i&#x27;ll cut some of the younger ones slack on scissors. 

something else i find pretty funny is that occasionally they&#x27;ll try to touch the screen on the desktop to navigate. 

and this is all coming from an area where many of the school districts are top in the nation. 

did you also know that kids nowadays are more susceptible to online scams and malware? 

and overall, kids throughout the nation are reading at a significantly lower level than they should be, even with schooling. 

that&#x27;s it from me, thanks for reading my rant:)</span>

My late uncle’s wife and daughter (my cousin) kindly joined us too. I mentioned how much I wanted to see my cousin in an earlier post. When we went to my uncle’s apartment with strawberries in hand to visit her I felt bad seeing the eye bags and stress lines written all over their face. In spite of all that, they invited us in and told us their side of the story while shedding tears. The details of his precipitously declining health and death were gruesome; I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying. I can’t imagine the whirlwind of emotions the last month has been for them.
That said, I was still really glad to see my…</span>

Almost two weeks ago, I wrote about catching a crawfish in the pond near Jiaozi Park, not far from where I live. My wife and I weren&#x27;t sure what to do - whether we should put it back or keep it. Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.
I&#x27;m happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We&#x27;ve noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It&#x27;s no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we&#x27;re nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.
We&#x27;re trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well. I&#x27;ll provide more updates as things progress.</span>

                              <span>In the morning vendors sell wares out of cargo bicycles and vans along the main road. There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.
If I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides. Mom says my uncle was hit by a car in similar circumstances, which makes me jumpy. I try to give the vehicles weaving around us a wide berth, bu…</span>

                              <span>A gold Volkswagen Jetta with no seatbelts picks us up from the airport. Our driver talks to Mom in thick accent, slurring syllables together in bunches. There are many words I can’t catch, but the lilting rhythm falls comfortably on my ears.
I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

                              <span>A running list of things that have had a big impact on me :
Hank and John Green: Nerdfighteria is my internet home.
WaitButWhy: Deep dives into topics from first principles and cool sticky figures. Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.
Brandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.
Staring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.
LessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.
Richard Feynman&#x27;s Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…</span>
