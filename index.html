                              <span>Extremely sad. There basically is nothing like Anandtech; the depth, the ability to explain, the lack of sensationalism, and the integrity in benchmarking (I still vividly remember when they noticed an issue with HPET in Windows affecting their benchmarks, and promptly pulled all of them offline until they could reassess). Chips and Cheese is great but only covers a certain segment of it.
In the end, I would assume it just boiled down to lack of money. There were people among us who would gladly pay for this kind of coverage, but Anandtech said at some point they had considered it and couldn&#x27;t find a good model. (As an aside, I pay for LWN, and I would pay for something that covered similar areas to Phoronix but actually was good.)</span>

                              <span>There is no greater strategic madness than the belief that nuclear superiority must be maintained at each rung of the nuclear ladder in order to maintain deterrence.  U.S. weapons technology was a major driver of escalation dominance throughout the 1950s and 1960s along with the belief that the Soviet Union would move to a level of nuclear conflict that the United States could not counter.  “Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb” parodied these fears, and the arms control and disarmament developments of the 1970s and 1980s helped to defuse them.  Sadly, the Biden administration has taken a step that suggests a return to escalation dominance, which will spiral a Pentagon budget that will soon reach $1 trillion per year.

                              <span>True to form, Trump has now taken to calling Kamala Harris “low IQ” and “stupid,” racist tropes he draws on whenever he’s confronted by minorities, women or both. But for all her faults, Harris isn’t stupid. In fact, she’s demonstrated her ability to swiftly master and deftly deploy the finer points of Clintonian triangulation, the strategy of political bait-and-switch that prioritizes running against the core issues held by her own party, even policies she once enthusiastically promoted as signature features of her own previous campaigns. Pulling this off required some pretty adroit political gymnastics, where Harris had to completely reverse herself without showing the strain over long-held positions on fracking, immigration, asylum, a human rights-based foreign policy, student loan forgiveness, torture, the death penalty, and a single-payer health care system. But she sold these policy retreats so smoothly that the Democratic base eagerly embraced her joyful politics of austerity, aggressive policing and genocide with a smile. More

                              <span>There has been much attention online to a piece by Joseph Heath arguing that analytical Marxism disappeared because the analytical Marxists all turned into Rawlsian liberals. At a certain level of resolution (blurred, zoomed out) the argument has something going for it. But at that level, all it amounts to is the claim that this […]</span>

                              <span>I don’t know. Reading this made me tear up a bit. I learned software engineering when I was in junior high school. I learned it because I sucked at math, and I want to write  programs that solve my homework. Then I continue writing LAN chat, HTTP server, Anti Virus, and a lot more things just because it was fun to do.
It was fun, it was challenging, it was rewarding, it was amazing.
Now that I’m working, with the endless stream of new technologies, the debates of X considered harmful, J is better than K, and a barrage of never ending new things. It started to numb my mind.
Somehow, those joyful feeling of engineering no longer feels like the blue sky. I think its still blue, but for an eye washed in silvers, everything looks gray.
Reading this story somehow light up that childhood feeling of me learning software engineering. It can still be fun. I can still write things for the sake of me and not for the sake of exit nor a new shiny SaaS.
Thank your for writing this. It gave me a ray of hope that it can still be fun.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re interested in historical buildings, go ahead, visit Bletchley Park. But expect most of the exhibits to be buildings, living quarters, offices etc. and mundane descriptions of day-to-day life there, not exhibits about the technical/cryptological aspects (although they do have some of those too).
If you&#x27;re interested in computer history and Bombe/Colossus, visit the much lesser known National Museum of Computing at the same site. https://www.tnmoc.org/
I spent way too much time at the the boring parts of Bletchley Park and as a result didn&#x27;t have enough time for the Museum of Computing.
I&#x27;d recommend starting at the Museum of Computing, then if you have time left, the 1-2 buildings inside the official Bletchley Park museum that have the crypto exhibits.</span>

this is my favorite story from running the site, and possibly the best story I&#x27;ve ever been a part of. I&#x27;m not a big crier but I have cried so many times thinking and trying to write about it over the past 2 months. And of course, the process of discovery (and going from panic to excitement) was pretty crazy too.
One of my favorite things about this is that it validated one of the core beliefs I have when making these things - that you need constraints for the small group of people that are jerks, but that for the most part those constraints are fodder for the largely-good and very creative folks that play around on the internet.
Happy to answer any questions folks have!</span>

                              <span>I spend four months of the year traveling in an RV. Two years ago, I budgeted over $6000 for my desired solar setup (at least 1200Ah of battery, at least 2400W of solar, plus various controllers and other components). It was expensive enough for me to hold off, and more importantly, I didn&#x27;t have the space on my current RV for the solar panels.
In just the two years since then, prices on batteries and panels have dropped 25% or more, and solar power per square foot at a good price point has gone up significantly (400W monocrystalline panels can be gotten for $200, in the same form factor as the 200W panels I had been budgeting for). I&#x27;ve now lowered my budget to $4000 for the same setup I was planning to spend $6000 on two years ago, and with 400W panels, I no longer need to upgrade to a l…</span>

The article mentions that FlyCASS seems to be run by one person. This isn&#x27;t a matter of technical chops, this is a matter of someone who is good at navigating bureaucracy convincing the powers that be that they should have a special hook into the system.
What should really be investigated is who on the government side approved and vetted the initial FlyCASS proposal and subsequent development? And why, as something with a special hook into airline security infrastructure, was it never security audited?</span>

It is really telling that they try to cover up and deny instead of fix it, but not surprising. That is a natural consequence of authoritarian thinking, which is the entire premise and culture of the TSA. Any institution that covers up and ignores existential risks instead of confronting them head on will eventually implode by consequences of its own negligence- which hopefully will happen to the TSA.</span>

                              <span>The TSA&#x27;s response here is childish and embarrassing, although perhaps unsurprising given the TSA&#x27;s institutional disinterest in actual security. It&#x27;s interesting to see that DHS seemingly (initially) handled the report promptly and professionally, but then failed to maintain top-level authority over the fix and disclosure process.</span>

                              <span>The current comments seem to say this is rings the death knell of social media and that this just leads to government censorship. I&#x27;m not so sure.
I think the ultimate problem is that social media is not unbiased — it curates what people are shown. In that role they are no longer an impartial party merely hosting content. It seems this ruling is saying that the curation being algorithmic does not absolve the companies from liability.
In a very general sense, this ruling could be seen as a form of net neutrality. Currently social media platforms favor certain content, while down weighting others. Sure, it might be at a different level than peer agreements between ISPs and websites, but it amounts to a similar phenomenon when most people interact on social media through the feed.
Honestly, I think I&#x27;d love to see what changes this ruling brings about. HN is quite literally the only social media site (loosely interpreted) I even have an account on anymore, mainly because of how truly awful all the sites have become. Maybe this will make social media more palatable again? Maybe not, but I&#x27;m inclined to see what shakes out.</span>

As you can probably guess from the title, I quit my job to focus on my studies. I started a master’s degree in computational linguistics this year, and I&#x27;ve been juggling both work and university.
Working and studying simultaneously has its advantages—the first one is obvious: money. While academic life has its perks, financial gain isn’t usually one of them. Working while studying allowed me to make a living, plain and simple.
But there are other benefits, too—like advancing my career as a software engineer, working on interesting problems, interacting with customers, and having the routine of going to the office and spe…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been considering starting a supporters page for a while, but I&#x27;ve been feeling conflicted...
I don&#x27;t want to launch it just for the sake of it. While I want it to add some value, I don&#x27;t want it to feel like a cheaper experience for those who don&#x27;t want to or can contribute financially.
The solution became Birming Buddies.
This gives you early access to new add-ons and palettes for the Bearming theme. You&#x27;ll also be mentioned on the Birming Buddies page, and your name will be highlighted in blog challenges that you participate in.
Additionally, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to comment and make suggestions for theme features when new posts are made on the Ko-fi supporters page.
I hope this adds value for those who wish to contribute, while still allowing everyone else to continue using this blog and the theme without restrictions.
Thank you so much for your support!
PS. Despite the Birming Buddies name, I consider anyone who visits my blog a true buddy. You&#x27;re awesome!</span>

                              <span>I have a PhD in Physics from Berkeley. Still, in the strictest real estate sense, my best and highest use is as a dishwasher.
I was managing a small optics factory in Livermore. We made laser mirrors to order there — any wavelength, any reflectivity, any angle, any polarization, you name it. I was working my ass off and was unmarried at the time. Thanksgiving came around and I had nowhere to go. But I hooked up with a church in San Jose that had a dinner for poor people and went as a volunteer. After serving the dinner, I wandered back into the dish room. I immediately went over to the sink and kicked out the lady who was pretending to work. I then washed all the dishes and left.
Comes one year later.  I’m in the exact same situation.  I call up that church.  The lady says, “Oh, that’s very nice of you.  But we don’t need any more volunteers, we have enough.”  Oh shit.  What to do.  I found my old replica army parka I had bought in a Cambridge surplus store 20 years earlier. I went as a poor person. I didn’t want to be alone.
The first thing I found out is that poor people are herded, controlled, treated like children. We had to wait outside the church in the mild cold until permitted to enter, in a kind of line. So I sit down.  I will never forget the beatific smiles of the volunteers that served us.  This was performance art, and they were the stars.  Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this, I’m sure. So the meal ends. I walk back into the dish room, survey the situation, once again kick out whoever was pretending to do the dishes, do the dishes, and leave.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Apparently there’s more cause, effect, and sequencing in diffusion models than what I expected
To temper this a bit, you may want to pay close attention to the demo videos. The player rarely backtracks, and for good reason - the few times the character does turn around and look back at something a second time, it has changed significantly (the most noticeable I think is the room with the grey wall and triangle sign).
This falls in line with how we&#x27;d expect a diffusion model to behave - it&#x27;s trained on many billions of frames of gameplay, so it&#x27;s very good at generating a plausible -next- frame of gameplay based on some previous frames. But it doesn&#x27;t deeply understand logical gameplay constraints, like remembering level geometry.</span>

                              <span>This analysis leaves out the fact that Pavel Durov is, with Telegram, in approximately the same position Ladar Levison was with Lavabit. Unlike Meredith Whitaker, Durov actually is in a position to furnish documents to the French government, where he has citizenship. He&#x27;s in that position because he has repeatedly made deliberate product decisions, to the bafflement of cryptographers around the world, to keep himself in that position.
If you literally have plaintext documents responsive to criminal inquiries in a jurisdiction you are subject to, we don&#x27;t reach the &quot;internet censorship wars&quot;. You&#x27;re in a place not dissimilar to a 1970s telephone company; the &quot;random people can&#x27;t simply declare themselves above the law wars&quot;. Don&#x27;t be in that place.

Title: Builders in Solidarity
Subtitle: A rambunctious Russian-speaking union shakes up Sweden’s labor movement
Date: August 16, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 28th August 2024 from meduza.io

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …</span>

 For most contemporaries, Michail Bakunin is unknown. If a certain number of people only know him by name, that is enough to hate and slander him. But there are some who love him with fervour. 
 Once Bakunin was truly a great name. While one would search in vain in the edition of the great encyclopedic dictionary published in 1866 for the name of Karl Marx, tha…</span>

Before I start, I must say, I am a user of $HIMS when it comes to their preventative &quot;hair-loss&quot; lineup. I wish I had an affiliate link to plug to help hedge this trade, but I&#x27;m shit out of luck.
Okay, so what&#x27;s the trade? Why do I think it&#x27;s a pretty damn good opp, and what is going on?
Well, $HIMS is down 32.54% in the past month and has a current enterprise value of just over 3 billion with a market cap of 3.2 billion. Staircase up and elevator down type of action... somewhat.

Back on June 18th of this year, we had an enterprise value of 5.13B before quickly drifting on off after allegations that the company&#x27;s GLP-1 weight-loss drugs were sourced from a &quot;shady supplier.&quot; This has raised concerns about the quality and safety of their products.

                              <span>Dear Dad,
Today marks the first anniversary of your passing. Not a day goes... eeh, what’s that you said?
&quot;I know, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in.&quot;
Haha! Your sense of humor is intact. That&#x27;s still one of the first things people mention when your name comes up: your wonderful sense of humor, and how incredibly kind you were.
You truly treated everyone with the same care and respect.
I still remember the incident in the garden from when I was little. A drug addict had wandered in and fallen asleep there. Mom and all of us kids stood at a safe distance, nervously watching as you helped him. Before staggering off, he turned around with tears of gratitude and asked:
&quot;Are you a priest?&quot;
That’s the kind of person you were. A helping hand and a life saver. A true hero.
As you know, your other son turns 50 today. But this day is not about birth or death. It’s a day of celebration and love. A day of unity, no matter the realm of residence.
Thank you for the long and wonderful time you gave us. Thank you for all the lovely memories that keep your spirit alive. Thank you for all the beautiful things you passed on to us.
I&#x27;ll end with your last words:
I love you!</span>

                              <span>We’re finally back home.
I’ve had a really good few days (since Friday) break. We did a lot in a relatively short amount of time.
So many indicators of a memorable time.
Tan lines in random places to indicate getting that much needed Vitamin D.
Photographs that froze time to be remembered and printed.
(Enamel) Pins added to my collection of places visited.
Stickers. All of the stickers, even though pins have replaced that obsession.
A couple of library cards to show that even during vacation, I still think about all of the books to be read in the future.
Memories of full bellies because we ate a lot of really yummy food.
I’m still processing everything. I’ll be posting all of the photos in the future, whether it be on here, or on the photoblog.
Last day of my very short “vacation” today.
I woke up this morning after having dreamt of work, with tears in my eyes. Is it respectable for me to throw a tantrum to show that I really don’t want to go back to work tomorrow?
Probably not. For today, I’m going to try really hard to just not think about it.
Vacation is not over until it’s over.

                              <span>I worked on Mono a lot back in the early 2000s (back in the SVN days before it moved to Git, even). This move makes a lot of sense. Things evolved a lot over the years. Mono&#x27;s legacy goals, which are to be a portable CLR (.NET) runtime for platforms that Microsoft didn&#x27;t care about, don&#x27;t make much sense today.
Mono made a lot of sense for running places where full .NET didn&#x27;t, like in full AOT environments like on the iPhone where you can&#x27;t JIT, or for random architectures that don&#x27;t matter anymore but once did for Linux (Alpha, Itanium, PPC, MIPs, etc.). When Microsoft bought Xamarin (which itself was born out of the ashes of the Novell shutdown of the Mono effort) and started the DotNET Core efforts to make .NET more portable itself and less a system-provided framework and merge in a lot of the stuff Mono did a single more focused project made more sense.
Mono was still left out there to support the edge cases where DotNET Core didn&#x27;t make sense, which was mostly things like being a backend for Wine stuff in some cases, some GNOME Desktop stuff (via GTK#, which is pretty dead now), and older niche use cases (second life and Unity still embed mono as a runtime for their systems). The project was limping, though, and sharing a standard library but different runtimes after much merging. Mono&#x27;s runtime was always a little more portable (C instead of C++) and more accessible to experiment with, but we need that less and less, but it&#x27;s still perfect for Wine. So, having it live on in Wine makes sense. It&#x27;s a natural fit.</span>

                              <span>I read a lot. Probably more than a lot of people, but still not as much as some.
When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it&#x27;s just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less growing up. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn&#x27;t unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library&#x27;s entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with a local library card to start with. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I&#x27;m a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards &#x3D; even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.

People in the first world take having fun very seriously. We sure spend enough money on it. Some kinds of fun are pricing themselves out of the middle-class range. Tickets and all that goes with them (parking, food, souvenirs) to major league sports and top-tier concerts can easily take a family outing into four figures. A day at a Disney theme park for a family of four is well over $1000.
I&#x27;ve never been to a Disney Park, and my last concert was 15 years ago. I guess I&#x27;ll die without seeing Bruce Springsteen. I heard the other day that he&#x27;s reached billionaire status, and I&#x27;m not giving a billionaire any of my dough to be entertained for three hours, no matter how good a showman he is. I enjoy amateur and minor league sports. Hell, I like watching my grandson&#x27;s socce…</span>

                              <span>Great quote at 45:26 regarding vertical vs. horizontal scaling: https://youtu.be/si9iqF5uTFk?t&#x3D;2726
&gt; &quot;Now back in the early days of this country, when they moved heavy objects around, they didn&#x27;t have any Caterpillar tractors, they didn&#x27;t have any big cranes. They used oxen. And when they got a great big log on the ground, and one ox couldn&#x27;t budge the darn thing, they did not try to grow a bigger ox. They used two oxen! And I think they&#x27;re trying to tell us something. When we need greater computer power, the answer is not &quot;get a bigger computer&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;get another computer&quot;. Which of course, is what common sense would have told us to begin with.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I like the Swiss implementation of this. A manager _can_ contact an employee on a Sunday, but then the employee is immediately on weekend-rate overtime even if they just got an email with &quot;deal with this next week&quot;. So, many companies have systems that hold back e-mail sent outside of working hours until the next working day unless specially authorised and costed.
Never underestimate an economics-based solution to a legal problem, a.k.a. &quot;if you really want to ban it, tax it&quot;.</span>

                              <span>I know what you’re thinking:
“Not another blog challenge!”
But hear me out...
There’s been a debate lately about the existence or non-existence of blog challenges. The criticism has been that quantity takes precedence over quality. Even though there haven’t been any requirements for daily posts, it’s sort of become the norm to post every day.
With that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A &quot;challenge&quot; where quality comes first – and only.
The idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your &quot;best&quot; during the month.
The post that...
...you are most proud of.
...was the hardest to write.
...is the most personal.
...best represents you.
...made you think in new ways.
Or whatever you base &quot;best&quot; on. Your favorite, simply put.
Why this challenge?
As a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.
If you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.
Please note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.

That&#x27;s it.
That&#x27;s the post.
A reflection post upcoming at some point, but not today.
Today, the plan is to bask in the sun, spend the day in one of the cutest towns, and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

...and of course, snapping photos of all of the things

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this calculator was good or bad, but the rationale sounds superficially ridiculous.
&gt; Visitors who didn&#x27;t see the calculator were 16% more likely to sign up and 90% more likely to contact us than those who saw it. There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.
Of course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That&#x27;s not something you will figure out from a short-term A/B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.
I see this dynamic frequently with A/B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A/B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through. The question of which is actually better seemed to have been totally forgotten.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dabbled in management a few times in my career. This meant attending manager-only meetings and trainings. I&#x27;ll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, &quot;The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they&#x27;ll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else.&quot; This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.
After I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I&#x27;d need to be &quot;one of them.&quot; I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.
I know not every manager is like that. I&#x27;d like to think I wasn&#x27;t. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.</span>

                              <span>In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.
The Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.
The report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.
Indeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he&#x27;d done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.</span>

Buying this house was not the easiest. During the entire nightmare of a process, I remember thinking that I wanted to blog about it (I wasn’t writing yet then) in detail, so that all first time homebuyers could avoid the stress we endured. Also, no one ever teaches you any of this in school, so I’m not exactly sure how anyone could know the process until they’re knees deep in it already.
Yes, there are plenty of articles out there about the house buying process, but it still doesn’t truly prepare you for the real thing. At least it didn’t for us.
I want to caveat that this house was not my first house. In 2012, I bought my first hou…</span>

The app solves many problems I have, but it solves each one poorly.
The app solves some problems I have and some that I don’t, making parts of it useless to me.
I don’t want what they call a Super-app. I want an app designed to solve something specific, one that has been thoughtfully crafted to address a particular need.

Every once in a while I discover a real gem where someone&#x27;s efforts are all at once entertaining, thought provoking, inspiring and original. I&#x27;ll often be stricken with a pang of jealousy. &quot;I want to write like that&quot;, I&#x27;ll tell myself, knowing that I won&#x27;t. Alas, I write like me.

 Everything fits together, from the bird whose brood is crushed to the humans whose nest is destroyed by war. 
 —Louise Michel 
 In this essay I explore the relations between contemporary anarchism and animal rights/liberation through the lens of Deleuze/Guattari-inflected complex systems theory. Specifically, I look at the liberalism and normative practices endemic to the mainstream animal rights movement, engaging with some of the more salient critiques that have emerged from Leftist an…</span>

Subtitle: CNT-E’s XI Congress agreements on internationalism
Date: 5 April 2016
Source: Retrieved on 25th August 2024 from www.cnt.es

 The CNT would like to announce and explain the agreements made during our December 2015 Congress with regards to the current International Workers’ Association (IWA). We believe that it is necessary to explain our position on the drift of our international, so that this internal situation can be made publically known in order to openly and quickly begin the process of its re-foundation.
