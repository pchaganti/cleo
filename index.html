                              <span>Kubernetes components use on-off switches called feature gates to manage the risk of adding a new feature.
The feature gate mechanism is what enables incremental graduation of a feature through the stages Alpha, Beta, and GA.
Kubernetes components, such as kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler, use the client-go library to interact with the API.
The same library is used across the Kubernetes ecosystem to build controllers, tools, webhooks, and more. client-go now includes
its own feature gating mechanism, giving developers and cluster administrators more control over how they adopt client features.

                              <span>The only reason this could be funny is because the software industry has found a way to excuse itself from any liability.
There is no other industry where someone could cause so much damage and laugh about it. Least of all because the liability itself would have led to its collapse.
Can you imagine a company hired to reinforce a bridge to protect it from damage from a ship instead causes its collapse.
How long is that company gonna last? Even if no one dies or is injured it will be run out of business.
Only in Tech can such a company not only survive but laugh about it.
And that’s even before we get to how amateurish the mistake these guys made was.</span>

                              <span>The CADTM welcomes the departure of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as a victory for the courageous student movement, which has been in July-August 2024 the victim of a terrible repression that left over 400 people dead. Nevertheless, given the social and economic orientation of the new Prime Minister, Muhammad Yunus, we can only fear that the neo-liberal capitalist extractivist export model will continue and that the debt system will also continue.

                              <span>One of the things I&#x27;ve seen around Mastodon is the concept of Silent Sundays on... Sundays. I&#x27;ve never participated in it and don&#x27;t really know the history behind it. I have noticed that most people post a simple photo that projects a peaceful vibe, and for the most part... silent.
The past couple of days was a lot of socializing due to a friend staying with us. My social battery is a bit depleted, so for today, I will also practice some sort of Silent Sunday.
Anyways, here you go. A photo from yesterday for #SilentSunday. Context later.

Taken with the CampSnap Camera.
Not my usual type of post, but I kind of like it. Until tomorrow.

                              <span>During the weekend, I sat and fiddled with a new theme for Bear blog.
I&#x27;m not a professional designer and have no ambition to become one. I just think it&#x27;s very fun and interesting to tinker with. Time slips away in an almost meditative state as small snippets of text magically transform the canvas.
Regardless of what we like or do for work, I think it&#x27;s extremely important to have personal interests. Unfortunately, these are often the first things to go when we&#x27;re struggling.
I&#x27;ve been in the darkest of places myself. One by one, I abandoned my interests. Not because I&#x27;d lost interest, but because I thought it would fix what was broken.
A fruitless attempt, of course, to try to fix the inside by messing with the outside. A downward spiral that accelerated into the bottomless depths with each interest I let go. In the end, they were all gone – and I felt worse than ever.
Fortunately, I got the help I needed. Slowly but surely, I began to climb out of the grave I&#x27;d dug for myself. As time passed, I started to reintroduce my interests, slowly and cautiously: designing, photography, movies…
It wasn’t a quick fix, that’s for sure, and not the only change I had to make. But things were heading in the right direction.
Now I feel better than in a long, long time –although it’s still like being on a crab fishing boat on the Bering Sea, not knowing when the next storm will hit.
If it weren&#x27;t for rediscovering my love of my interests and letting them illuminate my life, I&#x27;d still be lost in the dark. My interests are lighthouses on the rough sea of life.</span>

 No contradiction can exist between the economic and the political aspects of a revolutionary conception, even supposing the clearest organic and functional demarcation between them. The same is true for any reactionary conception. Hence the present interpenetration, the agreement and collaboration between unions—economic organs —and political parties—ideological organs—gives us the key to understanding both, from whichever side o…</span>

                              <span>Last week I was passing the ball around with my new friend M when someone approached us and asked us to join his team. On Thursday he texted to confirm if I could play Saturday and so today I duly trotted onto the turf under the suffocating mid morning sun. I felt sluggish almost from the get go. Most days I know as soon as I start playing whether it’s going to be a good or bad game.
Our team is a ragtag bunch. Everyone is small or out of shape (or, in my case, both). They played me out of position, in defense, and I didn’t have a choice because we started the game with no substitutes on the bench.
The players across the field in orange dwarfed me. I always try to tell myself that I play one of the sports where David can triumph against Goliath — just look how short Messi is — but sadly I’…</span>

                              <span>🗓️ // August 3 - August 9, 2024
I have switched to posting my Week Notes to Saturdays, although it will encompass Saturday-Friday of my week (this sounds somewhat awkward but I have yet to find a flow that makes sense).
This week has been hard, as is the trend for the past few months. Learning to wrap my head (and heart) around some of the things happening within my ecosystem.
The new coffee table we bought came in early. It was much easier to put together than the TV stand that took us hours. The coffee table is 100lbs+ since it’s made with marble, and by far the heaviest coffee table I’ve ever owned.
I randomly entered Porkbun’s 2 million Domains Giveaway earlier last week, and got notified that I was one of the winners. I love free shirts! (And just free things in general).

                              <span>&quot;We are all different&quot; – a phrase thrown around quite often. And thankfully, it&#x27;s true. Some adore winter, others summer; some thrive in nature, while others prefer the city.
But there&#x27;s one area where this diversity seems absent: socializing.
The first to leave a party is branded a bore. Anyone declining a gathering is deemed a weirdo. Going to the movies alone marks you as strange.
Why is this? Why does socializing always trump solitude? It&#x27;s as if loneliness is automatically equated with something being wrong.
There&#x27;s a lot of talk about the importance of online privacy, but when it comes to wanting some privacy in the physical world, it&#x27;s a different story. We&#x27;re expected to be &quot;online&quot; by default, 24/7. If we go &quot;offline,&quot; it&#x27;s treated as a malfunction — a 404 page.
People often tell me I&#x27;m a social person. Sure, I enjoy listening to others, asking questions, and reflecting on their experiences in light of my own. But it comes with a price...
After two or three hours, I&#x27;m exhausted. I experience a &quot;social hangover.&quot; Everyone seems to be talking endlessly about nothing, as if there&#x27;s a collective fear of silence and stillness.
Why is solitude taboo?
I don&#x27;t have the answers, but I&#x27;ve gotten better at announcing my early departure. It still feels odd to do so, and occasionally, I&#x27;m met with confusion. But honestly, I don&#x27;t care — I&#x27;m too old for that, and it feels incredibly liberating.

Title: Can Stoicism Be Reconciled With Anarchy?
Subtitle: A comparative examination of Anarcho-Stoicism
Date: 10th August 2024
Source: Retrieved on August 10, 2024 from https://morewretchthansage.substack.com/p/how-can-stoicism-be-reconciled-with

How can Stoicism, a philosophy that has largely come down to us from the hierarchical, centralised, statist, Roman Empire and whose most famous adherent was an absolute Monarch, be reconciled with Anarchy?
 At first consideration Anarchy and Stoicism seem unlikely bedfellows. Much of Stoicism has come down to us through the Roman&#x27; Late Stoa&#x27; of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Seneca was a Billionaire slave-owner politician, and Marcus Aurelius was an absolute monarch… but Epictetus was a disabled enslaved person,…</span>

Declaration at the trial (October 30 2013) for the wounding of Ansaldo Nucleare managing director Roberto Adinolfi
 ‘Nobody can judge me 
 Not even you 
 The truth hurts you, I know.’ 
 C. Caselli 
 A few words to make a few simple points before the ‘truth’ is pronounced by the court; just in case it’s not clear, I am using the word ‘truth’ ironically as I don’t recognize any tribunal other than my own conscience. The only ones responsible for what happened in Genoa on May 7 2012 are Alfredo and myself. None of our friends or comrades knew what we were planning and then carried out.

 “The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.” 
 - The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin 
 We in the Libertarian Socialist Caucus (LSC) of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) recognize that our formation has dual obligations, both to the development of the socialist movement in the United States and to the broader libertarian socialist movement that exists outside of DSA. While much of our caucus’ focus thus far has been on DSA’s internal politics, we believe in cross-pollination with the broader libertarian left via an …</span>

                              <span>This is interesting, but I have to quibble with this:
&gt; If you express this value in any other units, the magic immediately disappears. So, this is no coincidence
Ordinarily, this would be extremely indicative of a coincidence. If you’re looking for a heuristic for non-coincidences, “sticks around when you change units” is the one you want. This is just an unusual case where that heuristic fails.</span>

                              <span>Was shocked to hear this news. I worked for Google years ago but I was in the NYC office, so we didn&#x27;t run into the YouTube folks much.
Opinions about YouTube may be mixed here on HN, but it is objectively one of the most successful businesses in tech or media to emerge in the past 15 years. If it weren&#x27;t buried inside Alphabet, Youtube would be worth on the order of $400 billion, more than Disney and Comcast combined. It&#x27;s a weird mix of a huge creator monetization network, a music channel, an education platform, a forever-store of niche content, and a utility.
It&#x27;s also not a business that rested on it&#x27;s laurels. It&#x27;s easy to forget how novel creator monetization was when YouTube adopted it. They do a lot of active work to manage their creators, and now have grown into a music and podcast platform that is challenging Apple. To top it off, YouTube TV, despite costing just as much as cable, is objectively a good product.
Few products have the brand, the reach, monetization, and the endurance that YouTube has had within Google. And I know for a fact that this is in no small part due to the way it was managed.
I&#x27;ve probably watched tens of thousands of hours of YouTube at this point. Some of it sublime, some of it absurd, some of it critical for my work or my degree. I couldn&#x27;t imagine a world without it.
RIP.</span>

Edit: some people misinterpreted my comment. I&#x27;m just one anonymous  voice on the Internet, but am deeply saddened by the passing of Susan Wojcicki, who meant a lot to me as one of the many people who crossed paths with her professionally. I wish her family strength in a very trying moment. She did not deserve this. I&#x27;ve not met another business leader demonstrate everyday kindness to the degree that she did.
Her untimely passing is also a reminder to those of us who sometimes look up to such successful businesspeople that we should all appreciate our luck to be alive and enjoy it to the fullest, as I hope that she did as well, and as I&#x27;m sure that she&#x27;d prefer we did. RIP</span>

                              <span>The before/after ECU layout diagram is very instructional.
I like to imagine some kind of engineering “meet cute” whereby, one random day, the headlights engineer and the parking radar engineer happen to be working on the front of the car together.  Their eyes meet:
“hey, I’m John — I didn’t know you had an ECU here!”,
“hi, I’m Claire — wow, you have an ECU right up front too?  It’s, like, right next to mine and we never knew!”
“I know, crazy right?!  Hey this is going to sound really forward and I don’t normally do this but I’m only running at 70% compute capacity.  I don’t suppose you need any real-time budget this evening?”
“So funny you should ask, I was just about to run a whole bunch of heavy new wiring to…”
And in a story as old as time they get ECU married and raise their control loops in the same front-of-vehicle ECU together instead of living their separate, lonely, ECU-right-next-to-each-other-and-they-didn’t-know-it lives.</span>

If your load fits entirely on one server, then just run the database on that damn server and forget about “special architectures to reduce round-trips to your database”. If your data fits entirely in RAM, then use a ramdisk for the database if you want, and replicate it to permanent storage with standard tools. Now that’s actually simple.</span>

Edit just to clarify: I&#x27;m generally in favor of legalization and I don&#x27;t believe in restricting responsible use by adults. I&#x27;ve just noticed really strong reactions to this kind of discussion.</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
This is Bess, Jake&#x27;s wife. I just want to say how deeply touched I am to see how much Jake and his writing are appreciated here on HN. The intellectual online community which made up a big piece of his life for so long was important to him, as was having a positive influence on others, and it would have meant so much to him- as it does to me- to see the impact he made. Thank you for the people who reached out while he was still alive to make sure he knew just how large that impact was.
I&#x27;ve lost the love of my life, as well as my thinking and writing partner, and everything is strange and disorienting right now. It&#x27;s a comfort when nothing feels comfortable to know how appreciated he was and still is. As soon as I&#x27;m able, and for anyone who is interested in joining the efforts, I promised him I&#x27;d continue the push for FDA reform, and to try to find ways to improve agency for cancer patients so that other people in his position might suffer less than he did. I&#x27;ve never known a braver person. I&#x27;ll miss him forever, but won&#x27;t stop trying to keep his legacy alive.
Please feel free to reach out anytime (I&#x27;m at drbstillman@gmail.com). Thank you also for all the well wishes for myself and Athena, who I hope will be just like her Dad.</span>

                              <span>My biggest frustration with .internal is that it requires a private certificate authority. Lots of organizations struggle to fully set up trust for the private CA on all internal systems. When you add BYOD or contractor systems, it&#x27;s a mess.
Using a publicly valid domain offers a number of benefits, like being able to use a free public CA like Lets Encrypt. Every machine will trust your internal certificates out of the box, so there is minimal toil.
Last year I built getlocalcert [1] as a free way to automate this approach. It allows you to register a subdomain, publish TXT records for ACME DNS certificate validation, and use your own internal DNS server for all private use.

That includes numerous topics, over the past year or so his experience with cancer, often concerning frustrations with the process and mechanism.
His essay on agenticness especially strikes me as hugely insightful and underappreciated.  It was submitted several times to HN but saw little discussion:

You know what? I do. We all should. These scammers are awful people and deserve to be attacked. I am tired of toothless authorities like CISA and the alphabet agencies in the US doing next to nothing about it unless some YouTube scam baiter does the work for them. Scammers destroy people, not just financially, but emotionally as well, even driving some victims to suicide. As far as I am concerned,  any wannabe hacker out there should be using these scammers for target practice.</span>

                              <span>In this episode of CounterPunch Radio, Rebecca Maria Goldschmidt talks with fellow members of California Jewish Artists for Palestine Sophia Sobko and Steph Kudisch, about their collective decision to submit and withdraw explicitly anti-Zionist artworks to an open call for Jewish artists at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. They discuss the process of pulling their works out of the exhibition; the importance of the academic and cultural boycott of Israel (PACBI); and what it means to be Jewish artists publicly confronting Jewish arts institutions that receive Zionist funding and are struggling to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.
Steph Kudisch is a trans genderfluid artist whose work uses mutated intertidal aesthetics and personal storytelling to dwell in in-betweens. They work as a teaching artist on Lisjan Ohlone land, also known as the San Francisco Bay Area. Kudisch and their collaborator Kate Laster form Clear as Schmutz Press as well as the collective Hevra Kadisha in which they create site-specific works across the mediums of printmaking, sculpture, performance, and sound.
Sophia Sobko (she/they) is an artist, educator &amp; researcher born in Moscow, USSR &amp; based on Lisjan Ohlone Land in Oakland, CA. They are excited about collaborative learning, participatory art, and co-creating a more liberatory world. Sophia is founder/co-steward of two queer post-Soviet Jewish collectives: Kolektiv Goluboy Vagon and Krivoy Kolektiv.

The lack of democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth. More

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant referred to Israel’s assault on Gaza as a fight against “human animals.” Other Israeli officials called for erasing Gaza from the face of the earth, claiming that no Palestinian civilians are innocent.

                              <span>I’ve been seeing a lot of Reply posts, or just posts in general with bloggers playing off of each other’s blog posts and think it’s absolutely fantastic.
During my Wordpress days, I took for granted the automatic pingbacks (is that still a thing?) when my post gets mentioned somewhere, and I know that Webmentions exist, but now I’m doing things a little bit more manual.
Earlier last month, around the time I posted To Blogroll, or to not?, I added a section at the bottom of my posts (when it applies) titled 💬 COMMUNITY ECHOES. In this section, I add posts I run across that is either a response to that post, or references the post in some way.
Some examples from my recent posts where you can see this section:
Video Games I&#x27;ve Owned and Played
The Plan to Not Have a Plan
When Every Day Feels the Same
Adding references to other posts that have been written on similar subjects allows readers to click through to see other people’s takes on that specific subject. I know that I personally enjoy reading other people’s blogs, and then finding a link to another blog that talks about the same thing, especially if it’s the same subject with a different (or same) perspective. It’s also (selfishly) nice for me to keep track of posts that mention mine for my own personal documentation.
I welcome you all to go down the rabbit hole of posts with me.
Also, if there is a blog post of yours where mine is referenced that I missed, feel free to let me know, so that I can add it.
Happy reading!

                              <span>The Indie Web is a great place. Ever since I started writing on this website, I&#x27;ve received the most heartwarming reactions—from plain old emails to guestbook comments, and in some cases, even reply posts that can spark discussions in what might otherwise feel like posting into the void.
A reply post like this was RE: Why Are Shoes Treated Differently Than Shirts by Marisabel, which really made me think about stuff I wrote in my original post. I loved that! She mentioned me on Mastodon, and I thanked her for the reply, it really made my day back then.
Last week, I discovered another reply through the analytics page of my bear blog, which had a referrer I wasn’t familiar with—mgx. I visited the website and found a reply post to my bat incident! It had a short poem about it, which made me laugh and brightened my day, especially since I was feeling quite sick after the vaccine.
I wanted to thank mgx for the reply, but I couldn’t find a way to contact on the website. Obviously, not everyone wants to be approachable, and I understand that, but I still wanted to acknowledge the reply—so here we are!</span>

                              <span>I believe consistent Bearblogging has made me a better writer, but not in the way you might think. I don&#x27;t mean it has drastically perked my English grammar or refined my sentence structure (though these have definitely been a bonus). Instead, it makes me write more, and, subjectively, that is my definition of a good writer: someone who writes.
Before Bearblog, I had a penchant for perfectionism with writing, which made me avoid it for years. For my first blogpost, I was rusty from the lack of practice, and I faced difficulty expressing my internal chaos of thoughts &amp; ideas into coherent phrasing. I was practically forcing out words. That paid off, though, because regular Bearblogging has made my words come more naturally now. I easily phrase whatever crosses my mind, writing as I go along…</span>

                              <span>This is very exciting! For the last several years I have been developing a brushless motor driver based on the RP2040 [1]. The driver module can handle up to 53 volts at 30A continuous, 50A peak. I broke the driver out to a separate module recently which is helpful for our farm robot and is also important for driver testing as we improve the design. However this rev seems pretty solid, so I might build a single board low cost integrated single motor driver with the RP2350 soon! With the RP2040 the loop rate was 8khz which is totally fine for big farm robot drive motors, but some high performance drivers with floating point do 50khz loop rate.
My board runs SimpleFOC, and people on the forum have been talking about building a flagship design, but they need support for sensorless control as well as floating point, so if I use the new larger pinout variant of the RP2350 with 8 ADC pins, we can measure three current signals and three bridge voltages to make a nice sensorless driver! It will be a few months before I can have a design ready, but follow the git repo or my twitter profile [2] if you would like to stay up to date!

                              <span>IME what works best getting new projects kick started is hiring a very small team of senior freelancers, making one of them lead, and letting them loose. I worked on such a team once and it was really excellent. The advantage of this strategy is if the experiment doesn&#x27;t work out, terminating freelancers is much easier than permanent (I noted you&#x27;re based in Europe).
Contrary to what other people said, I wouldn&#x27;t try find a CTO straightaway. It&#x27;s a hard role to hire for, especially at the start. I think you&#x27;re better off unleashing a small, excellent team of builders then hire management later to help build out the team if the initial effort succeeds.
Happy to chat more about my experiences with this strategy, davedx@gmail.com (I&#x27;m in Europe too)</span>

                              <span>I used to be a tree-style-tabs power user but at some point I went back to regular tabs. I find that the amount of horizontal tab space is pretty close to the actual number of things I can usefully have open at once. Seeing the tabs get &quot;squished&quot; is my reminder to close the ones I no longer need.
I was using the tab-state as a sort of short-term working memory and I don&#x27;t think it was doing me any favours, particularly in terms of focus.
Now when I&#x27;m working on a project, I keep a list of relevant URLs in a text file (i.e. bookmarks but checked into source control).
I also use two browser windows, a regular one for &quot;stateful&quot; browsing, and a private-mode one for &quot;stateless&quot; browsing. Quick queries and exploratory research happens in the &quot;stateless&quot; session, with the understanding that I can close any of these tabs (or nuke the whole session) at any time without losing anything important. If I do come across something important, it gets noted down elsewhere.</span>

                              <span>I would argue the opposite. They are not aiming to be a neutral arbiter but an active advocate for better repairability. For that they should have for-profit business relationships with basically all companies manufacturing such devices. In particular, that would allow them to pressure or drop any one misbehaving company.
&gt; Providing consumers with information on where to find reputable companies selling repair parts would be a much more palatable alternative to selling them yourself.
That does not really make sense. They are a repair company and the only company selling specialized parts is, of course, the manufacturer.
&gt; also stands in the way of advocating for consumers.
That is much too bleak. They made a deal happen in the first place, which is large progress even if it did not quite work out, and compromises are a fact of life.</span>

                              <span>I think many might not be aware of Starliner&#x27;s sordid history. It has failed essentially every qualification test in various ways. Their pad abort test (where you simulate a launch abort while on the launch pad) resulted in only 2 of the 3 parachutes deploying in beyond optimal conditions. NASA considered that such a resounding success that they let them completely skip the far more challenging in-flight abort test. Their first automated mission to the ISS completely failed and did not make it to the station. NASA finally required a redo from Boeing and their second one did make it to the ISS, but only after experiencing widespread leaks and thruster failures literally identical to the ones that have now left these astronauts stranded.
If SpaceX or another company had remotely similar results, they would never have been greenlit. For instance in spite of a flawless pad abort test, NASA required SpaceX also carry out an in-flight abort. And that&#x27;s completely reasonable - you don&#x27;t simply skip tests, even with optimal performance. Skipping tests following suboptimal performance is simply unjustifiable. And so I think we&#x27;re largely looking at another Challenger type disaster caused by a disconnect between management (and likely political appointees) versus engineering staff, rather than inherent risk. But this is not a vessel that should have ever had a single human anywhere near it, and so their official comments (and even actions) on the situation are going to be heavily biased due to their own behaviors.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, I read a post by Bearly Significant titled: &quot;Headlines Terrify Me&quot;. The post talked about the nuances of creating the perfect headline, that one time they made a typo, and their fear of sabotaging themselves with their words.
The post starts:
Crafting an effective headline is an art form mastered only by the finest journalists and editors. In fewer words than a tweet, all nuances and &quot;yes, buts&quot; must be simplified. This is crucial because journalists are taught to always consider: &quot;if someone only reads the headline, will they be somewhat informed?&quot;
Although the blog post was geared more towards the news sector, I can’t help but think that there is some parallelism with how bloggers craft their blog post titles.
I think everyone has their own flavor of titling their posts that works with their niche, and blogging voice. I follow a few who title their blog posts…
In a super vague way that makes you want to click on the post to understand what their title means
Short and straight to the point - you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into and the topic of the post
A poetic title that encompasses the topic of the post
A few words excerpt from their actual post
…and so on.
I think I do a mixture of some of the above. I tend to lean towards a blog title that evokes the same emotion as what I’m writing about. If it’s a more poetic piece, I title it as such. If it’s more casual, the title also tends to be. Although there are times when my posts tend to be vague, the goal is to rarely make the title vague. I always want you to know what you’re getting into so you can choose to read, or pass on my posts. I hate clickbait, and so I try to avoid that as much as I can.
My blog is pretty straight forward. What you see is typically what you get.

                              <span>Hello fellow blogger,
I found your blog and the &quot;Finding my Blogging Voice&quot; post through Bear&#x27;s &#x27;Most Recent&#x27; feed and felt like writing a reply.
It&#x27;s wonderful to see that you got your first post out there. A good and interesting one too, that many bloggers can relate to. Now that you&#x27;re up and running, the hardest part is over.
I&#x27;ve been in a similar situation myself and understand how you feel. My advice is to not overthink it and just keep writing and posting, writing and posting, writing and posting...
I always find myself thinking I could do better, write better, be better.
We can all do better, and the only way to achieve it is by consistently publishing content. Plus, what we consider our &quot;best writing&quot; today, will be replaced by &quot;even better&quot; soon. Looking back at what I thought was my &quot;best writing ever&quot; five years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t even publish it today.
Besides, we&#x27;re terrible at being our own critics. We&#x27;ll post texts we believe are outstanding, only to see them go by unnoticed. And we&#x27;ll post texts we hesitate to share, which end up being our most read ever.
Blogging is like a school without final exams, that’s what makes it so valuable and rewarding.
Just keep on blogging and never skip class.
Good luck!

The original post by &quot;Thoughtless Ramblings&quot; made ripples in cyberspace. Another great example of the beauty of blogging. A first post was all it took...

I had a hard time finding my voice. I always felt like I needed to perform for someone with my writing. Took me a while to feel comfortable just writing for myself and to get stuff out of my head. And I think the way I see it now is like I&#x27;m doing an impromptu presentation and some people might stop and listen. — Juan Villela</span>

                              <span>Mikasacus recently made a video titled &quot;how to actually love yourself&quot;1 in which he details his own journey towards discovering self-love:
I learned that self-love means giving yourself acceptance for your very being, accepting your flaws, quirks, and failures as a part of you and choosing to respect yourself despite your perceived shortcomings. It means treating yourself with the same respect you would treat anyone else with. You wouldn&#x27;t tell someone something even half as cruel as the things you tell yourself. So why would you tell yourself those things?
His overall message comes down to self-love being something not about vanity but about developing a deep sense of self-assurance, acceptance, and trust with yourself. True self-love involves treating oneself with kindness, respect, and …</span>

 Reports suggested that Blue Carbon—a company privately owned by Sheikh Ahmed al-Maktoum, a member of Dubai&#x27;s ruling family—had signed deals—a land grab enacted in the name of climate change mitigation. In response, Blue Carbon insisted the discussions were merely exploratory and would require (...)

It says that GPT-4 is correct at predicting the experiment outcome direction 69% of the time versus 66% of the time for human forecasters. But this is a silly benchmark because people are not trusting human forecasters in the first place, that&#x27;s the whole purpose for why the experiment is run. Knowing that GPT-4 is slightly better at predicting experiments than some human guessing doesn&#x27;t make it a useful substitute for the actual experiment.</span>

                              <span>I listened to the whole conference and here&#x27;s my impression:
1. NASA manager Steve Stich said there&#x27;s a relatively wide &quot;band of uncertainty&quot; in how risky a Starliner return is. Some (many?) NASA engineers are at the high end of the band and are advocating a return on Dragon instead. Boeing is obviously at the low end of the band and thinks it is a low risk.
The problem is, the data doesn&#x27;t rule out either side of the band. So they are trying to get more data to narrow the uncertainty (in either or both directions). [Interestingly enough, the data from the White Sands testing made them more worried because it revealed the Teflon seal deformation.]
But my sense is that if they don&#x27;t narrow the uncertainty (i.e., convince the NASA engineers) then they will very likely choose a Dragon return.…</span>

Fell off the flow when I had to rasterize our plans, when I tried to add multiple rooms, and again during checkout. PDF support should be a must, ideally multiple room support. Making sure checkout works is also a must.
Path was Navigate to Roometron.com&#x3D;&gt;create account&#x3D;&gt;create new project&#x3D;&gt;go to upload my plans&#x3D;&gt;couldn&#x27;t select my plans&#x3D;&gt;saw site didn&#x27;t support pdf but did webp&#x3D;&gt;google &quot;pdf to webp&quot; converter&#x3D;&gt;found some suspicious sites to upload pdf&#x27;s to&#x3D;&gt;went to chatgpt to write a script to convert pdf to webp&#x3D;&gt;saw the script was converting to png anyways&#x3D;&gt;went back to the roometron site and saw png was supported&#x3D;&gt;brew install poppler webp &#x3D;&gt;&#x60;pdftocairo -png plans.pdf page&#x60;&#x3D;&gt;upload page 1&#x3D;&gt;can&#x27;t find where to upload the rest of the pages for multiple rooms (also my plans have multiple rooms per page)&#x3D;&gt;exit out&#x3D;&gt;seeing as this is a &quot;shown hn&quot; decide I&#x27;ll try again and push through with just the first page of plans only&#x3D;&gt;see I need my square footage for the first page&#x3D;&gt;see its only listed for the floor&#x3D;&gt;manually measure my square footage for the uploaded page&#x3D;&gt;convert to square meters&#x3D;&gt;go to checkout&#x3D;&gt; enter in my credit card info&#x3D;&gt;can&#x27;t scroll down to click &quot;complete purchase&quot; because of a rendering error presumably because the info was autopopulated&#x3D;&gt;quit the credit card flow&#x3D;&gt;attempt the paypal flow despite absolutely loathing paypal&#x3D;&gt;sign into paypal&#x3D;&gt;receive a payment request for $50 not $17&#x3D;&gt;think this doesn&#x27;t look right&#x3D;&gt;quit the flow&#x3D;&gt;try to find a different payment option&#x3D;&gt;exiting the payment flow deletes my project&#x3D;&gt;completely give up here.</span>

                              <span>I’ve built quite a few french drains in residential settings, some lasting longer than others - I’ll share a few hard earned lessons here:
Soil migration is the number one failure mode. This is mentioned but perhaps a bit understated in the video.
To prevent soil migration you absolutely need commercial grade geotextile fabric wrapping the gravel and pipe.
You can buy pipe with much bigger and more numerous holes than the tiny slits depicted in the video. That also obviates the need to decide what orientation the holes should be.
Void space is the most critical factor when choosing gravel. You need a lot of space between the rocks to support fast drainage. Do not use playground pebbles or anything similar. Pay close attention to the type of aggregate you’re buying.
Calculate how much water you actually need to drain. You can use the “100 year flood” values for your locale to get an upper bound on rainfall, then multiple by drainage area. This is especially important if your roof is part of the watershed.
https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/sci...
Sometimes there is insufficient gradient to move the water anywhere, ie the land is too flat. In this case you may be better off building a drywell, which is constructed very similarly.

Most days, I sit down in front of my computer (or phone) and allow myself to just type, see what comes out, and then refine. Other times, I write intentional posts about topics that I have been ruminating on. Then there are moments when my emotions run so strong that I have to express them before I explode. I guess such was the case yesterday.
Of course, there are other ways. I have a list of topics I want to get to one day, but those have been mostly ignored. They overwhelm me too much.
Anyways, that&#x27;s not the intention of this post.
The best topics come to me in the most inopportune times, and so half the time, they never see the light of day. I often find myself coming up with things I want to write about in that space betw…</span>

                              <span>Has labor demand changed since the COVID-19 pandemic? In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.</span>

                              <span>We recently talked with Federico Bongiovanni (Google) and David
Eads (Red Hat), Chairs of SIG API Machinery, to know a bit more about
this Kubernetes Special Interest Group.
Introductions
Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about
yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
David: I started working on
OpenShift (the Red Hat
distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My
first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl
(kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth (RBAC and *Review APIs are ports
from OpenShift), apps (workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others,
but API Machinery is still my favorite :)

                              <span>I want to blog but have never posted. I start a draft and work on it for hours and days, but I never think it&#x27;s good enough. I always think that I could do better, write better, be better. For so long all I&#x27;ve written is essays and official memos, I find it hard to let down my standards and be natural.
My recent resume is working against me; four years of college with essays and lab reports, and a year at a corporate job with professional communications. Writing off the cuff to a casual audience doesn&#x27;t come as easy to me as it once did. Somehow I need to undo the last five years of training and relearn simplicity and sincerity.
This is my first post and I don&#x27;t expect it to make a splash, but rather just a drop in the sea of writers online. My real goal with this post and others are to find my &quot;blogging voice&quot;, a version of myself who can write freely without worrying so much about the particulars.
I&#x27;m afraid this post will join the myriad others on BearBlog in the &quot;meta-blogging&quot; category; blogging about blogging. While that may be true for this first entry, I&#x27;m hoping to expand my writing in the coming months, I just hope someone will join me on that journey.</span>

                              <span>One of the houses I visited at work today had an absolutely stunning view of the sea. I could have easily stayed there all day.
When I mentioned how amazing the location was, the owner of the house replied, &quot;Yeah, but you don&#x27;t think about it after a while.&quot;
It should be illegal to live like that if you don&#x27;t even appreciate it, I thought as I walked back to my car. I started driving away and caught myself...
But what about me? I&#x27;m basically the same.
I don&#x27;t live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.
How often do I think about it? Hardly ever.
Yet, it&#x27;s something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.
Okay, it&#x27;s never going to be like &quot;the first high&quot; again, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Just a tenth of the first experience is still immensely precious and rewarding.
A tiny bit of awareness is all it takes to start observing and appreciating our surroundings. Let&#x27;s remind ourselves of the beauty of the mundane.</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been feeling upset and frustrated about some of the things happening in my life. I’m screaming into the unknown because I’m not really sure what else to do. The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.
Talking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.
I have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.
Every day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.
I just need to figure out how.

I was having a phone call with my best friend last night. I know he&#x27;s going through a really tough time and has been for a while. I felt anxious and stressed about whether or not I could be a good friend / what he needed. I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.
So why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I&#x27;ve always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me. It&#x27;s always been hard for me to get close to even my best friends. I really abused the shit out of &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t need your help&quot;. Despite that, it felt like it really degenerated during lockdowns, to the point where I&#x27;ve had troub…</span>

This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.</span>

 The number of Palestinian causalities is so high compared to previous Israeli attacks, 385 killed and more than 1750 injured (these numbers are valid at 31 December). The majority of Arab masses is only observing what is going on, with lot of outrage and anger, this is due mainly to the general atmosphere of fear and their marginalization that is strongly maintained by the ruling elites. Only a small minority of politically active individuals are participating in the protests on the streets. Those are mainly Islamic activists. This can be understood in two ways: That Hamas, which is leading Gaza strip, is th…</span>
