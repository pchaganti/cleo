The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

                              <span>When a political party loses its legitimacy, its traditional priorities and moral compass, its candidates lose elections.

                              <span>Biden and his ironically-dubbed national security “brain trust” of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have for most of this year been nixing Kiev’s request for such missiles as well as permission for Ukraine use Britain’s Storm Shadow stand-off air-launched long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian targets. They did this arguing that such attacks on the Russian heartland could lead to a spiraling escalation of that war — an escalation that could quickly go nuclear. More

                              <span>J.D, Vance explained in 2020 why he put aside the elitist atheism he picked up in college and law school to become a Catholic (“How I Joined the Resistance,” The Lamp, April 1, 2020). His quest for a meaningful life led Vance to be baptized a Catholic in 2019. The sentiments he so eloquently endorsed in 2020 suggested that in politics he would act as a Pope Francis progressive—the very opposite of a sophist acolyte for Donald J. Trump. Instead, we now see a vice-presidential candidate who lives by what Peter Quinn calls the “Wanton Opportunism” of a “Horatio Hillbilly,” Commonweal, September 8).  Equally problematic, Vance is paired with a presidential candidate who, as Alexander Motyl points out (here, October 20) stops at nothing to boost his own power.

Various US supporters of Donald Trump would argue that his prosecutions also fall under this mantle, despite the fact that he has skated out of almost every attempt to prosecute him so far. However, this  More

On another occasion he said “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the English language. Hmm. And he really has had a love affair with tariffs. After all,  More

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.
So when those times have occurred I&#x27;ve (we&#x27;ve more accurately) adopted what I refer to the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; response to just about anything non-trivial.  &quot;Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take.&quot;  Then you&#x27;ll get asked to &quot;ballpark it&quot; because that&#x27;s what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done &quot;ahead of time&quot; and look good.
Now, I&#x27;ve had good managers who totally didn&#x27;t need this strategy, and I loved &#x27;em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m the first author of the manuscript, so I thought I could answer some of the questions and clarify some issues (all details are in the manuscript, but who has the time to read it ;)
Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.
Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery&#x27;s (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.
Many authors and wasted public funding:…</span>

                              <span>People here seem to be underestimating the advantages that Google gets just because of Chrome:
- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You&#x27;ll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn&#x27;t an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn&#x27;t ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

Western corporate media outlets, without exception, acquiesced to Israeli directives barring reporters from entering Gaza. Journalists embedded with the Israeli army report only what Israel permits them to observe, creating a one-sided, heavily filtered narrative. More

                              <span>In 2002, the state of Gujarat in India erupted in horrific violence that would shape and define Narendra Modi’s political career. The pogrom, which left thousands of Muslims dead and displaced tens of thousands more, demonstrated the ease with which fear and hatred can be weaponised in pursuit of political power. Modi’s right-wing populism, rooted in Hindu fascism, enabled and cemented his rise to national prominence. Today, South Africa risks following a similarly destructive trajectory as political elites increasingly try to incite xenophobia against African and Asian migrants to redirect anger over a devastating economic and social crisis onto vulnerable scapegoats.

The only area where there might be some hope for ending a war is Ukraine, where Rubio has come close to Donald Trump’s position, praising Ukraine for standing up to Russia, but recognizing that the U.S. is funding a deadly “stalemate war” that needs to be “brought to a conclusion.”  More

                              <span>The best thing, by a long way, that Google Scholar has achieved is denying Elsevier &amp; co a monopoly on academic search.
In most universities here in New Zealand, articles have to be published in a journal indexed by Elsevier&#x27;s Scopus. Not in a Scopus-indexed journal, it does not count anymore than a reddit comment. This gives Elsevier tremendous power. But in CS/ML/AI most academics and students turn to Google Scholar first when doing searches.</span>

                              <span>normally, i avoid &quot;metaposting&quot; about social media. discussions about the pros and cons of social media end up being very insular and kind of repetitive, and it&#x27;s pretty tiring to me. but i need a place to process my thoughts, and well, that&#x27;s what this blog is for.
i stopped using twitter sometime in 2022, before Musk took over. the psychic damage that the wretched bird site was doing to me was unbearable, and it was impacting my physical health in a very tangible way. i couldn&#x27;t do it. if it meant dropping off the surface of the earth to anyone who primarily used twitter, then so be it.
tumblr was also driving me insane, so i hid away on cohost for the entirety of that site&#x27;s lifespan. i&#x27;ve written enough about mourning cohost; so to put it succinctly, it was a website that i really need…</span>

                              <span>I feel like the peak internet for me was some time around 2004. The internet felt balanced, and I was happy with my relationship with it. Sure, I probably spent more time than I should have on the internet, but at least I wasn&#x27;t carrying it around with me. I wasn&#x27;t surfing the web on my bathroom breaks or while standing in line at the grocery store. The internet was a tool, not a conqueror of my attention.
For years, I&#x27;ve talked about wanting to set up a desktop or a designated computer space. Some place where I have go and sit down in order to log on. A place where I&#x27;ll keep my computer off and give myself a few seconds to decide whether looking up an actress in some random sitcom episode is truly worth the effort. I want to add a little friction to my computing and just see how my mental health responds. Will I feel better? Will my attention improve? These are the questions I&#x27;m curious about.
Being that I have a little free time on my hands, I thought now is as good of a time as ever to give this a shot. So, starting tonight at midnight, I&#x27;m disconnecting. For the next week, my MacBook will live on my dining room table. I&#x27;m uninstalling most of the apps that I use on my phone to make it as bare-bones as possible. My iPad will remain on, but with the Wi-Fi turned off. I have a lot of magazines downloaded courtesy of Archive.org and some books I plan to read with my free time.
I wonder how my browsing habits will change if I don&#x27;t have a piece of technology at my fingertips. Will I feel compelled to keep up with as much, or will I just find other mindless activities to fill my time? Heck, I even wonder if I&#x27;ll make it the whole week. But these are the questions I will hopefully have an answer to around this time next week. With that being said, if anyone needs to contact me e-mail is going to be your best bet, because I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll check that, but I&#x27;m probably going to miss a lot elsewhere.

                              <span>Spoiler Alert: I indeed was not patient enough.
For the past few days, I’ve been contemplating abandoning my Moleskine journal for my newly acquired Hobonici notebook1. One main reason is that ever since I started writing with fountain pens, I’ve discovered that the bleed through on my Moleskine is just something I can no longer stand. I’ve been diligently writing with my favorite Kaco pen, but now that my Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen has arrived, I really want to start journaling with it. Being absolutely impatient, and accepting that life is short and I should use a journal that sparks joy2, I made the switch today. I only had 14 pages left, so I don&#x27;t actually feel AS guilty.
I have new notebook anxiety. I love buying journals, and stationery in general, but writing on that first …</span>

whoa, i love your blog theme. super cute, sleek, while still very functional... i love it! definitely adding your blog to my rss feeds, i&#x27;ve liked your posts so far!
love the look of the blog.
I wanted to make it reminiscent to some elements from my art archive, but keep it pretty simple, both because Bear is pretty minimal by nature &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to let my perfectionist side take over.

In the 1999 movie adaption of Steven King&#x27;s The Green Mile, the guards go into the condemned man&#x27;s cell to ask about the arrangements for his execution. They want to know his last meal request and if he wants a preacher to be with him. Ultimately, they even ask if he wants a chance to escape. The prisoner, named John Coffey, tells them he&#x27;s ready to go, starting his speech with a resigned &quot;I&#x27;m tired boss.&quot; Brother, I can relate.

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.
Hard disagree. If you cant decompose to avoid &quot;wonky parameters&quot; then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.
IME &quot;heavy&quot; function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.</span>

I&#x27;ve got some small/tiny gamedev projects on my pocket that I haven&#x27;t documented here in my Bearblog account. The first one is an ASCII Snake game only using the curses library. There will be another similar post on making Snake game using Raylib.

                              <span>For me, it takes a long time to create something like the Bear Micro Blog. An &quot;unnecessarily&quot; long time.
Partly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an amateur. But that&#x27;s not the main reason. Nor is it a matter of perfection.
It&#x27;s because I find it relaxing.
Coding is like meditation for me. A perfect blend of focus and relaxation—a kind of timeless void. I&#x27;m often surprised when I look at the clock and realize how much time has passed.
They say time is money. Considering how rewarding these precious moments are to me, it’s a bargain.</span>

1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.
2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.
So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”</span>

Title: The Gaza Ghetto Uprising
Date: May 2024
Source: 

 TO THE HEART OF IT: Gaza has been a free kill zone and a “concentration camp” (to quote Israel’s National Security Director Giora Eiland in 2004), long before October 7. 
 In light of this, the most radical position comes directly from the simplest question: are Palestinians human beings? If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. 
 Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…</span>

                              <span>&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?
All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.</span>

                              <span>Inspired by Sylvia and mgx, I decided to create a Bear Micro Blog, or status log, or shorts page – whatever you want to call it.
It&#x27;s quite a simple solution, using tags and the Bear class_name snippet. Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I&#x27;m planning to create an Apple Shortcut.
I&#x27;ve also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:
RSS Feed for All Content
RSS Feed for Blog Posts
RSS feed for Status Updates
Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.
Wishing you a great weekend!
Update: Here&#x27;s a tutorial.</span>

                              <span>Let’s talk about tech interviews – specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you’re a developer who’s been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I’m talking about. It’s becoming a trend, and it’s not helping anyone.
Unrealistic Tests That Don’t Measure Real Skills
These high-stress, solo coding assignments don’t reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they’d never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures “problem-solving” skills.
The Hidden Time Sink
What companies often ignore is the extra time cand…</span>

                              <span>Letters of recommendation from faculty advisors play a critical role in the job market for Ph.D. economists. At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate’s potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.</span>

                              <span>I’m realizing that what bothers me about teaching is everything feels way too important. In prepping my lessons, the slides, the activities, etc., I have to always be thinking about how all those things affect the kids. How do they enhance their understanding? How do they engage them? Could I be more flexible in certain areas, or are there skills or topics I really need the kids to understand in a certain way? How can I design this class such that they interact more with each other, have more agency over their learning, can keep up?
Dropping the ball on any aspect of teaching feels huge. When a lesson flops, I feel like I wasted my kids’ time and mine. My evenings are spent thinking about how to get the next one right. There’s no part of this job where I feel I can relax my grip or afford …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s cold enough this week to make me pause at the coat closet before I leave the apartment. Choosing poorly can mean the difference between being cozy and getting sick. Hand &amp; body cream have appeared in the bathrooms at work (though only the wheelchair accessible ones, which really makes you think). These feel like the real signs that winter is here, not a date on the calendar. Are they going to change what months count as winter when the daily average high in November climbs to the sixties every year?
The office is eerily quiet. A and her posse are out of town for a work retreat, and I&#x27;m the only one left behind sitting in their pod of desks. I miss chatting with them and being yanked from my daydreams when they come by with treats. Their absence reminds me how much happier I am now tha…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of a weird time for me right now. I quit my job last week without having another one lined up. My wife is going through a lot of things right now, and me being home hasn&#x27;t been the best thing for our bank account but I think it&#x27;s the best thing for us right now. Sadly, all of this came together at the same time as the election, my birthday, and the upcoming holidays which is making for an even more stressful time than typical.
To make matters a bit worse, I haven&#x27;t felt good about retreating into the places that I typically do. A lot of my blogging friends are in pain over the election. My Mastodon feed is depressing, as is most of my RSS. So, I haven&#x27;t really had a place to just breathe online, which has led me to avoid the internet more than usual. Granted, that isn&#x27;t a bad thi…</span>

We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group. We talked about the poor man’s David Tennant in our group and B’s weird partner who made them a really elaborate card that B felt burdened by. The conversation was vivid and true to life, and I texted B about it when …</span>

                              <span>Ask me anything - Do you consider blogging to be an art form?
One thing I absolutely despise is elitism is any form, followed closely by gatekeeping. Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It&#x27;s an attempt to bring something conjured in one&#x27;s creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.

Title: Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot
Subtitle: The necessity to write our own histories
Date: November 9th, 2024
Source: Retrieved on November 14th 2024 from https://bccounterinfo.org/2024/11/09/yintah-documentary-film-review-anarchists-in-the-blind-spot-or-the-necessity-to-write-our-own-histories/

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them.

Yes there seems to be lots of potential. Yes we can brainstorm things that should work. Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it&#x27;s a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to hide those from them.
Show me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.
LLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don&#x27;t have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It&#x27;s a really hard problem with LLM based tools.
There is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.</span>

                              <span>Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we&#x27;ve exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?
I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It&#x27;s my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.
GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.
For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build &quot;expert bots&quot; that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.
If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.
Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.
Chasing after model improvements and &quot;GPT-5 will be PHD-level&quot; is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.
Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don&#x27;t know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.
Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That&#x27;s a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit &quot;weird&quot; (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.</span>

                              <span>I have a bit of uneasiness about how this is heavily pushing GitHub actions as the correct way to publish to PyPI. I had to check PEP740 to make sure it was not directly supported by Microsoft.
&gt; The generation and publication of attestations happens by default, and no changes are necessary for projects that meet all of these conditions: publish from GitHub Actions; via Trusted Publishing; and use the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action to publish.
If you then click on &quot;The manual way&quot; it adds a big disclaimer:
&gt; STOP! You probably don&#x27;t need this section; it exists only to provide some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading work. If you&#x27;re an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the official workflows described above.
Where the only official workflow is &quot;Use GitHub Actions&quot;.
I guess I am an idealist but as a maintainer this falls short of my expectations  for the openness of Python and PyPI.</span>

&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; The Onion, with the help of the Sandy Hook families, has purchased InfoWars.
&gt; We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website.
&gt; We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off.
&gt; I can&#x27;t wait to show you what we have cooked up.

As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP&#x27;s mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who&#x27;d been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn&#x27;t remember the game. OP&#x27;s mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.</span>

This reminds me of a desire I&#x27;ve had for a long time: a simple, wall-mountable eInk device that could be configured with a URL (+wifi creds) and render a markdown file, refreshing once every hour or so. It would be so useful for so many applications – I&#x27;m a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless. I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple of hundred dollars per device for a solid version of such a thing, if it could be mounted and then recharged every month or two.</span>

                              <span>Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!
Here&#x27;s a start --
&quot;Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc&quot;: No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
&quot;Who uses Keras in production&quot;: Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn&#x27;t all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
&quot;Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019&quot;: I didn&#x27;t! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!</span>

                              <span>Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China&#x27;s income level. We quantify China&#x27;s consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country&#x27;s production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.</span>
