                              <span>This week on CounterPunch Radio, Erik Wallenberg and Joshua Frank interview M.V. Ramana on nuclear power and why it&#x27;s not an answer to the climate crisis. Ramana is the Simons Chair in Disarmament, Global and Human Security and Professor at the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. He is the author of The Power of Promise: Examining Nuclear Energy in India (Penguin Books, 2012) and co-editor of Prisoners of the Nuclear Dream (Orient Longman, 2003). Ramana is a member of the International Panel on Fissile Materials, the Canadian Pugwash Group, the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group, and the team that produces the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Leo Szilard Award from the American Physical Society.

                              <span>Large utilities make their money by repairing and expanding the energy grid. Residential solar directly threatens that revenue stream because it doesn’t rely on an ever-expanding network of power stations and transmission lines. The electricity that residential solar power produces typically remains at the community level or, better yet, in the home itself, especially if coupled with local battery storage. Not surprisingly then, by 2018, 20 transmission lines had been canceled in California, mainly because so many homes were already producing solar power on their own rooftops, saving $2.6 billion in total consumer energy costs.

                              <span>Volumes in Kubernetes have been described by two attributes: their storage class, and
their capacity. The storage class is an immutable property of the volume, while the
capacity can be changed dynamically with volume
resize.
This complicates vertical scaling of workloads with volumes. While cloud providers and
storage vendors often offer volumes which allow specifying IO quality of service
(Performance) parameters like IOPS or throughput and tuning them as workloads operate,
Kubernetes has no API which allows changing them.
We are pleased to announce that the VolumeAttributesClass
KEP,
alpha since Kubernetes 1.29, will be beta in 1.31. This provides a generic,
Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO.
Like all new volume features in Kubernetes, this API is…</span>

                              <span>Kubernetes is renowned for its robust orchestration of containerized applications,
but as clusters grow, the demands on the control plane can become a bottleneck.
A key challenge has been ensuring strongly consistent reads from the etcd datastore,
requiring resource-intensive quorum reads.
Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a major improvement:
consistent reads from cache, graduating to Beta in Kubernetes v1.31.
Why consistent reads matter
Consistent reads are essential for ensuring that Kubernetes components have an accurate view of the latest cluster state.
Guaranteeing consistent reads is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of Kubernetes operations,
enabling components to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

                              <span>I&#x27;d echo the sentiment that this is amazing, and that a TV guide would be awesome.
I&#x27;d also suggest maybe adding the channel names (like the comment you posted here) to the app itself (although i think it&#x27;s cool when it&#x27;s unnamed and you get the old-school feeling of channels just being numbers).
Also, I&#x27;d love to have permalinks for the channels. Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you&#x27;re watching right now.
Another thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called &quot;SoundFixer&quot; that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it&#x27;s super distracting), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they&#x27;re embedded. I don&#x27;t know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It&#x27;s probably too niche and hard to do though.
Also I don&#x27;t seem to find any volume control except mute?</span>

That builds in a FOMO trade-off which causes user to automatically/subconciously decide on channel they most want to watch, because they can&#x27;t watch everything.</span>

                              <span>The bug in the legal system is that by filing this motion/claim, Disney can only win.
In the unlikely best case, they get the case dismissed, but even in the most likely case that the motion is denied, they win by wearing down their opponent who has much more limited resources and is personally affected by the case dragging out, i.e. more likely to accept a (lower) settlement than without this tactic. The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs.
Courts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics. If using such a tactic turned the claim from &quot;you killed this person negligently&quot; to &quot;you killed this person negligently, then willfully tried sleazy tricks to create additional suffering for the husband&quot;, and had the potential to double the award, companies would be much less eager to play this game.</span>

                              <span>If the agreement at the time is anything like the current agreement, this is a serious misrepresentation to the court.
The terms do require Disney+ users to &quot;agree to resolve, by binding individual arbitration as provided below, all Disputes&quot; with some IP exceptions.
But &quot;Disputes&quot; is a term of art that &quot;includes any claim, dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or common law, between you and Disney concerning the Disney Products or this Agreement&quot; (emphasis added).
What are the Disney Products? They are &quot;certain websites, software, applications, content, products, and services in any media format or channel.&quot;
I hope the lawyers get sanctioned and disbarred.</span>

For decades now, the international media, of almost all political persuasions, has either ignored the often historic events taking place in Catalonia, or presented them in a way that would not displease Madrid&#x27;s rulers, of all persuasions, including the nostalgics of Franco.

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

In yesterday’s post, we proposed a methodology to evaluate the ampleness of reserves in real time based on the slope of the reserve demand curve—the elasticity of the federal (fed) funds rate to reserve shocks. In this post, we propose a suite of complementary indicators of reserve ampleness that, jointly with our elasticity measure, can help policymakers ensure that reserves remain ample as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet.</span>

- Western Industry.
- The blue-collar middle class
- The Middle Class
- Our health care system
- Our education
- Western Economic Leadership.
- Social Mobility
Now they are busy destroying western technology, science and innovation on their never-ending selfish wealth-extraction quest.
They convinced us that our homes are investments, so they can fleece us with their usurary schemes. So, what next? our organs?
They convinced us to exchange our pensions for the privilege of being the mark on a market where the sharks like them do whatever the fuck they want, from blatant insider trading, to pump and dump schemes, to outright fraud, having for all practical purposes bought the SEC a long time ago.
What they will kill next?
How long are we going to transfer wealth to those slimmy sweet talking ignorant greedy bean counters?
Our daily work is like being in a mad house because almost everything is subordinated to the the most sacred goal of cooking the next quarter numbers to ensure we maximize executive bonuses, and fuck the long run! crazy projects started, spin offs, merges, projects cancelled, company killing layoffs, fuck long term value generation! they want more and more, and more, and they fucking want it right now! the fucking bonus gollums.
Everything is fucked in our society but executive compensation. Xerox, HP, IBM, Boeing... How many other proud symbols of our economy and civilization are we going to let them destroy?</span>

                              <span>As Kubernetes continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of
container orchestration, the community has decided to move cgroup v1 support
into maintenance mode in v1.31.
This shift aligns with the broader industry&#x27;s move towards cgroup v2, offering
improved functionalities: including scalability and a more consistent interface.
Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let&#x27;s take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for
maintaining system performance and ensuring that…</span>

                              <span>Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the &quot;PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime&quot; feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.
For more details, read about
Phase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.

                              <span>The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates. To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.</span>

The following is a preliminary draft of the preface to the Turkish edition of my book Post-Anarchism and Psychoanalysis, which will be published in a few months.
 This book is the result of spoken improvisations that occurred during a strange period of wandering. I was removed from my position as Professor and Chair of Sociology at a major Russian university due in part to a renewed military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The consequent wandering extended also to the streets of Tomsk, Sochi, Nur Sultan, Vienna, and Budapest, before arriving for a prolonged residential retreat in Cork, Ireland, under a temporary protection order from the Europe…</span>

It&#x27;s important to recognize any time that we&#x27;re talking about the market that services charge what they can, not what is fair. The market does not have a concept of fairness, only competition. This is why there is no such thing as a benevolent monopoly that charges fair prices - because fairness does not exist in the market, only competition.
BUT... since fairness gets so often brought into conversations about Apple&#x27;s fees, often with the implicit suggestion that Apple &quot;deserves&quot; to be compensated for all of the work they&#x27;re putting into hosting and curating apps and for (in heavy quotes) &quot;creating&quot; a market that they supposedly also don&#x27;t have duopoly control over: does anybody want to argue that Apple hosting the Patreon app on iOS provides more value to Patreon subscribers and creators than the existence of Patreon itself does?
Like, if we&#x27;re going to talk about what&#x27;s egregious and what&#x27;s not egregious, charging higher fees per-transaction than the platforms you are hosting seems like it might be a good indicator that things have gotten out of control.</span>

                              <span>Apple has quietly been one of the biggest culprits in the proliferation of subscription software. They still don&#x27;t support upgrades/upgrade pricing. Subscriptions are also the easiest way to implement a software demo or trial in the App Store. Finally they use their control of the App Store to coerce anyone doing something different than monthly/yearly subscriptions into that model (as we see here).
It sucks big time.</span>

                              <span>As a longtime YouTube creator who uses Patreon for financial support, the news is terrible: Patreon informed me that all creators must switch to a monthly subscription schedule instead of the per-creation schedule that I and many other currently use. The whole point of per-creation is that it allows me to take time off, and only charge people when I release something, thus incentivizing me, and being fair to my supporters. I&#x27;m really annoyed by this change, and will start pushing back, but if it happens as planned, I may be forced to switch to another platform, or come up with some other solution.</span>

                              <span>The world where Apple is just completely fine with Apple users paying $13 instead of $10 for a subscription if they do it through an app is an interesting one.
Obviously this makes a lot of money for them but when you think about it they must think very little of their customers treating them with disrespect like this. This is how &#x27;Tim Cook&#x27;s Apple&#x27; should be remembered.</span>

                              <span>I remember reading that per-creation billing is a very important feature for Patreon creators, because it removes the moral obligation to produce content just to justify a subscription.
If Patreon really doesn&#x27;t want to kill the feature itself, but is just responding to Apple&#x27;s enforcement, then it seems like a really clear illustration of monopoly power - pushing unrelated markets to change their own structure and products just to fit Apple&#x27;s preferred billing flow.</span>

                              <span>Go is everything I don’t want in a language for my personal projects. It’s verbose, every simple task feels like a lot to write. It’s not expressive, what would be a one-liner in Python makes you write three for loops in Go. I constantly need to find workarounds for the lack of proper enums, lack of sum types, no null safety etc.
I’m sure these are the exact reasons why Go is good for enterprise software, but for personal projects, I get no fun out of using it</span>

                              <span>People always under-estimate the cost of properly learning a language.  At any given time I tend to have a &quot;main go-to language&quot;.  I typically spend 2-4 years getting to the point where I can say I &quot;know&quot; a language.  Then I try to stick to it long enough for the investment to pay off.  Usually 8-10 years.
A surprising number of people think this is a very long time. It isn&#x27;t.  This is typically the time it takes to understand enough of the language, the compiler, the runtime, the standard library, and idiomatic ways to do things.  It is the time it takes to where you can start to meaningfully contribute to evolving how the language is used and meaningfully coach architects, programmers and system designers. It is also what you need to absorb novices into the organization and train them fast.</span>

Title: Can Stoicism Be Reconciled With Anarchy?

How can Stoicism, a philosophy that has largely come down to us from the hierarchical, centralised, statist, Roman Empire and whose most famous adherent was an absolute Monarch, be reconciled with Anarchy?
 At first consideration Anarchy and Stoicism seem unlikely bedfellows. Much of Stoicism has come down to us through the Roman&#x27; Late Stoa&#x27; of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Seneca was a Billionaire slave-owner politician, and Marcus Aurelius was an absolute monarch… but Epictetus was a disabled enslaved person,…</span>

Declaration at the trial (October 30 2013) for the wounding of Ansaldo Nucleare managing director Roberto Adinolfi
 ‘Nobody can judge me 
 Not even you 
 The truth hurts you, I know.’ 
 C. Caselli 
 A few words to make a few simple points before the ‘truth’ is pronounced by the court; just in case it’s not clear, I am using the word ‘truth’ ironically as I don’t recognize any tribunal other than my own conscience. The only ones responsible for what happened in Genoa on May 7 2012 are Alfredo and myself. None of our friends or comrades knew what we were planning and then carried out.

 “The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.” 
 - The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin 
 We in the Libertarian Socialist Caucus (LSC) of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) recognize that our formation has dual obligations, both to the development of the socialist movement in the United States and to the broader libertarian socialist movement that exists outside of DSA. While much of our caucus’ focus thus far has been on DSA’s internal politics, we believe in cross-pollination with the broader libertarian left via an …</span>

&gt; If you express this value in any other units, the magic immediately disappears. So, this is no coincidence
Ordinarily, this would be extremely indicative of a coincidence. If you’re looking for a heuristic for non-coincidences, “sticks around when you change units” is the one you want. This is just an unusual case where that heuristic fails.</span>

                              <span>Was shocked to hear this news. I worked for Google years ago but I was in the NYC office, so we didn&#x27;t run into the YouTube folks much.
Opinions about YouTube may be mixed here on HN, but it is objectively one of the most successful businesses in tech or media to emerge in the past 15 years. If it weren&#x27;t buried inside Alphabet, Youtube would be worth on the order of $400 billion, more than Disney and Comcast combined. It&#x27;s a weird mix of a huge creator monetization network, a music channel, an education platform, a forever-store of niche content, and a utility.
It&#x27;s also not a business that rested on it&#x27;s laurels. It&#x27;s easy to forget how novel creator monetization was when YouTube adopted it. They do a lot of active work to manage their creators, and now have grown into a music and podcast platform that is challenging Apple. To top it off, YouTube TV, despite costing just as much as cable, is objectively a good product.
Few products have the brand, the reach, monetization, and the endurance that YouTube has had within Google. And I know for a fact that this is in no small part due to the way it was managed.
I&#x27;ve probably watched tens of thousands of hours of YouTube at this point. Some of it sublime, some of it absurd, some of it critical for my work or my degree. I couldn&#x27;t imagine a world without it.

Edit: some people misinterpreted my comment. I&#x27;m just one anonymous  voice on the Internet, but am deeply saddened by the passing of Susan Wojcicki, who meant a lot to me as one of the many people who crossed paths with her professionally. I wish her family strength in a very trying moment. She did not deserve this. I&#x27;ve not met another business leader demonstrate everyday kindness to the degree that she did.
Her untimely passing is also a reminder to those of us who sometimes look up to such successful businesspeople that we should all appreciate our luck to be alive and enjoy it to the fullest, as I hope that she did as well, and as I&#x27;m sure that she&#x27;d prefer we did. RIP</span>

I like to imagine some kind of engineering “meet cute” whereby, one random day, the headlights engineer and the parking radar engineer happen to be working on the front of the car together.  Their eyes meet:
“hey, I’m John — I didn’t know you had an ECU here!”,
“hi, I’m Claire — wow, you have an ECU right up front too?  It’s, like, right next to mine and we never knew!”
“I know, crazy right?!  Hey this is going to sound really forward and I don’t normally do this but I’m only running at 70% compute capacity.  I don’t suppose you need any real-time budget this evening?”
“So funny you should ask, I was just about to run a whole bunch of heavy new wiring to…”
And in a story as old as time they get ECU married and raise their control loops in the same front-of-vehicle ECU together instead of living their separate, lonely, ECU-right-next-to-each-other-and-they-didn’t-know-it lives.</span>

                              <span>Seems weird to start with “not talking about using something like SQLite where your data is still serialized”, then end up with a home grown transaction log that requires serialization and needs to be replicated, which is how databases are replicated anyway.
If your load fits entirely on one server, then just run the database on that damn server and forget about “special architectures to reduce round-trips to your database”. If your data fits entirely in RAM, then use a ramdisk for the database if you want, and replicate it to permanent storage with standard tools. Now that’s actually simple.</span>
