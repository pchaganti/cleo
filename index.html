Not to mention the blockade in Alberta where they were found with guns and a pipe bomb, with their communications indicating they were planning to murder the RCMP officers on site!

                              <span>Patio11 has some good coverage of Trudeau&#x27;s handling of the trucker protest against the government&#x27;s handling of COVID-19 [1].
Whatever you think of the truckers&#x27; position or protest tactics, any punishment for their actions ought to go through the laws and court system.  Trudeau instead essentially told the banking system &quot;You can&#x27;t do business with those people, they&#x27;re terrorists.&quot;  Patio11&#x27;s words of what happened next:
&quot;The assistant deputy finance minister...said...&#x27;The intent was not to get at the families&#x27;, and when a democratic government starts a sentence that way something deeply #*&amp;$#ed up has happened.&quot;
I&#x27;m not on the pulse of Canadian politics, so I don&#x27;t really know what sins or political circumstances have led Trudeau to this point, or if he has any redeeming qualities.  Personally, I&#x27;m glad to see him gone.

                              <span>&gt; Word processors like MacWrite absolutely transformed the ways that everyone used computers.
MacWrite was released 5 years after WordPerfect, which itself is predated by WordStar. I don&#x27;t get why Apple fans have this obsession with pretending Apple invents these things.
Apple refines what others have attempted before, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re good at. Part of the reason people are disappointed with Apple these days is because of this fantasy image of Apple as an inventor.</span>

                              <span>Now having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one&#x27;s team (/one&#x27;s department) and market oneself (one&#x27;s team) to your manager (/your company).
So much mental bandwidth was spent.
I also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete InputOutput expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you&#x27;ve effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is &#x27;number of suicides averted&#x27;. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that&#x27;s instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you&#x27;re doing X, but you&#x27;re really doing Y. Because you&#x27;re disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m amused that neither the LLM or the author identified one of the simplest and most effective optimizations for this code: Test if the number is  max _before_ doing the digit sum. It&#x27;s a free 5.5x speedup that renders some of the other optimizations, like trying to memoize digit sums, unnecessary.
On an m1 macbook pro, using numpy to generate the random numbers, using mod/div to do digit sum:
Base: 55ms
Test before digit sum: 7-10ms, which is pretty close to the numba-optimized version from the post with no numba and only one line of numpy. Using numba slows things down unless you want to do a lot of extra work of calculating all of the digit sums in advance (which is mostly wasted).
The LLM appears less good at identifying the big-o improvements than other things, which is pretty consistent with my experience using them to write code.</span>

This may be an underestimation, as Psychiatric News reported later in 2024, “More than 1,500 intravenous (IV) infusion clinics have proliferated nationwide.” Ketamine industry revenues of $3.1 billion were reported in 2022, and projected to be $6.9 billion by 2030.

                              <span>One of the reasons I’m having difficulty “enjoying the holidays” is the editorial writing of Bret Stephens.  His columns defending Israel’s brutal military campaign that targets sanctuary areas and so-called safe zones in Gaza are typically chauvinistic and bellicose.  Stephens supports any Israeli military option that “advances Israel’s national interests on all fronts.”  His lecture at Harvard last year argued that “taking out most, but not all, of Hamas is not enough,” which seems to justify the genocidal campaign that Israel conducts.  Stephens has never mentioned that this campaign targets Gaza’s hospitals and health infrastructure.  As for those who protest Israeli actions, Stephens calls them “Iran’s useful idiots” and anti-semites.

                              <span>Listen for the silences in the imperialist press. Last Saturday’s New York Times included a story it billed online as “What to Know About Gaza’s Humanitarian Crisis.” The Times relayed some of the horrific suffering being inflicted on the people of Gaza. It reported that Israel’s bombs have “turned [Gazan] cities into rubble-filled wastelands” and  More

He takes one hike and throws away 60m. Doesn’t try to find anything interesting to do at Atlassian just calls his coworkers NPCs. This is zero-empathy Peter Pan syndrome at its worse.
Sad how he just goes adventure hopping to try and find meaning. The problem is no matter where you are you are also there. Time to look inward and not outward.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think you have to have Fuck You Money to get to this point. Most people eventually become disillusioned with work enough that they reevaluate what matters to them. Getting a very profitable exit is just one way to trigger that experience.
In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I&#x27;m not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It&#x27;s a way of taking back control.
When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I&#x27;ve nurtured...a lot more than what I&#x27;ve built, in most ways. I&#x27;ve heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like &quot;I now enjoy making other people rich.&quot;
No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.</span>

I think his problem is his identity (founder of Loom) suddenly disappeared.
Now he needs to develop a new identity.
This is especially difficult for single founders without kids (in the sense that people with spouse/kids already derive much of their identity from those 2 things).

That&#x27;s a CAN-SPAM act violation.
FTC: &quot;Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.&quot;[1]
Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.
The actual regulation text:
§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.
Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient&#x27;s electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:
(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or
(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).
That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.

One that&#x27;s centered around &quot;you&quot; and filled with thousands/millions of LLM bots praising you, treating you like a celebrity, etc. Each of your posts will get tens of thousands of &quot;likes&quot;, hundreds of comments, etc. Dm&#x27;s straight to your feed, people wanting you, etc etc.
If the newsfeed is already mostly &quot;the algorithm&quot;, might as well take it to the extreme. I bet tons of people would get addicted to the dopamine hit of celebrity status (whether it&#x27;s bots or not).</span>

Rejection from journals is like rejection from VCs -- it happens all the time and often not for any good reason.

                              <span>Hilarious irony:
&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an &quot;epsilon loss&quot; in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.
&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!</span>
