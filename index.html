                              <span>I am tired of talking about J.D. Vance. And I’m not one for introspection (just ask my husband). But as a daughter of Appalachia and a professor of anthropology at a public university, J.D. Vance’s claim to represent Appalachia and his threats to attack our nation’s universities and their professors, who he’s labeled “the enemy,” are personal for me. Echoing other Appalachia-raised writers who have recently weighed in, I say to J.D. Vance: you are a hillbilly phony (Caleb Miller). You don’t represent us (Neema Avashia). And you can keep your “elegy” (Ivy Brashear) because hillbillies don’t need one (Meredith McCarroll). Your Hillbilly Elegy is a political platform disguised as a memoir, and I call bullshit. More

                              <span>Deputy Sean Grayson didn’t turn on his body camera until after he’d shot Sonya Massey three times. This is probably why he thought he could get away with saying he killed Massey in self-defense, as she was charging toward him with a pot of boiling water. What Grayson didn’t realize is that his partner’s body cam recorded the entire fatal encounter, showing that the diminutive, unarmed Massey was hiding from the Springfield deputy, when Grayson walked around the kitchen counter, shot her in the face and left her to bleed out. Then he lied about it…lies that were caught on tape and exposed as lies on tape. More

An upcoming anniversary should remind us of what sent us down this undemocratic path. More

If you are Black, trans/queer, and operating in good faith, feel free to highlight passages you would like to learn more about. Medium allows authors to interact with their readers. I might be able to provide clarification if I have spoons.

 The ghost of Turgenev crying 
 “Enough!” 
 Is in my ears 
 My activities are glorious 
 While several seasons 
 Fighting disease 
 Living closely with personal existential uncertainty 
 My body is marked 
 There is a thin line 
 Across my left eyelid 
 A scar from where it was removed 
 I am tired of this 
 There is a book 
 Being written 
 The first section poems like this 
 I wonder if it’s my last 
 I don’t know

 All things are possible 
 So say Shestov and Fondane 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 Including the impossibility 
 Of my writing another book after this 
 Yes, all things are possible

 For all life

It Doesn’t Have to Be This Way, You Know
 There is a beauty that creeps in under the plastic blinds, covering the window, in the form of sunlight. A beauty that seems an attempt by the world outside to draw some contrast to the words I write here, and that you will read later on. That for all the expression of pain, and dissatisfaction, and desire for more, there is still beauty to be found here, bouncing around the walls of this mold infested apartment.

A Few Words From the Distro
 Riding freight is a core skill for anti-work, anti-school, individualist anarchists, lifestylists, nomads, oogles, crust punk dirty kids, and travelers. 
 Hate your job? Quit and go train hopping! 
 Sick of school? Drop out and go train hopping! 
 Feeling suicidal with no fun and excitement in your life? 
 Try something new, open a new chapter and go train hopping! 
 But train hopping is very dangerous! You SERIOUSLY could die. 
 But you could also die in a car wreck on the way to work, or die from getting shot to death by a mass shooter.

PREFACE
 Welcome to the collective book on collective process! Over the course of the twenty or so years that AK Press has been publishing and distributing anarchist and radical literature, we&#x27;ve gotten a lot of requests for good, short overviews of topics that are of interest to the folks in our communities: anarchism, worker&#x27;s rights, solidarity economics, and countless other things. We do our best to seek out books to publish or distribute that meet our readers’ needs, but it can take a while to find exactly the right author or book.

 The formation of Buddhist socialism in Japan made a belated start and its influence was little compared with that of Christian socialism in Europe, or even with the revolutionary movement (1851-1864) which occurred in the period of “idle peace” started by Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全) in China. The reason for the belated start seems to be indirectly concerned with national isolationism and the slow development of capitalism in Japan.

Title: Hamas, anarchists in the West and Palestine solidarity
Subtitle: An analysis

Notes: Anonymous author from Stoking the Embers Collective

 In the West, it is practically impossible to speak publicly about Hamas in any way that isn&#x27;t an outright and total condemnation. Behind such remarkable limitation of the spectrum of public debate lies the idea that Hamas represents an &quot;evil&quot; so deep that it lacks any complexity. In parliaments, universities and newspapers, Hamas is never discussed, simply because -- it is assumed -- there is nothing to discuss.

                              <span>Thank you, rsc, for all your work.  Development in Go has become much more enjoyable in these 12 years: race detector, standardized error wrapping, modules, generics, toolchain updates, and so on.  And while there are still things to be desired (sum types, better enum/range types, immutability, and non-nilness in my personal wishlist), Go is still the most enjoyable ecosystem I&#x27;ve ever developed in.</span>

                              <span>Safety guys always ruin the fun.  I was in the Marine Corps and every time we got to test some new piece of gear the safety officer was like &quot;No, you can&#x27;t live fire it off the flight deck of the ship&quot; or &quot;No, not here, that village is down wind of the dust you will kick up when it goes off.&quot; No, that has a kill distance of 6 miles, you have to fire it into a hill.&quot;  Blah, blah, blah.
So after I got out I joined the National Guard.</span>

                              <span>So I laser weld, and beyond my own PPE, interlocks (gun won&#x27;t fire if it&#x27;s not touching metal, etc), the most important part of the whole setup is laser safety curtains.
Because it&#x27;s a 2500 watt laser, if i didn&#x27;t have laser safety curtains , the relections/etc could very easily blind someone at a fairly long distance.
The NOHD (nominal ocular hazard distance) is something like 10km (2500 watt laser, 0.06mm spot size, divergence is very very small).  The actual hazard distance is shorter, but still, kinda crazy.
(as for why i have a laser welder - i got it cheap and besides the downsides above, it is very easy to weld ~anything without much skill.  A person who has never welded in their life can weld sheet metal and have it come out basically perfect in 5 minutes)</span>

I&#x27;m an IT coordinator, currently living and working in Rostock, Germany.
I like good coffee, very complex and very simple music, independent radios, books, art, independent movies and small, playful and heartfelt web stuff.
I started blogging quite recently, and this is my first year participating in Blaugust.
Previously, I participated in the Junited 2024 and July Reply 2024 blogging challenges.
My goals for Blaugust 2024 are not to think too much about writing, to write as much as I can, and to improve my English writing skills.
I’m also excited to see what other participants write throughout the month.
So here we go...
📌 Side note(s): This is a blog post I&#x27;ve written as a part of the Blaugust 2024 blogging challenge.</span>

challenge.
In July I got this wild idea to start some sort of a challenge in August to celebrate my birthday month. I didn’t know what kind of challenge I wanted to do, and was just planning on making it up as I went along. I was leaning towards some sort of casual photo challenge, but one posted here instead of my photoblog. While I was contemplating what to do, I came across Blaugust. I no longer had to make things up as I went along because someone already did it for me.
What and When?
Blaugust is an annual challenge, that happens every August, hosted by Belghast that started in 2013. From what I understand, it started out within the gaming community but has expanded to various different blogging communities throughout the years.
Who?
This year, there are ~74 people (f…</span>

I have a ritual. Every time I set out to do something new, be it a new habit, a new course, or a new adventure in life, I ask myself, why? This exercise in setting a purpose is essential because it stays as a reminder of your initial vision about what you set out to do. So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.
This isn&#x27;t just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world. There was even a time when I wanted to try to write a self help book, to understand the world and life in general, more effectively. I have always been enamoured by great ideas. For it is these great ideas, passed down from generation to generation, which have survived the test of…</span>

Crazy? Maybe.
But that’s how it sometimes is. You can’t always reason your way to the right decision. At least, I can’t. I’d been pondering this for weeks...
It was only when the idea became a reality that I realized it was a bad one. I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.
And when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision. Weeks of theoretical pondering didn’t help at all, while taking concrete action gave me an answer in a few hours.
Detours can be shortcuts, at least sometimes and for me. Sorry for the confusion — and welcome to my world. I hope you have the patience to stick around...</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s this re-explained with a simpler example.
Imagine you have 1,000 votes. You want to show that your political party got 60% of the vote, so, you claim:
My party: 600 votes
Opposition: 300 votes
Other: 100 votes
Presto, we got a good breakdown. The people will buy it....
It makes sense that 600 is exactly 60% of 1,000, because this was an artificial example.
But in the real world, we don&#x27;t get 1,000 votes.
We get 10,058,774 votes. What are the odds that the % of votes you get is a round number like 60%, or 51.2%? They&#x27;re infinitesimally small. You&#x27;re much more likely to get ugly numbers, like 59.941323854% of the vote, unless you choose some artificial percentage and work backward.</span>

                              <span>I built a service around helping podcasters automatically convert their audio podcast into a YouTube channel. I went through tons of review with Google in order to get access to the YouTube API and make sure everything I was doing was in compliance with their terms - literally months of back and forth. I had been testing in my development and staging environments against their API for 6+ months. I launched in production, got a few videos uploaded to YouTube, and they disabled my API key. I spent months emailing them and never got anything more than the same boilerplate copy/pasted answer. I could have pivoted or something, but I just shut it down and moved on.  Lesson learned.</span>

                              <span>&gt;To which I say, are you really going to avoid using a good tool just because it makes you puke? Because looking at it makes your stomach churn? Because it offends every fiber of your being?&quot;
Yes.  A thousand times yes.  Because the biggest advantage of Markdown is that it&#x27;s easy to read, and its second-biggest advantage is that it&#x27;s easy to write.  How easy it is to parse doesn&#x27;t matter.  How easy it is to extend is largely irrelevant.
Markdown may or may not be the best tool for writing a book, but Markdown is the best tool for what it does - quickly writing formatted text in a way that is easy to read even for those who are not well versed in its syntax.
I don&#x27;t want to write a book.  If I did I&#x27;d use LaTeX before RST.  I want something to take notes, make quick documentation and thread comments.</span>

                              <span>Context: I&#x27;ve been a technical writer for ~12 years. I actually started out my career migrating a startup&#x27;s docs from Word to Sphinx. Then I did a lot of time on Google&#x27;s proprietary CMS/platform for developer docs. Then a few years on Eleventy-based sites. For the last two years I&#x27;ve been back on a Sphinx-based site (pigweed.dev). I&#x27;ve also done some odd jobs for readme.com-based startups and have dabbled in Docusaurus, Astro, and Hugo.
reStructuredText (reST) by itself can be pretty rough. reST combined with Sphinx is pretty great. I.e. the strengths of Sphinx far outweigh the weaknesses of reST. For big, professional docs sites (+100 pages, +10 contributors) I have pretty strong opinions that Sphinx is probably the most responsible choice, long-term.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long time Amazonian. The big problem is legacy employees run every part of the company. Almost any manager of managers has been at Amazon a long time, in that same job for a long time. There is no upward mobility at the company, unless you have been in some org 5+ years. In Alexa, the people running the core ML teams have been in Alexa since it started. Most people in decision making positions just got there first (10-15 years ago)
The software engineering paradigms used within the company create brittle rube goldberg machines of events flowing everywhere in the company. Almost all of them are on maintenance mode, where the oncall burns out the engineers and prevents them from creating new products. There is no knowledge sharing between team members. Legacy team members guard their technical platform knowledge to solidify their place on the team.
The engineers themselves are not students of computer science, but just crunch out tickets.
If Amazon wants to change they need to remove a significant amount of tenured employees, and actually promote young engineers into decision making positions.

                              <span>OP and others here are stretching the definition of “memorize” to mean “anything that leads to something being retained in memory.” I reject this idea.
The trauma of burning your hand on a hot pan creates a memory you won’t soon forget, but almost no one would understand it as an act of memorization.
Memorization to me refers to a set of cargo-culty “learning” practices wherein we believe that by using language to drill exposure to an abstract representation of a concept, that somehow we will absorb the concept itself.
We do this mainly because experts suck at empathizing with learners and fail to understand that the symbol has meaning for them but not for the learner.
It’s the difference between drilling vocabulary flashcards and actually reading, listening, or talking to someone.

it blows my mind

                              <span>Some of my favorite views in the city.
The Embarcadero holds a special place in my heart because it&#x27;s the first place I felt most at home in when we first moved into the city. When we moved to California in 2019, I worked in the building right behind Cupid&#x27;s Span. During lunch time, I would walk down Embarcadero, eat lunch at the Ferry Building, or just go to the building&#x27;s rooftop to admire the views of the Bay Bridge.
It can get a little touristy in this area since at the end of the Embarcadero is Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. Most of the time tourists don&#x27;t venture this far up away from Pier 39 (where the seals are), but sometimes they do because of the Ferry Building.
I have walked, biked, scootered, and longboarded up and down this strip, and is truly one of my favorite things to see and do.

Cupid&#x27;s Span - Sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.

Oakland Bay Bridge - the bridge that connects San Francisco &gt; Treasure Island &gt; Oakland. Not to be mistaken for the Golden Gate Bridge.</span>

The original title of this blog post was The end of JulyReply — and this blog. I wrote that I was going to end this blog and continue writing in Swedish elsewhere. Shortly after having published it, I realized it was the wrong decision.

 CGT, Confederación General del Trabajo, is the confederation that represents the majoritarian sector of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism. The railway section of CGT is among the strongest in the confederation, and the 2015 elections, despite a frontal attack against the union aimed at reducing its representation, secured the presence of CGT in the works’ council of both RENFE and ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias, the Spanish railway…</span>

Subtitle: A Review of Cop-Out: The Significance of Aufhebengate

Source: Retrieved on July 29, 2021 from 

 On many levels it seems almost pointless to write yet another text on Aufhebengate, especially a review about a book on the scandal and the controversies and collaboration-sympathizing that occurred in the vain, and inexplicable, attempt to defend John Drury from his own actions. Usually interpersonal issues point more to the poverty of the militancy and viability of certain circles of so-called “radical scenes” than anything of consequence. In these cases I would usually not waste my time writing a critique of a second-rate academic who writes for a gener…</span>

Title: A Catalyst for Fascist Reaction
Date: 7/20/2024
Source: https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/a-catalyst-for-fascist-reaction/

 The fallout from the attempted assassination on United States presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, will bring an increase in fascist propaganda and reactionary attitudes, while also having serious societal repercussions for marginalized groups and political dissidents. While anarchists typically, and rightfully, disparage engagement in electoral politics, the occurrence of this event will likely have effects far beyond just the 2024 United States election. The main focus of this article is to engage with the likely fallout and effects of such an assassination attempt, rather than discuss the actuality of the attempt in a substantive manner.

                              <span>All software is built atop a core set of assumptions. As new code is added and new use-cases emerge, software can become unmoored from those assumptions. When this happens, a fundamental tension arises between revisiting those foundational assumptions—which usually entails a lot of work—or trying to support new behavior atop the existing architecture. The latter […]

Country drives, flea market barn jaunts, dinner with his mom, double dog walks + cuddled-up binging our favorite show.

out-the-car-window farm gem
He took me to see his parent&#x27;s house, where he grew up which he’s called home his entire life.
It&#x27;s strange to witness someone have such an intimate connection to land and environment. The ease and pride as he recounts the tapestry of stories that make up his town. I envy his deep roots.
I&#x27;ve moved so many times that I&#x27;ve lost count of how many addresses I&#x27;ve held.
He said he wanted to share his roots with me. Might have been the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me.

red rubber ball, Courtice, ON
On Sunday, he took me to the Courtice Flea Market, where I found two records that I immediately bought:

Tony Molina, Confront The Truth, 2016. Think: Weezer, The Beatles, with a dash of punk.

Cat Power, Moon Pix, 1998. What a breathtaking cover.

Cassidy Williams&#x27;s post about how hard it is to be paid for creative work filled me with over-brimming madness, frustration, and sadness. How do we change our perceptions of money?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been feeling like myself lately. It’s a similar story to feeling like every day is the same, so I’m not going to go into that again. I’m trying my best to remediate and course correct before it’s too late, but I’m not sure if I’m doing that great of a job.
When I get into this head space, one of the things that helps is working out and running. Runners high and all that. I attempted to wake up 2 hours before my meeting to give myself time to get a workout in but I failed… epically. It’s no surprise because I really am NOT a morning person, so 5am wake up calls are next to impossible.
So maybe I should’ve set a more attainable goal for myself.
It’s still a few hours before noon and I’m already exhausted. The goal is to get a workout in after work instead, or sometime in the evenin…</span>

                              <span>Hard lessons I&#x27;ve learned:
1. It doesn&#x27;t matter what your title is, how much expert education, training, or experience you have, or even what hard lessons that you have learned: you are not an &quot;expert&quot; in an area unless you are invited in as an &quot;expert&quot;.  Put another way, unsolicited advice is unwelcome.
2. Smart people want to solve their own problems.  Don&#x27;t offer solutions.  No one will feel empowered or much of a sense of accomplishment implementing your solution.  Instead tell them the challenges that they will face for various options and let them draw their own conclusions.
3. Your spouse just wants to vent, UNLESS they say &quot;fix it&quot; in which case they want you to fix it, where &quot;fix&quot; means &quot;make it act like I want it to&quot;.  Your spouse does not want to know how it works so that they can fix it themselves next time, and their mental model is wrong and they don&#x27;t care to correct it.  Just listen, figure out what they want and do it yourself, and do it again next time even though it interrupted you and they could have fixed it themself.</span>

                              <span>The rules I have for myself when giving advice are:
1. Unsolicited advice is always criticism.
2. LISTEN TO THEIR ACTUAL PROBLEM ALL THE WAY.
3. Never tell someone what they should do, tell them what you would do in that situation.
4. Remember that the purpose of giving advice is just to illuminate options, not to have someone follow what you recommend to the letter.
5. As the advice giver understand that  you could be the one who is wrong.
It&#x27;s never about trying to convince someone to do what you want, it&#x27;s about showing them an option and letting them decide.</span>

                              <span>Most people don&#x27;t appreciate linear regression. 
1) All common statistical tests are linear models: https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/
2) Linear models are linear in the parameters, not the response! E.g. y &#x3D; a*sin(x)+bx^2 is a linear model.
3) By choosing an appropriate spline basis, many non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response can be modelled by linear models.
4) And if that flexibility isn&#x27;t enough, by virtue of the Taylor Theorem, linear relations are often a good approximation of non-linear ones.</span>

                              <span>I think one of the key points that is often not understood widely is that car-centric infrastructure causes things to be spaced so much farther apart (with unpleasant empty tarmac) than necessary. If every building is surrounded by a border of 15 meters of roads, that significantly expands the distances that a person needs to travel to get anywhere. This further prioritises cars and drives demand and cultural norms.
I don&#x27;t think we should be trying to get away from cars altogether by any means, but I think we should seriously consider banning them almost entirely from city centres. There&#x27;s still a need for emergency vehicles and goods to be transported within the city, so we would still need some roads, but we could eliminate a considerable number of lanes.</span>

                              <span>Had a somewhat similar experience in Houston (minus police), which seems to be a city whose infrastructure is comprised of one 9000-lane monstrosity of a freeway. I was staying in a hotel right across the street from the office I was working in, maybe a 3 minute walk. A coworker offered to give me a ride each morning, and when I mentioned I could just walk they said &#x27;the only pedestrians around here are homeless people&#x27;. So I guess that&#x27;s their general attitude about walking, which might explain the attention from police.</span>

                              <span>I was a college swimmer, qualified for Olympic Trials in 2012 and 2016. There are absolutely slow and fast pools. It basically comes down to two things:
1. The depth - which is only 7ft in Paris, unusually shallow for a competition pool.
2. The sides. Does the water spill over the sides into the gutters, or smash into a wall and bounce back, creating more chop.
A trained eye can see all the swimmers in Paris struggling in their last 10-20 meters (heck, an untrained eye can spot some of these). Bummer that it makes the meet feel slow but at least it generally affects all the swimmers equally</span>

                              <span>While taking a walk near downtown Austin, TX, a police car stopped next to me and the officers started asking weird questions. Including if I know where I am at, where I go, or is there someone who could help me with these apparent struggles in my life.
It took me a couple awkward minutes to realize that I&#x27;m the only one standing on my feet and not sitting in a car wherever I was looking. I apologized (???) and told them I was heading to a museum, bc I&#x27;m a visitor here and that&#x27;s what we do right? I added a colleague&#x27;s address and assured them that I&#x27;m not &quot;confused&quot;, and will take an Uber now.
This was simply unbelievable in my world; for the next week I observed my colleague, whenever they took me out, or went to somewhere: we never walked outside. From the building to the parking lot, from the destination parking lot to the resto and vice versa.
Today, of course, I know that there are walkable cities too, I enjoy walking from my Chicago hotel to the office building :-) every single time I enjoy my US visits, but after a couple weeks I can&#x27;t wait to get back to my 98% car free European life.</span>

A growing number of Australian cafes are offering coffees priced at about three dollars a cup, for a couple of hours daily. This compared to the current average cost of about five dollars.

I&#x27;m kinda new to personal blogging; back in the 2000s I had a tech blog but I wanted everything to index my site. I even submitted my link to a bunch of off brand search engines to get my name out there.
But now there&#x27;s AI bots scraping websites like iFixit literally a million times a day.
I don&#x27;t hate AI. I&#x27;m not an AI doomer. But that&#x27;s fucking silly.
Maybe it&#x27;s just me or maybe Google is terrible these days, but all I could find were blog posts six months old or more that just listed individual scrapers that are probably outdated anyway. So I asked Claude 3.5 to generate me a robots.txt file to block all known AI scrapers and I think it did alright! Here&#x27;s what I got:

I will be going from basic definitions, illustrations, and explanations to the actual code implementation in this series.
Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
In the part 1 of &quot;Tensors from Scratch&quot; we discussed about what tensors actually are how the shape of a tensor can give us important information about the tensor itself. As a recap:
tensor is an umbrella term for &quot;mathematical objects&quot; or &quot;containers&quot; that have a rank/dimensionality associated with them.
Scalars are rank-0 tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors and so on.
One important property of a tensor is its shape. Shape is defined as: the number of elements p…</span>

                              <span>Hi all. Jeremy here -- I created this project. Thank you @bpierre for sharing it!
I wrote my first web app ~30 years ago, and have built some pretty big projects, including founding fastmail (written in Perl) and leading the first major production version of Kaggle (written in C#).
Frankly, I&#x27;ve enjoyed creating web apps less and less over the last few years. So I decided to try to create something that I&#x27;d personally enjoy using. I like coding with Python, it&#x27;s got a great ecosystem, and deployments like Dropbox and Instagram show that it can scale right up.
FastHTML brings together Python, hypermedia based apps with HTMX, the powerful and flexible ASGI/Uvicorn/Starlette trio, a new Python component system called FastTag (FT -- based on many similar projects from the functional programming world), an API design inspired by FastAPI, and a few more bits and pieces into something I&#x27;ve now written around a dozen apps with. I&#x27;m really loving it!
I hope some of you get a chance to try it out -- let me know what you think.</span>

 The Unione Sindacale Italiana was one of the founding members of the International Workers Association in 1922. Refounded in 1977 after Italy’s “Hot Autumn,” they have been the second-largest and most workplace-focused IWA section for a long time after the Spanish CNT.

 Discretely, almost silently, something is happening which will have serious consequences for the future of the international Anarchist movement: the reorganization of anarcho-syndicalism on a global scope, at the initiative of the CNT. Following the agreements of its XI Congress in 2015, the CNT – together with the German FAU and the Italian USI – has organized an international conference of anarcho-syndicalist and revolutionary unions (November 26–27, Bilbao).

From a Matter of Principle to a Matter of Tactics
 Anarchists who want to take action, when confronted with the choice of tactics, often default to large mass actions, like black bloc. Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…</span>

 As we are unfortunately repeatedly confronted with groups that support the Ukrainian side in the war between Russia and the Ukraine from an allegedly “anarchist” position, and as an article appeared in April (When ideology gets in the way of solidarity) in which ABC-Belarus was surprised that we described them as supporters of the war and therefore we did not invite them to the bookfair, here are a few words from us.

                              <span>Today I learned that in Portugal someone flirting is said to be fazendo olhinhos, or literally “making little eyes”. I can’t express how much I love that.
I spent yesterday morning accompanying a close friend from college while he shopped for a 6 monthversary gift. I&#x27;ve met his girlfriend a few times and we get along well, which comes as a small surprise to me because while I am on good terms with the rest of my friends&#x27; partners, I can&#x27;t think of any that I would be friends with in other contexts. (Sorry — I just find it difficult to imagine.)
I like the way her presence brings out a different side of my friend, even though I would be hard pressed to describe the change in words. I hesitate to call it a better side, but I do appreciate her steering our conversations and interactions (unco…</span>

                              <span>Over the past week, I have enjoyed reading various Bear Blog blogs. It&#x27;s really interesting to see different viewpoints, and thoughts that are less filtered, and more raw. It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.
A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?</span>

                              <span>This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To &quot;bear the boredness&quot;. (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X &#x3D; the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!</span>

                              <span>Eriq&#x27;s entry in my guestbook led me to his recent post, Going from spark to a steady fire. He describes how passions often ignite intensely before rapidly fading away.
I completely resonate with this, just as he did after reading my post I wish I was more dedicated:
It&#x27;s ridiculous how well that echoes into what I&#x27;ve written above.
Several others have reached out about the same post. One email started with &quot;Dude, that&#x27;s my life too.&quot; The sender described being incredibly invested in a project one week and wanting to abandon it entirely the next.
I&#x27;ve been on the brink of shutting down this blog multiple times, as recently as yesterday. It&#x27;s hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.
It&#x27;s living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator. I&#x27;m constantly considering pulling the plug. It&#x27;s like a dragonfly that&#x27;s been granted several extra lives, but now feels like its luck is running out. It&#x27;s sneaking around like a cat aware that its nine lives are nearly spent.
It might sound bleak, but it&#x27;s my reality. I doubt it will ever change. Yet, there&#x27;s beauty in it too:
I&#x27;m not alone.
It becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.
We&#x27;re not alone.
Blogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community. Keeping a private diary doesn&#x27;t have the same impact for me.
Blogging is both liberating and inclusive.
I&#x27;m not alone. You&#x27;re not alone.
We have a blogline.</span>

                              <span>Recently, I stumbled across the Blaugust blogging challenge and thought it would be a good idea to participate. So I decided to join in for the first time.
&quot;Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.&quot;
– Belghast, Blaugust 2024 is Coming
I hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...
Wish me luck!</span>

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x &#x3D; 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is &quot;dimensionless&quot; i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.
