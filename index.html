                              <span>Common Crawl is shown in their screen shot of &quot;Providers&quot; along side OpenAI and Antropic. The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it&#x27;s a major source of content for the Wayback machine.
In fact, that&#x27;s the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone&#x27;s site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).
There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don&#x27;t, and that applied whether they are bots or people.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I would have thought about privately disclosing these findings to Dotpe. But all the API requests are right there in plain sight...
There are pretty common ethical standards about disclosing vulnerabilities privately before disclosing them publicly. I don&#x27;t see how the obviousness of the vulnerability changes the situation. By warning the company, you give them the opportunity to remedy the problem before announcing to the world that anyone with a laptop can exploit it. Probably they were just hoping that nobody would notice, which is stupid of course, but now they don&#x27;t have the chance to build up a better wall before the flood of fake orders that could cause real harm to the small businesses whose financial information you disclosed online.
Perhaps I&#x27;m being too optimistic about how the company would respond, but I still think it&#x27;s hard to justify not doing a private disclosure.</span>

                              <span>Emission zone shouldnt be the issue, it is about the amount of cars and road safety for every user. 
Check e.g. the Dutch road design, where many kids ride bikes.
This is already for decades, and has nothing to do with emission zones. 
But another road design can also help reducing emissions. 
It is about how many people can travel safe, and with big cities, you have to reduce cars to increase the amount of people that can travel safe, like bikes, walking, and public transport.
Road and city design is very important for a livable city.</span>

Introductions
Arvind: Hello, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you
like to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with
Kubernetes?
Kensei: Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada
(@sanposhiho), a software engineer at
Tetrate.io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more
than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG-Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of
two SIG subprojects,
kube-scheduler-simulator and
kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.
About SIG Scheduling

                              <span>This impression is staying on my skin like ink stays on the stamp after the paper has already been stamped.
It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.
I’ll give you an example.
This morning, I was just out for a morning run and I turned the corner…</span>

We will explore, how page table is setup in xv6 kernel. How page directory is managed during a fork and exec system call. We will also implement guarding against NULL pointer dereference.
Virtual memory
All memory address, pointers to memory that we are using is an abstraction called virtual memory. As an software engineer, most of us don&#x27;t need to care how memory is given to our programs, or how memory is given to us; thus thanks to virtual memory, we are free from worrying about these issues and can focus on the business logic.
Virtual memory is an abstraction that the OS provides us with efficient, control and flexible memory. Efficient is provided with the help of hardware such as TLBs, page table hardware, etc. Control means that the OS ensures no program…</span>

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it&#x27;s because i need to promote something or i&#x27;m reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don&#x27;t like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn&#x27;t; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed &quot;posting&quot; on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr&#x27;s design the most) so i&#x27;m unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i&#x27;ll ask them. if i&#x27;m gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i&#x27;ll message them instead of posting into the void.
it&#x27;s all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on because you&#x27;re shouting into the void and they&#x27;re not in it, but you don&#x27;t actively talk to them because there&#x27;s this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i&#x27;m pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i&#x27;m looking forward to never thinking about social media again.</span>

Bases also facilitate the proliferation of nuclear weapons, with the United States keeping nuclear bombs in five NATO member countries, and nuclear-capable planes, ships, and missile launchers in many others. Because the U.S. is continually creating plans for military actions around the world, and because the U.S. military always has some troops “on the ready,” the initiation of combat operations is simpler.

Title: Anarchy is Love
Date: Summer 2024
Source: Dope 26

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…</span>

Title: The Making of the Spanish CNT-IWA (2010–2024)
Date: September 21, 2024

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside. This (rather incomplete) article resumes the story of that conflict as seen through the eyes of what is now the CNT (CIT).

                              <span>Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).</span>

They not only make the patients life worse but the doctors and hospitals as well. Dealing with insurance means small practices need a dedicated office staff to file the right paperwork and get paid for each patient visit.</span>

                              <span>Nextcloud is a nightmare.
First if all, it wants to do everything and does none well (or better than specialized apps)
Its internals are a shitshow - a question about getting the real IP of the calling client raised a 10 pages discussion where people said &quot;it works&quot; and other days &quot;it does not&quot;. The &quot;solution&quot; required you to change a volatile setting within the docker container (and do it again when the container changes)
Finally the upgrade is insane. I once tried to upgrade my installation, was told that n+2 upgrades are not possible (fair enough) and ... the installer destroyed the database. What a piece of crap. Thanks god for backups.</span>

It is also eﬃcacious, with policy and real-world impact. It is a complex object, not amenable to deﬁnition by a single criterion. Its dimensions are partly intellectual, in […]</span>

This add-on for the Bearming theme allows you to include buttons for emailing, printing, and sharing your blog posts on social media (see examples at the bottom of this page).
To use the add-on, which requires the latest version of the Bearming theme (1.3), add the code below to the end of your posts. If you prefer to avoid adding it manually each time, paste the code into your post template (Bear dashboard -&gt; Posts -&gt; Edit template).

mail Email
 print Print
 share Share


Then add the following style to your theme:
/* Share buttons */
.share {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
}
.share li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 7px;
  line-height: 41px;
}
.share a {
  padding: 6px 10px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  text-decoration: none;
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
.share a:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.material-icons {
  font-family: &#x27;Material Icons&#x27;;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  vertical-align: text-top;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-feature-settings: &#x27;liga&#x27;;
}

That&#x27;s it! I hope your readers find this feature useful.

                              <span>One of the ways that I&#x27;m fortunate is that I enjoy simple pleasures the most. I have no need for elaborate, constant, and expensive variety to be satisfied. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t enjoy an occasional adventure—I do. It&#x27;s just that I am very happy to have a nice time in my own home, surrounded by the things I&#x27;ve already accumulated that bring me pleasure. It was only as a teenager that I felt that restless call to get out and get away from home to experience something besides the same old, same old.
Granted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I&#x27;ve been to a few really enjoy…</span>

                              <span>There’s nothing wrong with listening to podcasts and audiobooks. There’s a ton of great content out there. The problem is the amount I consume.
Most of what I listen to falls under the productivity/self-improvement category, things you&#x27;d classify as &quot;good content.&quot; And in moderation, it can be helpful. Who doesn’t want to improve their life?
But I suck at moderation. I listen to back-to-back episodes, not giving myself time to process what I&#x27;ve heard. Hours of opinions and advice that rarely result in meaningful life change.
The constant audio stream prevents me from letting my mind wander. My thoughts are crowded out, and my attention is divided, making it difficult to fully engage with the present moment.
This weekend, I put my headphones away. I wanted to see how I felt without the distraction.
At first, it was uncomfortable because I have a habit of always listening to something. But after a few days, I appreciated times of silence. I felt more relaxed.
From now on, I want to be more intentional about how much content I consume. I could limit myself to one episode of a podcast or one chapter of an audiobook.
More doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean better. You can only absorb so much in one day, and at a certain point, there are diminishing returns. Often, a slow and steady approach works best.

Thirty-one countries have either defaulted or have access to external financing suspended due to high debt levels. Even though external debt is crippling economies in the (...)

                              <span>In David Pogue’s book, How to Prepare for Climate Change, he suggests readers consider relocating to what he deems “climate safe-havens,” or fifteen cities that offer protection from the worst of climate disaster. These so-called safe havens spread across the northeastern part of the United States, from Minnesota to New York, and as far south as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the Virginias.  Like the “rust belt,” “bible belt,” or “cornbelt,” these post-industrial cities are being redefined by their legacy infrastructure access to freshwater and moderate weather. 
The designation of climate safe havens offers a little bit of hope alongside the litany of dire studies highlighting the irreversible effects of climate change. Studies like this one from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)tell us that this past May was the hottest May recorded on Earth, marking it the 12th consecutive month of record-breaking heat. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reports that last year brought 28 weather and climate disaster that cost over a billion dollars in damages—yet another record broken.

                              <span>This is so lost in Agile.
Engineers should get the time to “sand” their products, but we just don’t. If QA doesn’t make a ticket for the space between, it’ll never get fixed.
The customer probably notices this kind of a thing but it’s a miracle if the customer bothers to report it, and another miracle if it eventually turns into a ticket, and another miracle if someone prioritises it enough to spend time fixing it.
[In fact most companies have such opaque issue boards that as a customer I get so frustrated when I find a small issue or bug and have to spend like 50 hours back and forth to prove it’s a bug and actually get a ticket put in the tracker.]</span>

                              <span>I think this somewhat misses an important nuance. Japanese PCs had to be different early on because of the complexities of the written language. All of the important characters could be handled in just a few bits (7 or 8) and low resolution in Western markets, with different fonts and character maps dropped in to support a few different alphabets.
But in CJK countries, things were much harder and the entire I/O system had to be significantly more capable than what might pass for usable elsewhere. This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time. A common add-on was ROMs with Kanji (Chinese derived characters) support in the same way a person in the West might buy a …</span>

With AT&amp;T I can go to their website and unlock an old phone in minutes, allowing them to use a no-cost carrier like QLink Wireless. With T-Mobile or Consumer Cellular (or many others) they just give you the finger. The phone could be e-waste for all they care.</span>

One of the things that makes make a great tool is how deceptively simple it is. Yes not using .PHONY can potentially get you in trouble. But for a small project that&#x27;s the sort of trap you&#x27;ll fall into a year later, if at all, and even then you&#x27;ll only be scratching your head for an hour. 99% of the time you don&#x27;t have to care about doing things the proper way. Make lets you just hit the ground running and only imposes as much complexity as you need to keep the thing from falling apart.</span>

I bought a new camera this week. Or, at least, a refurbished one, purchased on impulse as part of a mad scramble to fill my life with things to do that don&#x27;t involve looking at a computer.
This isn&#x27;t my first flirtation with photography. A brief obsession with the fantastic Umurangi Generation pushed me to pick up a cheap Centon df300 a few years back. I love film, I really do; the warm texture of shots, the ritual of getting it developed, the unpredictability of how things will turn out. But between the cost and time it took to see the results and the technical fussiness of keeping a decades-old handheld working, I slowly began to fall off.

i recently started medication for my adhd, despite being diagnosed about four years ago. i&#x27;ve had a longer stint with my ocd medication, venlafaxine, which has markedly improved my experience relating to my obsessive-compulsive behaviors. since being on my ocd medication, i&#x27;ve felt a lot better about not just those behaviors but my emotions as well. it made me want to take the leap into adhd medication, and i&#x27;m grateful to be in a position to get it.
it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to know that for some twenty-plus years i&#x27;ve been struggling with anxiety and depression, treatment wasn&#x27;t working because it wasn&#x27;t treating the underlying cause. i was adamant about not taking a stimulant, and bupropion has been an …</span>

Most foreign debt repayments were suspended after two years of money printing to support tax cuts. The economy contracted 7.8% and the percentage of the population earning less than $3.65 a day doubled to around 25% of the population.

                              <span>i have, by my rough estimate, used over 30 different art programs over the years. i have reliable standbys, of course! but in general, i love experimenting with different tools. what kind of features are available in other art applications? do technical limitations make it more interesting to use, or more frustrating to use? what&#x27;s the UI/UX like? how do the brushes look and feel to use? etc.
out of everything i&#x27;ve used over the years, here&#x27;s my current lineup of preferred art programs.
krita
so, in the past year or so, i switched to Krita as my main &quot;high resolution&quot; drawing program. i used Clip Studio for several years (2016-2023) but ever since i switched to Linux as my main OS, i needed to familiarize myself with something that would run natively.
and... i&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised …</span>

Author note - Most of you guys here are power users, for whom UI is a visual poem that you need or not.
This is not a commercial project, it is not following any business goals.
But this does not mean concessions to quality, it does try to offer minimal resource usage everywhere, easy experience, good UI/UX.
It explains all it does behind the scenes if you enable the developer console.
It can help one learn so at a certain moment one understands and automates with scripts and specs.
But everyone these days is either seen as too smart or too dumb, I don&#x27;t consider users like this. I know everyone started somewhere and a gradual learning experience is the best.
I broke so many radios and toys when I was a kid and I learned so much, by looking at what was is inside.
It is a project done by one dude, after work and when it rains outside (In Belgium it rains a lot).</span>

                              <span>I’m Hursh, cofounder and CTO of The Browser Company (the company that makes Arc). Even though no users were affected and we patched it right away, the hypothetical depth of this vulnerability is unacceptable. We’ve written up some technical details and how we’ll improve in the future (including moving off Firebase and setting up a proper bug bounty program) here: https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response.
I&#x27;m really sorry about this, both the vuln itself and the delayed comms around it, and really appreciate all the feedback here – everything from disappointment to outrage to encouragement. It holds us accountable to do better, and makes sure we prioritize this moving forward. Thank you so much.</span>

                              <span>On September 18, 2024, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) passed a resolution that demanded that Israel immediately withdraw from the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) of East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank. The resolution used strong language, saying that “Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful” and that it is “under an obligation” to end its “unlawful presence” in the OPT “as rapidly as possible.” More

We worked on it from about 2008 till 2013 then basically gave up, as it was too hard to offer a service that customers could really love and trust. (It wasn&#x27;t for nought; the technology we developed was valuable, and the company was able to rebrand and pivot and now does important work for airlines to optimise loads and fares [2], though I left when the rebrand/pivot happened).

It&#x27;s the typical conflation of exactly-once delivery with exactly-once processing, which the author acknowledges and then chooses to ignore because they&#x27;re basically the same for practical purposes, as if this somehow changes the reality of the delivery itself and the restrictions on its guarantees.
Yes, everyone knows you can layer an idempotency mechanism on top of at-least-once delivery to achieve exactly-once processing (so long as you&#x27;re willing to tie up memory/storage for an infinite amount of time). But this does not equate to exactly-once delivery, and you know that.</span>

I showed it to my teacher and asked it if it would be considered cheating to use it on the test, and she said that if I knew the material so well that I could write a program that didn&#x27;t just solve it, but showed the work, then clearly I knew the material so well that I&#x27;d ace the test even without the program, so I could go ahead and use it, just as long as I didn&#x27;t share the program with my friends.
I didn&#x27;t have any friends (This was 1998 where being such a nerd was still looked down on), so it wasn&#x27;t an issue.</span>

                              <span>I have super fond memories of high school math classes. That calculator was my first introduction to programming. I’d take the time to write programs for each unit we covered so that I could just input the variables and quickly solve. I had to understand the concept before I could program it so I didn’t really think it was cheating. I did get nervous when SATs came up because I knew my calcs memory would be cleared. I remember my solution was to painstakingly recreate the memory cleared screen and pulled it up before the proctor came around in hopes that they’d assume they already cleared mine.
My programming didn’t improve much after high school but I’m still kind of proud of my not-totally-cheating cheating.</span>

ABSTRACT
 Systems theory can show us how organizations develop, allowing them to survive changes in their environments. Such analyses also demonstrate why the CNT is passing through such a profound crisis: it is a trade union which is completely excluded from the world of work. The CNT began in a society very different from today. Despite the many significant changes which have occurred since 1910, its organizational structures and ideological assumptions have remained practically unchanged.

 We have allowed the American ruling class[1]to abstract themselves almost entirely from their substantive political positions and practices. So deeply engrossed are we in their branding as products of consumption, in their spectacular representations, that we seem to have no capacity to grapple critically with the situation we find ourselves in. The moment calls for careful reengagement with French philosopher Guy Debord’s book The Society of the Spectacle, as well as one of its most important, if unsung, precursors, German philosopher (perhaps anti-philosopher) …</span>

                              <span>I’m finding myself falling into this habit of reading blog posts that resonate with me, with full intention of writing a response post for it, and never actually doing it.
Half the time, it’s because I answer it in my head, and forget that I didn’t actually answer it out loud (or in this case, via a blog post).
I do this often. Not just for blog posts.
If I’ve ever left you on Read1, it&#x27;s (mostly) not because I am ignoring you. Most of the time, I respond in my head, exit out of the message, and completely forget about it. This can happen for text or email.
It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s me.
Sometimes, I just get really overwhelmed and may take me some time to respond. Again, it&#x27;s me, not you.
Anyways, back to the blog posts.
I&#x27;ve been reading a ton of blog posts that I&#x27;ve wanted to reply to. Or mostly to spin off my own Reply post to it. I think I&#x27;ve only done one response post because I keep forgetting to physically write it down on my to-do list to start.
Essentially this is just a reminder to myself that I&#x27;d still like to do that. And to stop forgetting.
That&#x27;s all. Maybe it can be a reminder for you too.

                              <span>There is an argument to be made about the nature of it—a form of confidence that benefits a community of like-minded individuals, a society, or in this case, a country. While I am no Nietzsche or Kafka, I live in one, like any person in today&#x27;s world—a world undoubtedly centered around a prominent theme: patriotism.
What even is patriotism? The word often carries different meanings depending on who you ask. Some define it as love and loyalty to one&#x27;s country, a commitment to uphold a national belief or the core values they personally hold dear.

Title: What Is A Woman
Subtitle: A Short Gender Egoist Simplification
Date: 17 Sep 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/09/17/what-is-a-woman/

 Any feminine-aligned adult individual who develops self-content within womanhood, female identity/conventions which vary from cultural region to cultural region. 
 Any individual who activates certain — but not strictly all — social aesthetics and conduct in order to be in line with traits conventionally associated with women. 
 Any individual who dissolves the sacredness of taxonomy with her conscious existence as a woman, regardless of essentialist wailing about perceived &quot;Flaws,&quot; &quot;Defects&quot; or &quot;Inauthenticity&quot;. 
 (Cisgender women, that is, women who affirm their having been assigned &quot;Female&quot; at birth and who pursue femininity in agreement with this, experience much of the same hatred and dehumanization that transgender women face each and every day, especially when it comes to reproductive capability, physical appearance, etc. All women, transgender or cisgender, suffer patriarchy in similar but unique circumstances.) 
 A woman is a person who delivers raw self-contents into the versatile bounds that form the living picture of a woman.
 She is her own while engaging the social sensors that call out &quot;Woman!&quot; 
 She is free and she is entire.</span>
