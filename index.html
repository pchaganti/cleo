When Israel sends its military into Gaza and the West Bank, it’s also a defensive move. When the United States occupies countries around the world, sails its warships off the coast of China  More

1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.
About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&#x27;re willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
This becomes particularly problematic when running large-sc…</span>

Eventually I got a letter saying I had to show up and prove I wasnt going to do drugs with it.  So I showed up with my invoice.
Then I was told I had to submit fingerprints and sign a letter promising I wasnt going to do drugs and I refused.
Finally a month later they sent me a letter saying I had forfeited the money and I showed up again (took a day off work) and they said I had to go to court.  So I went to court, and the judge spent ten minutes telling the cops that didnt show up I had to get my money back.
Next month after that I got a call saying I had property to pick up and that I&#x27;d be fined daily if I didnt.  So I got the money back.</span>

                              <span>This is a well-intentioned but largely useless ruling because it fails to define the maximum duration for which property can be held. As such, it&#x27;s up to the police as to what qualifies as indefinite. If the ruling had capped it to 14 or 30 days, that would be a useful ruling.
A hard time cap is essential because one&#x27;s life too has a cap. The amount of time for which one can go without earning a livelihood also has a cap. Imagine if prison sentences didn&#x27;t have a time cap.
This illustrates a common problem with our laws. They&#x27;re very often vaguely defined, needlessly so, in a way that keeps attorneys and judges very rich, and the police abusive, to the detriment of the individual. In a sensible world, the laws would all be rewritten for clarity and consistency, starting with the Constitution.</span>

                              <span>Last week, I “participated” in Silent Sunday partially due to my social battery being drained. I initially thought that Silent Sunday meant posting a photo that conveys silence, tranquility, and the like. Perhaps in some ways, it still can be. However, I’d be remiss not to acknowledge it’s actual origin1 as described by mocha beanie mummy.
Sometimes I find that words can clutter a photograph. Sometimes I want to look at a photograph, and make up my own mind about it, what I think about it, rather than what others might think it should be about.
The rules guidelines are simple:2
Only one photo.
The photo you post must be taken by you.
Photo must be taken the week you post it.
No other words in the post. Title can be: Silent Sunday or date, nothing else.
Of course, like everything out there, people have done their own Silent Sunday renditions. However, from what I see in the Mastodon hashtag, people are mostly keeping to its original concept.

                              <span>There’s a really nice quote that goes along the lines of “we’re a combination of everything we’ve ever known.” We’re just composed of things that we come across in our lives, and I find that very beautiful.
You are a museum.
Some people will stay away because they’re simply not interested.
Some will only explore the first floor because they find the whole thing intimidating.
Some will only visit for the temporary exhibit.
And some will scan all the floors but won’t learn any of the context.
Only few will spend hours reading into the depths of what’s on display.
And those are the ones who will cherish you.
~evie
In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the &quot;artifacts&quot; of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy. …</span>

                              <span>Wow those answers are indeed funny. I agree that as an OSS dev/maintainer, it&#x27;s easy to fall on the vice of over-generalization and crusade for the perfect solution, and it feels that&#x27;s exactly what happened there.
&gt; this feature is algorithmically impossible
&gt; You&#x27;re just looking at one specific video, not the general problem.
&gt; is not generally possible.
As a fellow multimedia dev, man, who cares? Sometimes we forget that software ought to be useful, not hypothetical ideals of truth. Just implement the feature for those codecs that support it and which probably are in the 98% percentile of what users actually use, regardless of the damned &quot;general case&quot;.
Or accept and announce shamelessly that you don&#x27;t have either the knowledge or the development resources to tackle such a complex feature. But excuses about not being possible for absolutely every possible codec in a completely generic way is just denying that the world is just a chaotic and dirty place where things are not ideal nor perfect.

This really rings true. Just think of all the nonsense you have to deal with in the name of &quot;security.&quot; Mandatory password change intervals. Insane rules for constructing passwords. Completely undocumented password requirements that you just have to figure out by trial and error. Complicated error messages full of security jargon. &quot;Secret Questions&quot; that you can&#x27;t remember the answers to. And on the other side of the coin, the security of these systems themselves is like a sieve. So many data breaches, information disclosures, they are in the news almost daily. I often wonder how they get away with it all.</span>

If anyone wants a great introduction to the context and the bigger picture, there&#x27;s this great article from the NYT in 2022, written by an excellent reporter who lives in Brazil. I highly recommend this article to anyone who hasn&#x27;t lived in Brazil for the last 10 years:
&quot;To Defend Democracy, Is Brazil’s Top Court Going Too Far?&quot;
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/americas/bolsonaro-...
https://archive.is/plQFT
It covers the judge at the center of the current issue: &quot;Mr. Moraes has jailed five people without a trial for posts on social media that he said attacked Brazil’s institutions. He has also ordered social networks to remove thousands of posts and videos with little room for appeal. And this year, 10 of the court’s 11 justices sentenced a congressman to nearly nine years in prison for making what they said were threats against them in a livestream.&quot;
Rumble has been blocked in Brazil for over a year, and WhatsApp and Telegram have been briefly blocked multiple times.</span>

                              <span>Stripe, Block, and PayPal each solved a massive pain point.
PayPal provided a way to pay people and vendors without giving away your credit card number.
Square made it easy to accept payment in person on a phone, without an extensive upfront underwriting experience and without expensive fixed monthly fees.
Stripe did the same as Square, but for accepting online payments.
Fraud and Risk come in many forms, and these providers, even with their UX innovations, sit on top of those same rails to reduce fraud.  Without those rails, buyers can’t trust sellers and sellers can’t trust buyers.
In my opinion, you need to find a way to solve that problem before you can eliminate the fees being captured by these providers.</span>

                              <span>🗓️ // August 10 - August 16, 2024
I am enjoying writing these Week Notes on Saturday mornings as I drink my first cup of coffee. Today’s a late start since I’m still slightly under the weather but feeling a tiny bit better.
Took our friend CS down the coast while she was here this past weekend. Every year she visits from the east coast, we take her to a different part of the Bay (Area). Her first year, we explored the city (San Francisco), the second year we went to Point Reyes, and this year we went a little past Half Moon Bay. Pictures slowly incoming in the photo blog.
A co-worker turned friend recently started a blog. I’ve been talking about my blogging experience the past few months, and since she was looking to start something new, figured she’d try her hand in it. She’s currently t…</span>

                              <span>My brother said he thought my blog was broken, so I decided to give it a makeover by creating a new theme. I call it Bearming, because every theme needs a fancy name, right?
Based on the default Bear theme, I aimed to create a clean theme with good readability. The appearance of the list of blog posts is inspired by the beautiful McLuhan theme.
I also wanted to make it easily customizable and expandable. The solution became what I&#x27;ve called &#x27;Add-ons&#x27;. These are optional additions for special tweaks. Currently, there are three, with more to come:
Print styles
Highlighted tab
Upvote button
You can simply delete the ones you don&#x27;t want to use. If you want to use the highlighted tab part, it works best if you only have Home, Blog, and any Page in your navigation. Example code:

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling okay for the most part this month. I&#x27;ve been getting work done, I&#x27;m keeping up my habits, and I&#x27;m exploring my own creativity through writing. So it feels all the more terrible when I&#x27;m suddenly hit with a wave of depression.
For me, these waves come and go at random intervals. I could be having the best day and be hit with the most intense bouts of sadness, anxiety, and hopelessness. It might not be the most healthy thing to do, but I try to distract myself from these feelings by immersing myself in my work, hobbies, or playing video games with friends. This doesn&#x27;t always help, but it does keep my mind off of it, at least for a short time.
It does get overwhelming sometimes dealing with all this by myself. I don&#x27;t really have anyone in my life to speak about these things, so I have elected to scream these thoughts into the void that is my blog. I rarely, if at all, feel comfortable enough to talk about my feelings with friends or family because I was raised in a culture where that was not common or tolerated.
This might all sound hopeless, but I know that this will soon pass and that these feelings are temporary. All I have to do is ride out the waves.

Any rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.

 Fluctuations within a continuum can be generated from diverging narratives. Uncertain climes, alternative timelines. Chronoflipping, retroswitching, taleshifting. An alterverse created via timeforge. Terra incognita.
 Narratives serve the function of temporal modulators, unbound by the shackles of progress and linearity. Vectors of radivergence. Distorting, disrupting, and corrupting conventional chronologies, conduits to alternative realities proliferate with every shift in narrative azimuth. Each story is a potential rupture in the continuum of time, a machinic assemblage capable of bearing a plethora of parallel existences. Through an intricate tango b…</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

                              <span>I read that Cole has been experimenting with blogging from his iPhone. He says:
Using my iPhone to write blog posts feels more casual and personable. It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.
Sounds wonderful!
For me, it’s the opposite. When I write on my phone, I stop and “overthink” things. I lose the flow I crave, just letting the thoughts flow onto the page. That’s why I can’t write in English either. It becomes awkwardly stilted.
I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different ways to write, and I&#x27;ve figured out that writing in Swedish first is the way to go for me. I usually type it up on my computer, using TextEdit in full-screen, and then translate it. After that, I go through the text and edit some parts here and there.
It might sound like a lot of extra work, but I&#x27;ve actually grown to enjoy the process. It’s fun, interesting, and I&#x27;m learning a ton.
Whether we choose to write on a computer, phone, or in a notebook doesn’t matter. The important thing is that we find a setup that suits us. Besides, as Cole mentions, one doesn’t exclude the other.
Changing your method for a period can work wonders if writer’s block comes knocking.
Keep writing!</span>

In the name of “public safety,” Columbia has sought to silence protest and speech be it by suspension, expulsion or arrest.  Utilizing an academic star chamber stoked by outside investigators and inside sham, by pretext and intimidation, it has invented an academic crisis and then marched to punish students and faculty who wish nothing more than to express ideas.    More

It also violated a Navajo law that denied any hauling of radioactive material through the Nation, but Arizona and the feds declared their control over the route. More

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…</span>

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12.

 Until today, we knew that the mechanisms of repression of the state and capital were the army, the police, the schools, the psychiatric hospitals. Now we know that along with them have been added the Greek Cypriot ‘rapprochement’ state intellectuals and social-patriots. How else could we explain the fact that these gentlemen invite representatives from all the supposedly re-reunificationist areas to such a meeting — for represe…</span>

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…</span>

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…</span>

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target. 
 Socialist anarchists, on the other hand, are willing to engage in legitimate work, seeing it …</span>

 “Is it possible to exercise rulership righteously: without killing and without instigating others to kill, without confiscating and without instigating others to confiscate, without sorrowing and without causing sorrow?” 
 -The Buddha, SN 4.20 [1]
Introduction
 Buddhist Anarchism is a synthesis of Anarchism from Buddhist Religion. Buddhism is a religion over 2,500 years old that teaches people to free themselves from Dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness) through practicing Sila, Samadhi and Panya (Virtue, Concentration and Wisdom) and achieving nibbana (enlightenment, freedom from dukkha).

The problem is that government doesn’t have a line, that line is defined by the resistance it faces. Today it might be people sharing MP3s, tomorrow they will come after you for hosting a parody of mickey mouse. 10 years from now they’ll be busting down doors for sharing illegal memes (Seems to already be the case in the UK).
Sitting by passively and praying that the system will come to its senses is a fool’s errand. Copyright holders, the government, and powerful interests are entities that have no problem playing dirty.</span>

I know it&#x27;s not as popular or sexy as it used to be, but the whole point of a foundation like Apache was to avoid these situations, even more than the way the Linux Foundation is setup. Apache _explicitly_ manages projects to avoid these downsides.
- Single corporation ownership. Projects cannot get out of the Incubator unless they demonstrate a diverse and healthy community. That doesn&#x27;t mean popular, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean best-in-class, but it means that there shouldn&#x27;t be just one entity backing a project.
- Membership in Apache is _personal_ not a seat for a given company. If you&#x27;re a committer on an Apache project and you move jobs, you&#x27;re _still_ a committer on that project
- The Foundation owns the trademarks. There have been fights about this in the past, but the whole idea is that the _community_ owns the name, so some corporation can&#x27;t claim to be the sole or official owner by naming their company or product after the open source product.
The core premise of the Apache Software Foundation is community over code, that healthy, diverse communities have a better chance of standing the test of time than open source projects backed by a single individual or company. That&#x27;s the thesis at least.
The is starkly different from several other foundations, notably the Linux Foundation or Eclipse Foundation which are modeled more around industry consortiums.
Both models have their place, but I believe Apache better models the core values many of us feel strongly about when it comes to free and open source software.</span>

Increasingly it seems that &quot;open source&quot; is just the teaser to get people interested and then when investors want revenue growth, the rug gets pulled.

                              <span>I understand the goal, and the perceived abuse of the Core edition. But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it&#x27;s quite expensive, &quot;contact us&quot; salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor.
The Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there&#x27;s was a way to walk back from it. But now there&#x27;s no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition.
I think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes?
I wish them the best, they&#x27;re a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause.
Getting in bed with a single vendor for an incredibly sticky tool comes with a _lot_ of risk. It took at least 17y for Amazon to get rid of its last Oracle database: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-...</span>

In Kubernetes 1.31, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity) gets enabled by default.
MatchLabelKeys - Enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates
During a workload&#x27;s (e.g., Deployment) rolling update, a cluster may have Pods from multiple versions at the same time.
However, the scheduler cannot distinguish between old and new versions based on the LabelSelector specified in PodAffinity or PodAntiAffinity. As a result, it will co-locate or disperse Pods regardless of their versions.
This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcome, for example:
New version Pods are co-located with old version Pods (PodAffinity), which will ev…</span>

                              <span>PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The reclaim policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PVC Bound to a PV.
When the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to be honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.31 release, a beta feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.
How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?
PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is

project has been designed to fulfill microservice architectures in the past,
it’s now time to listen to the end users and introduce features which have a
stronger focus on AI/ML.
One of these requirements is to support Open Container Initiative (OCI)
compatible images and artifacts (referred as OCI objects) directly as a native
volume source. This allows users to focus on OCI standards as well as enables
them to store and distribute any content using OCI registries. A feature like
this gives the Kubernetes project a chance to grow into use cases which go

                              <span>The overthrow of the Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s dictatorial government in Bangladesh by students and the populace last week is a startling outcome of the economic nightmare. The country&#x27;s average GDP growth over the past decade, according to government statistics, was around 6.6%. As late as April this year, the World Bank reckoned that Bangladesh would grow by 5.6% this year, led by its highly successful garment industry, which relies on cheap labour sweat shops to gain market share globally.

                              <span>I haven’t been feeling well the past few days. I have been feverishly urging myself with tasks throughout the day so I can get my mind off things. Better be productive than dwell with my thoughts, right?
This post isn&#x27;t a vent, but a candid depiction of the reality of living with depression. (And sometimes I have this strange notion, that perhaps I am helping someone out there also battling depression.)
Recently, I have been forcing myself to leave the house. Depression tries to trick me, to convince me: What will change if you go out? This happens every time I am stuck in the depression loop (as I like to call it). Out of bitterness, I would challenge myself to step out the house for two minutes, then I am free to hide back inside. But the moment I step out, I immediately feel better, and…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been posting Throwback Thursday posts for the past few weeks on my Photoblog where I highlight some of my photos from the archive. It’s been a lot of fun so I wanted to do something similar today on here.
The Millennial generation is huge on nostalgia. Here are some of the highlights I remember from growing up in the 1990s.
Fashion
Butterfly hair clips.
Gel bracelets, the more the better... mostly in black and red.
Tattoo chokers -- although I think these are making a comeback amongst the Gen Zs?
White eyeliner -- I&#x27;m not sure why I ever thought this looked good on me, but I tried.
Studded belts worn sideways.
Those milky gel pens that we&#x27;d use to draw/write on ourselves. I remember writing I &lt;3 and the initials of that week&#x27;s crush.
Music

I was fairly surprised to have my real life and my IndyWeb life collide like that. Jim and I are about the same age and have had some similar life experiences, facts we know because we&#x27;ve read each other&#x27;s blogs.(Jim&#x27;s Blog) It just felt good to have two parts of my life meet each other like that.
Ten years ago I discovered the community of Apple People who were separate from the company. A lot of them were podcasters like David Sparks and the guys from the Accidental Tech Podcast, John Siracusa, Casey Liss and Marco Arment. There …</span>

                              <span>Volumes in Kubernetes have been described by two attributes: their storage class, and
their capacity. The storage class is an immutable property of the volume, while the
capacity can be changed dynamically with volume
resize.
This complicates vertical scaling of workloads with volumes. While cloud providers and
storage vendors often offer volumes which allow specifying IO quality of service
(Performance) parameters like IOPS or throughput and tuning them as workloads operate,
Kubernetes has no API which allows changing them.
We are pleased to announce that the VolumeAttributesClass
KEP,
alpha since Kubernetes 1.29, will be beta in 1.31. This provides a generic,
Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO.
Like all new volume features in Kubernetes, this API is…</span>

                              <span>Kubernetes is renowned for its robust orchestration of containerized applications,
but as clusters grow, the demands on the control plane can become a bottleneck.
A key challenge has been ensuring strongly consistent reads from the etcd datastore,
requiring resource-intensive quorum reads.
Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a major improvement:
consistent reads from cache, graduating to Beta in Kubernetes v1.31.
Why consistent reads matter
Consistent reads are essential for ensuring that Kubernetes components have an accurate view of the latest cluster state.
Guaranteeing consistent reads is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of Kubernetes operations,
enabling components to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

                              <span>I was once involved in a similar (unintentional) experiment with a multi-billion dollar defence radar.  A several metres deep underground bunker, containing several 19&quot; racks full of electrical/electronic gear, filled to ground level with a combination of mineralised surface water and mud during a storm.
What we wanted to do was cut the power, pump the water out of the bunker ASAP and immediately clean the whole lot with pure water.
What the (arse-covering) site manager did was nothing, not even cut the power, until a &quot;risk-assessment&quot; had been done.  For the first few days we were able to peer into the bunker&#x27;s hatch and watch der blinkenlights happily operating in the gloom underwater.  That stopped after a few days.  About a week later the risk had been assessed and a path of action determined: the power was turned off, the water was pumped out and everything was washed with pure water.  By then electrolysis had dissolved just about every conductor in the system.
Electrical systems will happily cope with water in the short term, but the longer the exposure the less likely they are to survive.  Time is part of the risk.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d echo the sentiment that this is amazing, and that a TV guide would be awesome.
I&#x27;d also suggest maybe adding the channel names (like the comment you posted here) to the app itself (although i think it&#x27;s cool when it&#x27;s unnamed and you get the old-school feeling of channels just being numbers).
Also, I&#x27;d love to have permalinks for the channels. Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you&#x27;re watching right now.
Another thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called &quot;SoundFixer&quot; that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it&#x27;s super distracting), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they&#x27;re embedded. I don&#x27;t know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It&#x27;s probably too niche and hard to do though.
Also I don&#x27;t seem to find any volume control except mute?</span>

That builds in a FOMO trade-off which causes user to automatically/subconciously decide on channel they most want to watch, because they can&#x27;t watch everything.</span>

                              <span>The technology is impressive; achieving such a level requires a lot of efforts in dataset creation, neural architectural costs, and GPU shepherding.
What is the company’s ethical position though? It officially stemmed from Mr Musk’s objection that OpenAI was not open-source, but it too is not open-source. It followed Mr Musk’s letter to stop all AI development on frontier models, but it is a frontier model. It followed complaints that OpenAI trained on tweets, but it also trained on tweets.
Companies like Meta, Mistral, or DeepSeek, address those complaints better, and all now play in the big league.</span>

                              <span>The bug in the legal system is that by filing this motion/claim, Disney can only win.
In the unlikely best case, they get the case dismissed, but even in the most likely case that the motion is denied, they win by wearing down their opponent who has much more limited resources and is personally affected by the case dragging out, i.e. more likely to accept a (lower) settlement than without this tactic. The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs.
Courts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics. If using such a tactic turned the claim from &quot;you killed this person negligently&quot; to &quot;you killed this person negligently, then willfully tried sleazy tricks to create additional suffering for the husband&quot;, and had the potential to double the award, companies would be much less eager to play this game.</span>

                              <span>If the agreement at the time is anything like the current agreement, this is a serious misrepresentation to the court.
The terms do require Disney+ users to &quot;agree to resolve, by binding individual arbitration as provided below, all Disputes&quot; with some IP exceptions.
But &quot;Disputes&quot; is a term of art that &quot;includes any claim, dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or common law, between you and Disney concerning the Disney Products or this Agreement&quot; (emphasis added).
What are the Disney Products? They are &quot;certain websites, software, applications, content, products, and services in any media format or channel.&quot;
I hope the lawyers get sanctioned and disbarred.</span>

                              <span>there&#x27;s lots of discourse on writing in the Bear Den (lol). the purposes of writing, who you should write for, why you should write, etc. All great discussions, and everyone should come to their own conclusions on these things. Once you find something that works, double down! shove!
for me writing is a tool for crystallizing thought. a snapshot of how I would describe a topic in my own words at that point in time. There are 3 ways I see this as useful:
It&#x27;s powerful like how any picture at any point in time is. Like a picture, you can see progress (taking the delta of the snapshot and some future point). Plus, as you continue to write, you have a body of work to point to that monotonically increases1.
Different from pictures, one of the biggest advantages I leverage is the ability to move …</span>

Loren writes:
I prefer reading spontaneous posts that are authentic, not those written solely to meet a daily challenge goal. As a reader, I can easily tell the difference.
Nick agrees, writing:
Right? It&#x27;s a cool idea, just not for me. I&#x27;ve read a ton of solid posts on that feed but I&#x27;m personally not great under pressure. Over the last couple weeks I&#x27;ve posted so many things I end up deleting a couple hours later because they felt rushed.
I appreciate this perspective, but part of me also can’t help feeling slightly defensive, in my own right, for a few reasons.
First, I have a somewhat strange attachment to these challenges, especia…</span>

 Comrades of the &#x27;Weal,

 It will probably be news for you that I have left Sheffield for Liverpool, where I hope to be able to settle down. The fact is, our paper dragged on but badly, we could never pay more than about the half of the cost, and we determined to stop it at least …</span>

Comrade Creaghe is doing some more practical propaganda, by refusing to pay poor rates. He has taken the opportunity to explain his views on the subject, in the Sheffield Independent. His letter is so good and interesting that we reprint the whole of it:
 To the Editor - I have been summoned to the Town Hall, to show cause why I have not paid and refuse to pay poor rate levied on me. My answer is in the first place that I do not wish to do anything that …</span>

Title: Creaghe&#x27;s Speech at the Sheffield Police Court
Date: August 1891
Notes: Original Title: Creaghe, John, &quot;Creaghe’s Speech at the Sheffield Police Court&quot;, in Commonweal, Vol. 7, No. 274, (London, 1891) pp. 85-6

As our readers may be interested in Comrade Creaghe&#x27;s &quot;trial for libel&quot; at Sheffield, we quote his plucky speech in the police court, which we have taken from the report of the Sheffield Evening Telegraph and Star:
 Our Comrade said: “I wish to make a statement about the matter and leave it for you to decide whether you wish to dismiss it here. I think it was absurd that a number of people should have to come together and have to oc…</span>

In yesterday’s post, we proposed a methodology to evaluate the ampleness of reserves in real time based on the slope of the reserve demand curve—the elasticity of the federal (fed) funds rate to reserve shocks. In this post, we propose a suite of complementary indicators of reserve ampleness that, jointly with our elasticity measure, can help policymakers ensure that reserves remain ample as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet.</span>

                              <span>As Kubernetes continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of
container orchestration, the community has decided to move cgroup v1 support
into maintenance mode in v1.31.
This shift aligns with the broader industry&#x27;s move towards cgroup v2, offering
improved functionalities: including scalability and a more consistent interface.
Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let&#x27;s take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for
maintaining system performance and ensuring that…</span>

                              <span>Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the &quot;PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime&quot; feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.

I will admit, I visit the analytics page of my blog at least once a day. Maybe it&#x27;s not the healthiest thing to do, but I do it. I do it because knowing that someone is reading my new post excites me. It makes me feel that there is a point to writing a blog instead of writing to my hard-disk.
I try to make writing a habit, but a huge part of it is you who are reading it. The sense of community is what makes my writing habit the strongest.</span>

                              <span>At least, that’s what I keep telling myself.
Or maybe something along the lines of: Life is too short to force yourself to finish a book you don’t even like.
I’m being a bit dramatic, but the sentiment remains the same. I’ve been in such a reading slump this summer and it&#x27;s taking me forever to finish my current book. I’ve been struggling with finishing Daughter of Fire by Sofia Robleda for my Book club book, and thought it was just me. Our book club met yesterday and it was such a relief to hear that the others struggled as much as me. The only difference is… they finished, and I didn’t. I don’t typically have issues with historical fiction books, but this one is a struggle.
My current predicament: Do I continue reading it or do I start on our next book club pick?
I hate starting things, and not finishing them. I am only 77% through the book so I still have about a quarter of it left (1h10m). My heart is not into this book, the book club discussion already happened (and I was still able to participate)… so is there still a reason to finish it?
My list of Did Not Finish books is growing and it’s making me antsy. Outside of this book, I have the following shelved to one day finish (or maybe not)…
Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert
The Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden
One in a Millennial by Kate Kennedy (audiobook)
Interior Chinatown by Charles Yu
I’m trying to feel less guilty about these unfinished books. There are so many great books out there to spend my time on, and I shouldn’t feel bad putting away a book because I’m not enjoying it.
I just need to convince myself a little harder.

I got paid to promote product and service by writing, and not by placing actual or visual ad on my website/blog. I felt disgusted eventually. I felt like a literary prostitute.I sold by the number of words. Eww! Eek!

                              <span>The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates. To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.</span>

The following is a preliminary draft of the preface to the Turkish edition of my book Post-Anarchism and Psychoanalysis, which will be published in a few months.
 This book is the result of spoken improvisations that occurred during a strange period of wandering. I was removed from my position as Professor and Chair of Sociology at a major Russian university due in part to a renewed military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The consequent wandering extended also to the streets of Tomsk, Sochi, Nur Sultan, Vienna, and Budapest, before arriving for a prolonged residential retreat in Cork, Ireland, under a temporary protection order from the Europe…</span>

My roommate J also goes to the office on Mondays, so when I sleep in we sometimes find ourselves getting ready at the same time, taking turns in the bathroom while flitting around brushing teeth, buttoning shirts, buckling belts, lacing boots.
Every once in a while when we do this we&#x27;ll smile and then laugh. Here we are, friends that first met in science class as scrawny kids someteen years ago, now roommates getting dressed for important-looking jobs we both know are pointless. At first we laugh because it&#x27;s funny seeing each other in collars and slacks, and then we laugh at the absurdity of it all. What else can you really do, if you think about it? 8 AM Monday morning is no time to peer into the abyss.
