                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting on the couch with my laptop on my thighs.
Typing, thinking.
Gilmore Girls is playing in the background.
Thinking a lot about Meaning-Making. &quot;Doing your hearts work&quot;.
Scrolling on YT I see a plethora of vids with titles such as: I quit my job and became a full-time artist. Really? REALLY? I want to gouge my eyes out. I don&#x27;t want to read/see this kind of entrepreneurship-fetish anymore. Strike this from my algorithm.
Did i really spring into existence just to make money?

READING:
A few years ago i started reading Saga, the comic written by  Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by the talented Fiona Staples. Not quite sure why I stopped reading it but decided to pick it up again. I bought the box set Vol 1-9! And it arrived today so i&#x27;m v excited to jump back into this world.

Saga Vol. 1
WATCHING:
Only Murders in the Building. I adore this show and so glad it&#x27;s back on. Can I please live in a fancy building like this and befriend a couple of peculiar yet distinguished fellows, but instead of solving murders, we just make zines and talk books?
WEB HEARTS 🧹 WEB FINDS:
On work and capitalism: how to escape the tyranny of work under capitalism.
MUCH MUSIC Stamps!
Eden Clifton&#x27;s pottery is adorable.
I need this Snoopy sweatshirt in my life. Idk, but lately, I&#x27;ve been nostalgic for cutesy childhood things for comfort.
Been enjoying reading  Morning Music these days. I like their concept of sharing what they&#x27;re listening to over morning coffee.
These tiny handmade dolls by myrtlemakes are so precious! I&#x27;m inspired to make little things like this. New hobby, perhaps?</span>

                              <span>One piece of pop psychology that actually seems to be true is the premise that at any given time we are all doing the best we can. Football coaches and motivational speakers may beg to differ, but they have a vested interest in making people think that they can always just try harder to achieve success by whatever definition is popular that day. I don&#x27;t buy it. I believe that people want to succeed. They want to be good parents, good employees, good spouses. Hell, they just want to be good. In the real world though we are faced with all kinds of mundane challenges, from differing energy levels, differing states of mental clarity and motivational levels that rise and fall on a sea of different inputs.
I&#x27;m not advocating using this sentiment as a cop out for slacking. I&#x27;m advocating it as an…</span>

                              <span>First, you have the Bros. These are the guys aggressively following all the latest frameworks and languages, desperately attempting to look like early adopters. They&#x27;ll take any opportunity to humble brag about their stacks and constantly shill for new bloated, aka bleeding-edge tech tools. We get it, dude; you loaded 20 libraries to build a basic website - very scale of you.
Next up are the Dinosaurs. In stark contrast to the Bros, these folks stubbornly stick to tried and true stacks from their prime days. Any mention of a client-side JavaScript framework sends them into a screeching rage about how robust their preferred stack is. Change is the enemy as far as they&#x27;re concerned.
Last but not least are the Indie Hackers, an eccentric yet growing tribe. While the concept has been a way of life for many before them, they&#x27;ve turned it into a lifestyle brand. You&#x27;ll find them espousing the virtues of $99 app boilerplates, nomad efficiency, and perfecting the &quot;200 lines of code&quot; apps and tools. They basically just suck each other&#x27;s d*cks -- there, I said it.
Caught in the middle are the few remaining sane people who don&#x27;t feel the need to pick extreme sides. But it&#x27;s usually just the Bros and Dinosaurs throwing poop at each other while the Indie Hackers form a culty circle jerk in the corner. Ah, the majesty of tech Twitter.</span>

The youth-led struggle—largely forged on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and WhatsApp by Generation-Z Kenyans—has ignited years of smoldering frustration into fresh demands for accountable governance, dignity, and justice.

                              <span>I run NewsBlur[0] and I’ve been battling this issue of NewsBlur fetching 403s across the web for months now. My users are revolting and asking for refunds. I’ve tried emailing dozens of site owners and publishers and only two of them have done the work of whitelisting their RSS feed. It’s maddening and is having a real negative effect on NewsBlur.
NewsBlur is an open-source RSS news reader (full source available at [1]), something we should all agree is necessary to support the open web! But Cloudflare blocking all of my feed fetchers is bizarre behavior. And we’re on the verified bots list for years, but it hasn’t made a difference.
Let me know what I can do. NewsBlur publishes a list of IPs that it uses for feed fetching that I&#x27;ve shared with Cloudflare but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.
I&#x27;m hoping Cloudflare uses the IP address list that I publish and adds them to their allowlist so NewsBlur can keep fetching (and archiving) millions of feeds.

Rather than what many BigTech companies are currently doing: &quot;Wall Street says we need to &#x27;Use AI Somehow&#x27;. Let&#x27;s invest in AI and Find Things To Do with AI. Later, we&#x27;ll worry about somehow matching these things with user needs.&quot;</span>

                              <span>As central banks shrink their balance sheets to restore price stability and phase out expansionary programs, gauging the ampleness of reserves has become a central topic to policymakers and academics alike. The reason is that the ampleness of reserves informs when to slow and then stop quantitative tightening (QT). The Federal Reserve, for example, implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough such that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in short-term rates. The goal is therefore to implement QT while ensuring that reserves remain sufficiently ample. In this post, we review how to gauge the ampleness of reserves using the new Reserve Demand Elasticity (RDE) measure, which will be published monthly on the public website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a standalone product.</span>

She published her fiction with Changbi and her poetry with Munhakdongne, both of which hoped to host her. Initially, Han Kang, the 53-year-old author of the 2016 Booker Prize-winning The Vegetarian, thought that she would talk to the press. But then, after reflection, she told her father that he should make a statement in her place. “With the war intensifying and people being carried out dead every day,” she told the press through her father, “How can we have a celebration or a press conference?” More

The mahogany plant he planted at Yahala Kele Rubber Estate, later renamed Che Park, in the Moragahahena area of Horana during his visit to Sri Lanka in 1959 has since grown into a towering tree. Che&#x27;s admirers honour his memory by tending to the tree every year.

                              <span>I have a pretty old paperwhite. When it started deleting books i had side-loaded via calibre, I decided to get a kobo. I have a libra color, and I have to say: price notwithstanding, it&#x27;s a great device. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with more recent devices, but compared to my 2nd gen paperwhite, it is _amazing_.
Color is good enough to read comic books on it, the google drive integration means it&#x27;s not too hard to get my CBR/CBZ files on directly. The annotation / notetaking featureas are nice (I haven&#x27;t leaned into them yet, but they work well even on the small screen size), plus all the regular stuff with normal book reading. Also, since it&#x27;s kobo/rakuten, the libby integration is better (search and select library books right from the device).
The actual reading app is maybe 90% as good as reading on the kindle (or a more specialized reader like perfectviewer on android). There&#x27;s some annoyingly fiddly features- font size is kind of weirdly variable, when going through CBR files there&#x27;s no &quot;read next in the folder&quot; gesture nor is there a &quot;this is read/unread&quot; state in the google drive ui, so you always have to remember which book you are finishing when opening the next in the series.
I tried out one of those boox readers with the android apps, which would be even better software-wise, but the boox hardware seems like garbage (for an N&#x3D;1 at least). My display came with several rows of stuck pixels, and apparently it&#x27;s a good thing that I ordered from amazon instead of the boox store, because the reviews indicate getting an RMA from boox directly is a pain.</span>

                              <span>I think the results show that just in general the compute is not used well. That the CPU took 8.4ms and GPU took 3.2ms shows a very small gap. I&#x27;d expect more like 10x - 20x difference here.
I&#x27;d assume that the onnxruntime might be the issue. I think some hardware vendors just release the compute units without shipping proper support yet. Let&#x27;s see how fast that will change.
Also, people often mistake the reason for an NPU is &quot;speed&quot;. That&#x27;s not correct. The whole point of the NPU is rather to focus on low power consumption. To focus on speed you&#x27;d need to get rid of the memory bottleneck. Then you end up designing your own ASIC with it&#x27;s own memory. The NPUs we see in most devices are part of the SoC around the CPU to offload AI computations.
It would be interesting to run this benchmark in a infinite loop for the three devices (CPU, NPU, GPU) and measure power consumption.
I&#x27;d expect the NPU to be lowest and also best in terms of &quot;ops/watt&quot;</span>

                              <span>When I interned at Palantir (summer 2014) their business was mostly in data ingestion, visualization, and correlation.
A typical workflow for a Palantir customer was that Palantir would come in and dump a ton of data out of old crufty databases and into Palantir&#x27;s datastore. Then, they&#x27;d establish connections between that data. This is all sounds kind of hand-wavy, but the gist of it is that a lot of government agencies have data that lives in separate databases and they can&#x27;t easily correlate data between those two databases. Once the data was in Palantir&#x27;s system, they could do queries against all their data, and make connections and correlations that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to find when the data was previously siloed.
One of the sample use cases was identifying people filling prescriptions for schedule II drugs multiple times on the same day, and correlating that with pharmacies run by people connected to known drug traffickers. Previously, this was hard to do because the database of prescription purchases was disconnected from the database of drug convictions.</span>

                              <span>Unsubscribe links are a fantastic regulation, but there is a workaround. I must have received at least a dozen emails from Brown after graduating despite unsubscribing to every email they sent.
The trouble is they&#x27;re endlessly creative about the lists they put you on. I&#x27;d get one email from &quot;Alumni Connections&quot; and then another from &quot;Faculty Spotlight&quot; and then another from &quot;Global Outreach&quot; and then another from &quot;Event Invitations, 2023 series&quot;. I&#x27;m making those names up because I forget exactly what they were called, but you get the idea. I hope this was in violation of the regulation: surely you can&#x27;t invent a new mailing list that didn&#x27;t used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it individually.
They finally stopped after I sent them an angry email.</span>

                              <span>When people try and say that regulating stuff like this is impossible, I often think about how unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are.
There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email (it seems like they’re forced to say “Unsubscribe” and not use weasel words to hide the link) I’m either immediately unsubscribed from the person who sent me the email, or I’m taken to a page which seemingly MUST have a “remove me from all emails” option.
The level of compliance (and they can’t even do malicious compliance!) with this is absurd. If these new rules work anything like that, they’ll be awesome. Clearly regulating behavior like this is indeed possible.</span>

                              <span>Man, I remember when Amazon Prime first started, I signed up for the free trial to get free shipping on something. Of course, I forgot about it and didn’t cancel, but then I got an email from Amazon saying, “hey, you didn’t cancel your prime subscription but you also haven’t used it at all, so we are going to not charge you and cancel it for now. Here is how you easily restart your subscription if you end up needing it”
It was such a wonderful feeling that clearly impacted me so much I remember it some 20 years later. I gained SO MUCH loyalty to Amazon after that, and sure enough, I restarted my prime subscription a bit later when I got a better job and started ordering more stuff.

                              <span>So over on Aura&#x27;s blog, an anonymous asker asks:
Hello! A Youtube video essayist I follow on Bluesky (Big Joel if you know of him) posted this:
“How do you become a person who just really likes doing work? I thought having a very interesting job would do it but this has not paid off as you might expect”
The first two people I thought of who give me the impression they enjoy their jobs are you and Bruno Dias, so I was wondering if you had an answer for this (because I sure don’t!)
I was slightly taken aback by this, as one often is when one sees one&#x27;s name in print unexpectedly, and I had to pick apart a little this idea that I give the impression that I enjoy my job.
I certainly have talked very positively about my work in public; I believe most readers should be familiar with the old (but…</span>

                              <span>It is my belief that we all have something interesting to say. Whether you are an average Joe or a high status individual, your thoughts and opinions matter. If they didn&#x27;t then why do they have the urge to socialize with friends or family? Okay so we chat with the people we love, so what? Why would I need to blog? For those that tell me that their journal is their blog I do not disagree that it isn&#x27;t important. The only difference is that your written word now has an audience. Gasp! Being perceived?! This can be scary to some but let&#x27;s look at the positive aspects of blogging.
First, there are no rules to blogging. Blogs serve different purposes depending on the person. For example, this blog you are reading is a personal blog that doesn&#x27;t have a specific focus or target audience. I just …</span>

                              <span>I used to be obsessed with timelines.
When I was young and naive, I had a list of things I wanted to accomplish by specific points in my life. Some of those goals included:
Five years after earning my degree, I should be making a certain amount of money.
By 25, I should be engaged, and shortly after, should be married.
By a certain age, I should have a specific number of children.
Before that, I should own a particular kind of house in a specific location.
And so on, and so on.
Life is a fickle thing. I was young and didn’t fully grasp that wanting to achieve something by a certain time didn’t guarantee I would actually do it then.
Having a goal was good for me. During those 5 years, I worked really hard to reach a specific point in my career to hit that number. What was not helpful was be…</span>

                              <span>The other day, someone pointed out that I had lost weight.
I said that it&#x27;s a matter of perspective – and I didn&#x27;t mean that I look extra slim from a certain angle.
It&#x27;s true I&#x27;ve lost weight compared to six months ago. However, someone who hasn&#x27;t seen me in two years might say I&#x27;ve gained weight, which is also true from that perspective. The bigger picture, literally.
Opposites, yet both true.
We often overlook this paradox when judging ourselves, don&#x27;t we? We look back six months and see setbacks rather than successes. But if we widen our perspective and look back a couple of years, we&#x27;ll likely discover we&#x27;ve made significant progress.
Every setback holds considerably more successes.
Let&#x27;s not forget that.</span>

 As soon as you got any “bigger” health problem, you’re basically in trouble, not only by the things you’re facing by your condition, but actually the opinion is far harder. Today it is better to be some picture perfect child, young person or adult, as otherwise, you will be looked down upon by others. The silly of it is the fact no one is picture perfect, everyone who seems this way, it is just an act.

 Adults have consistently ignored young opinions and voices forever. It’s taught to us that we should respect our elders, because they’re old, and not speak unless spoken to by an adults. They constantly fail to protect and help us. The history of our world is filled with young people and children being failed by adults and losing their rights. From birth, we’re told that we are inherently inferior. Year after year, young people’s ideas are shot down by older relatives, older siblings, teachers, professors, leaders, bosses, etc. Our ambitious, often progressive, ideals and value…</span>

 The anarchist movement in the United States has had the support of leading libertarian intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky; but it has lacked a figure who could transform its guiding principles into something resembling a political movement. In the autumn of 2011, David Graeber seemed to be the man who could drag anarchism into mainstream politics. 
 Graeber, along with other leading figures in the Occupy movement, coined the term ‘we are the 99 percent’. The catchphrase caught on, and within weeks — with the assistance of social media — Occupy transformed a small group of idealists…</span>

Qalandar Bux Memon: Can you explain why you support horizontal organisation, collective assemblies and a dialogical method for organising for social change as opposed to the vertical left party?
 David Gaeber: I like to make the distinction between forms of organization that could exist outside structures of coercion – that is, in the absence of any ability to call up men armed with weapons to threaten anyone who refuses to go along with a decision – and those which could not.

Editor’s Note: Conservative proponents of the guaranteed income want a lump sum payment (Charles Murray suggests about $11,000 to all adults) to replace existing social welfare programs and downsize American bureaucracy. But some leftists oppose those government welfare agencies, too, London School of Economics professor David Graeber says. The leftist critique of private and public bureaucracies, Graeber explains, is that they “employ thousands of people to make us feel bad about ourselves.” 
 Bureaucrats pushing paper decide what we and our work are worth. But somewhat ironically, Graeber suggests, it’s those bu…</span>

 David Graeber, a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, is a man who wears many hats. He’s an academic, of course — and a respected one at that. But he’s also an author, an activist and political anarchist. But his most unique attribute may be this: He’s an honest-to-God public intellectual in an era when such figures are few and far between. 
 Graeber proved as much with “Debt: The First 5000 Years,” his ambitious tour de force overview of the role debt has played throughout the history of civilization and into the present day. And while it ma…</span>

                              <span>Founder of Gouach, the repairable (and fireproof!) e-bike battery mentioned in the article, happy to answer any question!
- we salvaged 100s of discarded e-bike batteries
- we found that 90% of components were like new
- batteries were thrown away because of the spot-welding and the glue which prevents repairability
- we spent 2 years (and 5 patents) to design a robust, safe, and easy to assemble system that requires nothing but a screwdriver
Our batteries have been in use since 2 years in the streets of France, on micro-mobility e-bikes, in the harshest possible conditions (rain, snow, cold, heat, shocks), and we&#x27;re very happy with their performances!
We&#x27;re now opening it to the general public (for conversion kits, and to replace old batteries that are no longer manufactured)
We plan to open-source at least part of the embedded software, so people can write extensions (to let their battery &quot;talk&quot; with any e-bike system, and share it — using WASM embeddable code — to other people on the web!)
Let&#x27;s fight planned obsolescence!
(and if you&#x27;re looking for a new battery, there&#x27;s 25% off on https://get.gouach.com)</span>

                              <span>Based on the headline I thought that this was an enormous capital commitment for an enormous generating capacity, but the deal is with a company called Kairos that is developing small modular reactors with 75 megawatts of electrical output each [1]. 7 reactors of this type, collectively, would supply 525 megawatts (less than half of a typical new commercial power reactor like the AP1000, HPR1000, EPR, or APR1400).
Kairos is in a pretty early stage. They started building a test reactor this summer, scheduled for completion by 2027:

EDIT: Statement from the official Google announcement linked by xnx below [2]:
Today, we’re building on these efforts by signing the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to be developed by Kairos Power. The initial phase of work is intended to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online quickly and safely by 2030, followed by additional reactor deployments through 2035. Overall, this deal will enable up to 500 MW of new 24/7 carbon-free power to U.S. electricity grids and help more communities benefit from clean and affordable nuclear power.

                              <span>Reading the deployment information, there&#x27;s an interesting tension here with applications that target self-hosting.
Deploying this requires running 5 different open source servers (databases, proxies, etc), and 5 different services that form part of this suite. If I were self-hosting this in a company I now need to be an expert in lots of different systems and potentially how to scale them, back them up, etc. The trade-offs to be made here are very different to when architecting a typical SaaS backend, where this sort of architecture might be fine.
I&#x27;ve been going through this myself with a hobby project. I&#x27;m designing it for self-hosting, and it&#x27;s a radically different way of working to what I&#x27;m used to (operating services just for my company). I&#x27;ve been using SQLite and local disk storage so that there&#x27;s essentially just 2 components to operate and scale – application replicas, and shared disk storage (which is easy to backup too). I&#x27;d rather be using Postgres, I&#x27;d rather be using numerous other services, background queue processors, etc, but each of those components is something that my users would need to understand, and therefore something to be minimised far more strictly than if it were just me/one team.
Huly looks like a great product, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to self-host.</span>

I long for history, literature, philosophy, languages and human psychology constantly. I try to self-study some of this, but university studying takes most of my time and mental capacity. IT just feels like it is not for me. I want to understand our situation as humans on this tiny planet. I feel this void inside of me every day. I feel like this year I will eventually fail my studies due to numerous mental breakdowns. Fuck it, I will be someone else in the end.</span>

                              <span>Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I&#x27;m trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.
If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it&#x27;s the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I&#x27;m trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.
Simon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.
I keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I&#x27;ve received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.
Knowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board. He then wrote each of these messages out by hand (suffering only minor carpel tunnel) on sticky notes which the bear now carries like a human bear directional.

It now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.
These are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they&#x27;ve been listened to and understood. That don&#x27;t cost much money but are priceless at the same time.
I&#x27;m grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you&#x27;re subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.

                              <span>When it comes to having an opinion, every cornerstone of a community becomes a droughtless wellspring. No matter where you go, opposing arguments will follow. That is the nature of opinions—there will always be one slightly different from another. Amazingly, even in areas where opinions shouldn’t take precedence over fact, people will still hold their personal beliefs over them. I think that’s just plain ignorance.
One of these communities is the Land of OPSEC. The world of information security, simply put. An area of knowledge that should, without a doubt, be centered around the obvious fact of the matter. Easily. Want to be secured? Don’t use that—use this. Is this thing compromised? Update to this.
Right? Sort of. The world of digital security is probably one of the most politically mot…</span>

                              <span>Someone gave me an analogy some time ago that made a lot of sense.
If you shine a flashlight through a tree blowing in the wind and vary the brightness to convey information, the signal can get distorted pretty easily.
However, if you have a constant brightness source and vary the color, it’s a lot easier to figure out what the source is trying to convey.</span>

What would be the benefit to updating legacy protocols to just use NL? You save a handful of bits at the expense of a lot of potential bugs. HTTP/1(.1) is mostly replaced by HTTP/2 and later by now anyway.
Sure, it makes sense not to require CRLF with any new protocols, but it doesn&#x27;t seem worth updating legacy things.
&gt; Even if an established protocol (HTTP, SMTP, CSV, FTP) technically requires CRLF as a line ending, do not comply.
I&#x27;m hoping this is satire. Why intentionally introduce potential bugs for the sake of making a point?</span>

                              <span>Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;
The &#x27;chopsticks catch&#x27; was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.
The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn&#x27;t the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.
The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.
The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I&#x27;d guess there are even more &#x27;views&#x27; than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.
I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their &#x27;massive&#x27; Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in &#x27;full reuse&#x27; mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.
Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y&#x27;all did good.</span>

                              <span>First off, the booster was going about 1250 km/h when it started its landing burn, it relied purely on drag to get it slowed down to that speed.
Going by the telemetry of the seconds before the landing burn and noting the speed vs time, it seems drag was around 40 m/s^2 when it was going at around 3000 km/h. Since drag depends on velocity squared though, it had reduced to just above 10 m/s^2 just before the engines lit at 1250 km/h, and so would quickly become negligible once the engines lit.
Going by Wikipedia, the Super Heavy[1] has 3400000 kg of fuel at launch, so 3% of that is about 102000 kg. For the landing burn, it used 13 Raptor v3 engines[2] to scrub speed. Each Raptor flows about 650 kg/s max, so 3% fuel is enough for about 12 seconds for the 13 engines.
The empty mass of the Super Heavy is about 275000 kg, so about 377000 kg before the landing burn with 3% fuel.
Using the sea-level vs vacuum performance of the Raptor v2 engines, one can estimate that each Raptor v3 produces about 2.45 NM of force at sea-level. So 13 of them would produce about 31.85 MN of force.
Using Newton&#x27;s second law, F&#x3D;ma, this gives an initial deceleration of about 84 m/s^2 and about 104 m/s^2 when empty. If we do a rough spreadsheet integration, we get that a burn of roughly 4 seconds is needed to scrub the speed assuming no other forces.
Now, comparing this with reality, the full 13 engines were lit for a little over 5 seconds.
In my simplified calculations I was assuming full throttle the whole way, which obviously isn&#x27;t realistic, and I also assumed 3% fuel. So over all I think that&#x27;s a pretty decent estimation.

records on my walls as art
sometimes it feels like a battle to exist and be who you are.
These days, I feel criminally uncool. I open the Substack app, read a plethora of girlhood essays, and realize they no longer feel relatable.
After watching ​His Three Daughters (a brilliant movie), I thought about my dad and the dynamics within my own family as he was dying. We all grew up with a different dad and experienced a different relationship with him, which seems so bizarre. I also thought about his clothes. Did his wife throw them all out? What about his deathbed pajamas? Are they hanging up at the Goodwill? He&#x27;d probably be very disappointed in me for not having a job right now. He&#x27;d call me lazy.
started watching the new Marilyn Manson doc series. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m so surprised by what was revealed. Disappointed, disgusted, and pissed off to lose yet another musician/actor I like to the pits of shitty behavior.
I wish there were more indie-print literary magazines.
I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of Mina Le vids while eating dinner on my living room coffee table. (My kitchen table is overrun by my unfinished jigsaw puzzle atm)
Life has felt a little shaky lately. I feel like I&#x27;m on the precipice of so much change: moving in with my boyfriend (?), finding/starting a new job, and living out of the city (can I be a country girl?)

Noam Chomsky ranks among the leading intellectual figures of modern times and has changed the way we think about what it means to be human, revolutionising linguistics and establishing it as a modern science. He agreed to discuss just some of his ideas with Radical Anthropology. 
 Noam Chomsky is institute professor and professor of linguistics (emeritus) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. would be a miracle that my granddaughter reflexively identified some elements of the blooming buzzing confusion as language-related and went on to acquire capacities of the kind that you and I are …</span>

 Philosophy is nothing but a landscape of perspectives, worldviews, and paths, some meandering and some straightforward, some solitary and some crisscrossing with the neighboring paths, some long and some short, some trekked in multitude and some in solitude, some forgotten and some revered, some new and some ancient, all to understand and nourish the abilities and needs of self and a myriad of others. Being is becoming, the traveler and the path both change in the journey. Yet, even if the destination is all the same, not all paths are suitable for all.

                              <span>People really like to talk about writing, don&#x27;t they? I don&#x27;t personally mind it, in fact I like writing too, but it feels like every other post that is on the trending tab is about either blogging or writing or Bearblog.
It&#x27;s quite barebones, and I wish it would be simpler to talk to bloggers. Not many blogs have a comments section, and if I want to talk about their post, I may have to email them or go onto a different social media platform to do so. I know I don&#x27;t have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I&#x27;ll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.
Rubidium hasn&#x27;t been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.
Blogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it&#x27;s far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.
It was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it. Fame isn&#x27;t an issue, and I like that.

                              <span>Blog is a text-form media. It is literally just about putting your thoughts out there for a few people to read. On the Bear Blog you are free to write whatever the fuck you want. You can write poetry, write your to-do lists, plan your D&amp;D campaign, anything. Anything you want, including bizarre shit your mind is telling you. It is anonymous if you want to. If you already have a blog tied to your real identity, create another one, just for incoherent rumblings about something that bothers you. Indescribable shit. It can be a sentence long. Even one word. Be yourself. Be a schizo. Be a prophet.</span>

                              <span>Before this blog, I&#x27;d pondered the idea of starting a Patreon or a newsletter of some sort. I liked the idea of doing a semi-regular thought or artdump, and the idea of people wanting to tune into said dumps. But I always hesitated for two reasons.
One was that I didn&#x27;t do anything on a schedule, and if I did do something regularly, I&#x27;d stop as soon as it became a task on my to-do list.1 And two was that I&#x27;ve developed a habit of wanting to escape my audience if I knew it was there – worse if I knew who was in it. The awareness made it difficult for me to write or draw or post freely, always thinking about how it would look and if it was good enough and if the people I knew were watching would be offended.
RSS comes as a relief for the overly self-conscious me. While not knowing who is rea…</span>
