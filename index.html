They discuss the vínculos, the connections, between local Indigenous struggles against displacement, forced migration, and narco-violence and the Palestinian struggle for liberation. The episode is dedicated to Padre Marcelo, who dedicated his life and work to the Indigenous peoples and farmworkers of Chiapas and who also advocated for Palestinian liberation in the months before his assassination in October 2024.

Trade agreements like NAFTA, intended promote economic growth, have inadvertently fueled drug-trafficking across the U.S.-Mexico border, contributing to a crisis of violence that disproportionately impacts marginalized communities—those already vulnerable due to poverty and limited political power.

ICC and the prosecutor are on very solid ground here.
The prosecutor asked opinions from a impartial panel of experts in international law. The panel included people like Theodor Meron (former Legal adviser for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs),  Helene Kennedy, Adrian Fulford.
Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant provided plenty of evidence of the intent. Did they really think that when they talk Hebrew to their audience, rest of the world does not hear them. Case like this would be harder to prosecute without evidence of intent.</span>

                              <span>Why do banks fail? In a new working paper, we study more than 5,000 bank failures in the U.S. from 1865 to the present to understand whether failures are primarily caused by bank runs or by deteriorating solvency. In this first of three posts, we document that failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. Further, we find that problems in failing banks are often the consequence of rapid asset growth in the preceding decade.</span>

His quest for a meaningful life led Vance to be baptized a Catholic in 2019. The sentiments he so eloquently endorsed in 2020 suggested that in politics he would act as a Pope Francis progressive—the very opposite of a sophist acolyte for Donald J. Trump. Instead, we now see a vice-presidential candidate who lives by what Peter Quinn calls the “Wanton Opportunism” of a “Horatio Hillbilly,” Commonweal, September 8).  Equally problematic, Vance is paired with a presidential candidate who, as Alexander Motyl points out (here, October 20) stops at nothing to boost his own power.

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

                              <span>Introduction
Continuation of the snake game series. This one is using C + Raylib and there will be another version with Zig + Raylib. You might wonder why did I wrote multiple versions of this snake games? My gamedev session is usually done in Godot 4, but I have always been curious how it differs when doing gamedev in Raylib.
What&#x27;s Raylib?

Taken from the website: a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools or editors... just coding in pure spartan-programmers way.
Key point: &quot;pure spartan-programmers way&quot;.
Yes compared to using Godot 4, I do feel like a Spartan warrior when using Raylib! Gamedev in Godot is a walk in the park comparatively.
NOTE: you&#x27;ll see a super similar code compared to the ASCII snake code.

My Dad woke up this morning and didn&#x27;t know what day it was. Panicked, he sent a text message to almost everyone in the family asking for help. At this point, that means my siblings and his. We are a close family and several of us sprang into action. His brother-in-law lives a couple of miles away and was the first to arrive. My aunt, a nurse with more than 40 years experience was there within the hour. They got him to the doctor and then the hospital where the doctors are running tests to rule out a stroke. His thinking seems to have cleared up since he sent the original text but he still couldn&#x27;t figure out how to set an alarm on his phone. That kind of thing is starting to happen with more frequency.

But when I wasn&#x27;t busy with that, I was reading about Bluesky.
It&#x27;s everywhere right now - Bearblog, the news, other online spaces talking about the great eXodus. It ranged from singing praises to it just being the new thing or &quot;at least it&#x27;s not X&quot;. I have to say, some things about it are really enticing and cool; aside from it being a new shiny thing to try out, I love the idea of the starter packs, the import tools, the custom domains (and those also serving as a kind of verification system), algorithmic feeds, thread and feed preferences, labeling and more.
But what keeps me critical is wondering if we aren&#x27;t just repeating the cycle?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.
So when those times have occurred I&#x27;ve (we&#x27;ve more accurately) adopted what I refer to the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; response to just about anything non-trivial.  &quot;Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take.&quot;  Then you&#x27;ll get asked to &quot;ballpark it&quot; because that&#x27;s what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done &quot;ahead of time&quot; and look good.
Now, I&#x27;ve had good managers who totally didn&#x27;t need this strategy, and I loved &#x27;em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m the first author of the manuscript, so I thought I could answer some of the questions and clarify some issues (all details are in the manuscript, but who has the time to read it ;)
Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.
Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery&#x27;s (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.
Many authors and wasted public funding:…</span>

                              <span>People here seem to be underestimating the advantages that Google gets just because of Chrome:
- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You&#x27;ll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn&#x27;t an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn&#x27;t ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

Now, Alah suggests that the Palestinians of Gaza have rendered the hierarchy of needs wholly obsolete. More

                              <span>This is going to be sort of a meta post, but I just felt such an  sense of joy after publishing my last post that I felt I had to write more.
I’ve long wanted to have a blog. Practically ever since I learned HTML programming with my dad when I was 10, I’ve wanted to have a web presence of some sort. And so I coded various websites to try to fulfill that desire. I found out about free hosting on GitHub Pages, and set up a static site generator to publish to it. But I never had anything to say, and so never used my shiny new website. Then I learned about Wordpress and paid for hosting so I could set up a pretty slick website with a hip theme.

i stopped using twitter sometime in 2022, before Musk took over. the psychic damage that the wretched bird site was doing to me was unbearable, and it was impacting my physical health in a very tangible way. i couldn&#x27;t do it. if it meant dropping off the surface of the earth to anyone who primarily used twitter, then so be it.
tumblr was also driving me insane, so i hid away on cohost for the entirety of that site&#x27;s lifespan. i&#x27;ve written enough about mourning cohost; so to put it succinctly, it was a website that i really need…</span>

                              <span>I feel like the peak internet for me was some time around 2004. The internet felt balanced, and I was happy with my relationship with it. Sure, I probably spent more time than I should have on the internet, but at least I wasn&#x27;t carrying it around with me. I wasn&#x27;t surfing the web on my bathroom breaks or while standing in line at the grocery store. The internet was a tool, not a conqueror of my attention.
For years, I&#x27;ve talked about wanting to set up a desktop or a designated computer space. Some place where I have go and sit down in order to log on. A place where I&#x27;ll keep my computer off and give myself a few seconds to decide whether looking up an actress in some random sitcom episode is truly worth the effort. I want to add a little friction to my computing and just see how my mental health responds. Will I feel better? Will my attention improve? These are the questions I&#x27;m curious about.
Being that I have a little free time on my hands, I thought now is as good of a time as ever to give this a shot. So, starting tonight at midnight, I&#x27;m disconnecting. For the next week, my MacBook will live on my dining room table. I&#x27;m uninstalling most of the apps that I use on my phone to make it as bare-bones as possible. My iPad will remain on, but with the Wi-Fi turned off. I have a lot of magazines downloaded courtesy of Archive.org and some books I plan to read with my free time.
I wonder how my browsing habits will change if I don&#x27;t have a piece of technology at my fingertips. Will I feel compelled to keep up with as much, or will I just find other mindless activities to fill my time? Heck, I even wonder if I&#x27;ll make it the whole week. But these are the questions I will hopefully have an answer to around this time next week. With that being said, if anyone needs to contact me e-mail is going to be your best bet, because I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll check that, but I&#x27;m probably going to miss a lot elsewhere.

                              <span>Spoiler Alert: I indeed was not patient enough.
For the past few days, I’ve been contemplating abandoning my Moleskine journal for my newly acquired Hobonici notebook1. One main reason is that ever since I started writing with fountain pens, I’ve discovered that the bleed through on my Moleskine is just something I can no longer stand. I’ve been diligently writing with my favorite Kaco pen, but now that my Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen has arrived, I really want to start journaling with it. Being absolutely impatient, and accepting that life is short and I should use a journal that sparks joy2, I made the switch today. I only had 14 pages left, so I don&#x27;t actually feel AS guilty.
I have new notebook anxiety. I love buying journals, and stationery in general, but writing on that first …</span>

In the 1999 movie adaption of Steven King&#x27;s The Green Mile, the guards go into the condemned man&#x27;s cell to ask about the arrangements for his execution. They want to know his last meal request and if he wants a preacher to be with him. Ultimately, they even ask if he wants a chance to escape. The prisoner, named John Coffey, tells them he&#x27;s ready to go, starting his speech with a resigned &quot;I&#x27;m tired boss.&quot; Brother, I can relate.

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.
Hard disagree. If you cant decompose to avoid &quot;wonky parameters&quot; then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.
IME &quot;heavy&quot; function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.</span>

And while I also love this I get the sense that many others here are maybe too young to remember that this kind of open access to data used to exist for lots websites. It inspired companion sites and loads of creativity. I find it tragic really, what the internet has become. I hope federated, and even more-so p2p, protocols take significant foothold on the internet and help revive this spirit of the web. The corpo-web is so fucking boring.</span>

                              <span>For me, it takes a long time to create something like the Bear Micro Blog. An &quot;unnecessarily&quot; long time.
Partly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an amateur. But that&#x27;s not the main reason. Nor is it a matter of perfection.
It&#x27;s because I find it relaxing.
Coding is like meditation for me. A perfect blend of focus and relaxation—a kind of timeless void. I&#x27;m often surprised when I look at the clock and realize how much time has passed.
They say time is money. Considering how rewarding these precious moments are to me, it’s a bargain.</span>

1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.
2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.
So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”</span>

 TO THE HEART OF IT: Gaza has been a free kill zone and a “concentration camp” (to quote Israel’s National Security Director Giora Eiland in 2004), long before October 7. 
 In light of this, the most radical position comes directly from the simplest question: are Palestinians human beings? If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. 
 Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…</span>

                              <span>&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?
All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.</span>

 the world is looking dire right now. it seems like everything is worse than it has ever been, or maybe just like things suddenly flipped back to &quot;bad&quot; after a brief period where it seemed to be getting better. but no matter what happened or how, one thing is clear: the number of socially acceptable targets…</span>

                              <span>Inspired by Sylvia and mgx, I decided to create a Bear Micro Blog, or status log, or shorts page – whatever you want to call it.
It&#x27;s quite a simple solution, using tags and the Bear class_name snippet. Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I&#x27;m planning to create an Apple Shortcut.
I&#x27;ve also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:
RSS Feed for All Content
RSS Feed for Blog Posts
RSS feed for Status Updates
Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.
Wishing you a great weekend!
Update: Here&#x27;s a tutorial.</span>
