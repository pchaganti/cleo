Both governors have, in fact, signed laws prohibiting local governments from requiring employers to implement heat-safety measures for their workers. Not to mention the brazen “quid-pro-quo” meeting Donald Trump had with top oil executives where he demanded a billion-dollar bribe for his election campaign, in return for wiping out Biden-era climate regulations.

                              <span>The Ricoh GRIIIx I reserved at the beginning of May finally came in earlier this month. The camera has a bit of a learning curve that I&#x27;m still getting used to, but am really enjoying the portability of it. Although I&#x27;m used to shooting with a 35mm, I&#x27;m still finding myself having to work around a 40mm. I think at the end of the day, this is still better for me than a 28mm (that the GRIII has) since I prefer tighter frames.

Is it something that happened slowly, over night, I wonder? Is it since the advent of smart phones, or maybe TV even? Or was it always there and I just didn&#x27;t notice it?
Because, I&#x27;m of a mind that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to be constantly doing something, anything, or going somewhere to do something (like sports), whether to participate or watch. I&#x27;m not always in front of a screen, or TV. I have a life outside of smart gadgets that involves me walking around a garden, or sitting in a park staring at, well,…</span>

                              <span>I spent about a year struggling with GJK back in the 1990s.
It&#x27;s useful for collision detection in 3D, and it can also be used as a closest-points algorithm. As a closest-points algorithm, it&#x27;s easy to understand the basics. You have two convex solids. Start with a random point on each, and get the distance between those points. On each solid, try to improve the distance by advancing along each edge from the current point. Pick the new closest point. Repeat.
This stops working when the closest point is no longer a vertex. That&#x27;s when the &quot;simplex&quot; concept is needed. The closest points can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-edge, edge-face (no unique solution) and face-face (no unique solution). The simplex thing is really doing a case analysis of those cases.
Lots of things go wrong in practice. If you are doing a physics engine, objects will often settle into face-face contact. A single-point collision model will then result in vibration or incorrect movement. Also, as positions settle into face-face contact, the GJK algorithm runs into a small difference of large values problem that can result in a complete loss of floating point significance. 
The termination condition can also cause infinite looping.
In theory, this is an elegant solution, but it&#x27;s a difficult numerical analysis problem.
Despite that, it&#x27;s probably the fastest approach to the problem. It&#x27;s O(log N) in normal cases, and O(1) for situations where the positions are closest to the previous positions and you use the last solution as the starting point.
The late Prof. Steven Cameron at Oxford did a lot of work on getting GJK right.
I used GJK in &quot;Falling Bodies&quot;, the first commercial 3D ragdoll system, in the late 1990s.</span>

                              <span>&gt; If a founder cashes out 10% of their position for $500k @ $25M Series A valuation, that de-risks a lot of their personal life. But when the startup ends up selling for $250M, that $500k of &#x27;early&#x27; selling would have been worth $5M (less any dilution between rounds) - hard not to regret the choice in that case even if hedging is going to be the correct choice 99% of the time.
IMHO, it&#x27;s very easy not to regret, with those particular numbers.
I&#x27;d take $500K now plus possibly $45M later -- over $0 now and possibly $50M later.
I&#x27;d take that deal even if &quot;possibly&quot; were &quot;guaranteed&quot;.
(Who might regret that is a founder who was otherwise already wealthy.)</span>

                              <span>I recently left a long career in FANG to roll the dice on an early startup.  I was pretty surprised by the uneven terms between founders and early employees.  From what I could tell the early employees takes more risk than the founders because they don&#x27;t get that magic token dollar turning into their share of the founding equity event and have to pay the fictional valuation of the seed to convert their options. Depending on how hot your startup is that can be a lot of money.
Anyway that ended in tears, but I got what I was looking for from it. A look under the covers of the hot VC backed startup roller coaster.  I may be getting old and cynical, but it looked considerably more exploitative than what I saw at Google.  Obviously depends on the character of the founders and leaders, but the structure seems to be setup for toxicity.</span>

                              <span>I was mentally, physically and emotionally worn out when I left my previous startup after being an early employee. Despite that I really wanted to stay and be part of what my friends and I were building. Had I had the chance to &#x27;de-risk my life&#x27; with some equity to replenish my empty bank account, which was empty from taking an early employee salary, I may have been able to stay but in the end I had to get out.
Getting out for an early employee after funding rounds is expensive because buying options can hit you with massive tax bills on top of the cost of buying the options. Worse, the stats aren&#x27;t great for a chance on return. Your lotto ticket gets expensive and risky as soon as you decide to leave.
Articles like this one hammer home more and more to me how little VCs actually value early employees. Paying out founders to stay is a strategic move. Keeping them is worth it because they are the face of the company and turmoil at that level hurts their payout. Burning out early employees is not a concern because you can just swap them without drama. In fact, with the way options are structured and the &#x27;industry wisdom&#x27; to hold off purchasing, it feels like a strategic move to burn out early employees since many employees that are forced out often can&#x27;t even buy their options. They are left with nothing after all that work and risk. From a purely cynical view this is a great thing for VCs since now the company got all the benefit of an early employee and just lost all the costs.
I don&#x27;t know about the other three points, but I can guarantee you point 1 of &#x27;right sizing perceptions&#x27; is wrong.</span>

                              <span>Secondary at Series A is very rare. Part of the reason more early employees don&#x27;t get included in secondary sales is because of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 14e-2. If you have more than 10 sellers involved, the transaction can be considered a tender offer, which triggers additional regulatory requirements and disclosures.
&gt; As of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking.
Please let us all know how that&#x27;s working out for you in 5-10 years. 4 months in and no stress? Must be easy riding from here!</span>

                              <span>The best startups have a concept which is summed up thusly:
“We all go to the pay window at the same time.”
It’s ok for founders to take a little bit of money off of the table if they extend that to their employees as well. Asymmetry is where things get weird.
I’ve seen many founders who got deep into the fundraising cycles without ever realizing they could take a cent out. VCs will constantly tell you to let it all ride, and sometimes that works out, but for most people, having a little bit of financial security while you’re trying to change the world is necessary.
The best startups figure out how to manage liquidity through financing in a way that aligns incentives, keeps the goalposts at the mission, while allowing their teams to thrive.
It’s about alignment. If everyone is pulling in the same direction you’re going to execute the vision. Whether you win in the startup lottery is up to the threads of fate, but alignment is the straightest path towards a result.</span>

Communique on the arson against the French press agency (Athens, 3/12/2008)
 While the peaceful citizens where enjoying the coffee break of their inexistance in the paved street of Kolonaki, we set ourselves for once again under the “services” of destruction and prepared a new gift out of idyllic ashes. With these, we send our revolutionary greetings to the French comrades that selected to attack the network of the high speed trains, sabotaging the routes of everyday hurry and anxiety, of a determined pre-set life imposed by the bio-authority to its subjects.

Editorial — Post-anarchism Today
 Lewis Call{1}
 Welcome to Post-anarchism Today. This is certainly not USA Today, et ce n’est certainement pas Aujourd’hui en France. Indeed, it is a refreshing antidote to all such discourses of modern state capitalism. During its short but colourful existence, post-anarchism has always been libertarian and socialist in its basic philosophical outlook: that’s the anarchism part. But post-@ has also maintained its independence from modern rationalism and modern concepts of subjectivity: that’s the post- part. As I survey post-anarchism today, I find to my surprise and delight that both parts are stronger than ever. It’s now clear t…</span>

                              <span>The first two days at work have been alright. People have been pretty nice, which is always a good start. Orientation is a little messy though. I started on Monday with maybe twelve or so other new hires, mostly summer interns. The trainings are geared more heavily towards them and less towards us full-timers, which I totally understand, but it has meant that there are empty blocks in my calendar when I have no idea where to go or what to do.
My team&#x27;s pretty small — there are only four or five of us total spread out across the globe — and I&#x27;m the only new hire, so I&#x27;m on my own when the other new hires group up by team and eat lunch together in the cafeteria. I ate lunch alone today, which was somehow more awful than I anticipated. Social anxiety hits me hard at work.

                              <span>I used to LOVE collecting stickers, and in some ways, I still do. Every time I traveled or visited some place, if they had stickers, I would get at least one. They were my souvenirs from all the places I visited, each sticker told some kind of story or memory.
Over the years, I started facing a dilemma that I never truly faced when I was collecting other things like magnets or keychains: where do I put them? The idea of permanence gave me some unneeded anxiety. On one hand, I loved the idea of decorating my laptop with the stickers, but the thought of losing those stickers when my laptop died (because they all inevitable do), made me super sad. This hesitation led to a growing collection of stickers sitting unused, each waiting for that perfect place that never seemed to come.

That’s how it feels reading my RSS feed these days.
Perhaps the biggest mistake I made was adding some aggregator feeds, one that features posts from various uncurated blogs. Which is weird because it didn’t feel that way before, but now.. I’m not quite sure what happened.
When I get lucky, I get to read and discover some nice things happening to a stranger, or perhaps read about their current struggles and dilemma. When I’m not so lucky (which is half the time), I get to read how AI is the next big inevitable shining future, and make a million dollars in a few months with a written ad every three paragraphs.
I guess it’s time to clean up my morning newspaper and manually curate it if I want to read quality human posts from now on. I feel sad for all the new, worthy blogs I won’t get to randomly discover because of this change, but I know I will eventually find my way to it if I’m meant to encounter it.
Life has always been that way, and I know it always will.</span>

                              <span>If I have learnt one thing working in software engineering, specifically on AI-enabled products empowering junior engineers, and using Copilot professionally, it’s that you need even more experience to detect the subtleties in the lack of the models understanding of your domain, your specific intent. If you don’t know exactly what you’re after, and use the LLM as a sparring partner to bounce your ideas off, you’re in for a lot of pain.
Depending on the way you phrase questions, ChatGPT will gleefully suggest you a wrong approach, just because it’s so intent on satisfying your whim instead of saying No when it would be appropriate.
And in addition to that, you don’t learn by figuring out a new concept. If you already have a feeling of the code you would write anyway, and only treat the model as a smart autocomplete, that doesn’t matter. But for an apprentice, or a layperson, that will keep code as scary and unpredictable as before. I don’t think that should be the answer.</span>

                              <span>For those of you who are inclined to say &quot;HackerNews doesn&#x27;t deal with politics&quot;, I hope that Lynn&#x27;s story reminds you that any work you do is intertwined with politics. While I appreciate that it&#x27;s a difficult line to walk, to have productive and relevant political discussion in a forum like this, politics and social acceptance are a part of every aspect of our lives. Brilliant, kind, impactful people are kept from leading the life they want to lead every day because of societal intolerance for who they are. Incredible people like Lynn who have overcome that intolerance to lead a remarkable life should remind everyone of the suffering that others go through. There are uncountable other people who are not allowed to be themselves and who are suffocated in our society, with the lives of transgender people often ending in ostracisation or murder. One of the remarkable things about technology is that it enables trodden people to escape this tyranny to an extent once impossible. It enables marginalized people to be themselves in our world.  Let us continue to enable that.
Such &quot;political&quot; discussions and the impact technology has on them are an important part of the discourse here. I&#x27;m sad she is gone but I&#x27;m glad to see that this post is high up the front page. If you&#x27;re inclined to denigrate transgender people, I encourage you to consider that they are trying to lead an honest life. I encourage you to consider what you&#x27;re taking away from them and from the world by dehumanizing them. No matter why they are who they are.</span>

                              <span>Lynn Conway co-wrote &quot;the book&quot; on VLSI design, &quot;Introduction to VLSI Systems&quot;, created and taught this historic VLSI Design Course in 1978, which was the first time students designed and fabricated their own integrated circuits, including James Clark (SGI) who made the Geometry Engine, and Guy L Steel (MIT) who made the Scheme Microprocessor.
She invented superscalar architecture at IBM, just to be fired in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition, then 52 years later IBM formally apologized to her in 2020. She successfully rebooted her life, invented and taught VLSI design to industry pioneers who founded many successful companies based on the design methodology she invented, wrote the book on, and personally taught to them, and then she became a trans activist who helped many people transition, find each other, and avoid suicide, fight abuse and bigotry, and find acceptance, by telling her story and building an online community.

                              <span>On one hand, it&#x27;s unfair that a country already very rich with natural resources discovers more of them.
On the other hand, if there is a country which can be trusted to exploit natural resources in a way that benefits the whole country and its population, and not fall down the resource curse[1], it&#x27;s Norway.

                              <span>Slop seems like a good term for unwanted AI generated content.
But I wonder how much this is AI and how much we&#x27;ve sort of curated a slop pattern even before AI:
- Video game tips web pages with massive chunks of text / ads before you get to the inevitable answer of &quot;hit A when X happens&quot;.
- The horrendous mess that Quora became with technically correct in some ways but also misleading answers to historical content.
- Medium articles about coding that are filled with irrelevant pics and blocks of text that are &quot;not wrong&quot; but also &quot;not right&quot; followed by weirdly specific code...
We had all that before AI.</span>

I&#x27;ve seen him going for 2 hours with some nobody with 5K followers, being asked juvenile and stupid questions and answering with the patient of a Saint. He looked quite diminished physically, elderly and frail but mentally he&#x27;s always sharp and his recall and memory is scary.
I feel that in his later years he made a conscious effort to talk to young people and made them aware of the history and depth of the problems the world is facing, and he used very modern avenues to do so, like podcast interviews. I will always have the highest degree of respect for this man and an admiration for his integrity, sensitivity and scholarship.</span>

                              <span>IMHO &quot;every day&quot; is far too frequent, and this ADHD-ish attitude is one of the reasons why the quality of average software has gone down the drain. Developers need to step back, think more deeply, and not worry about being pressured into &quot;shipping code&quot; that barely works.
The dopamine rush of your code being shipped
This frequent overstimulation leads to less ability for long-term attention. When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.
Your team (and manager) sees you&#x27;re working
Tough problems need time to solve, and you won&#x27;t see much meanwhile. If needing to put on a show for others is more important than actually working, something is very wrong.
Your git commit streak looks good
Yes, people say this doesn&#x27;t matter. But I&#x27;m sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn&#x27;t a great look.
Optimising for metrics never works for those who can see through the illusion, and that&#x27;s an increasing number of people over time. If I was a recruiter and saw that sort of activity, I wouldn&#x27;t think of it as more than someone just putting on a show --- especially if the majority of those commits are effectively &quot;thrashing&quot; or &quot;churning&quot;.
The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done
I can personally say that the satisfaction is far bigger the longer you&#x27;ve persevered.</span>

The way they wrote about &quot;adaptors&quot; can make it seem like it&#x27;s something novel, but it&#x27;s actually just re-iterating vanilla LoRA. It was enough to convince one of the top-voted HackerNews comments that this was a &quot;huge development&quot;.
Benchmarks are nice though.</span>

                              <span>The design of the physical environment is in no small part responsible for this. Don&#x27;t believe me go to Europe and Japan where kids are still allowed to walk and bike to school, to friends places and just in general play and exist outside unattended to a much higher degree than in the US. Because in the US they would be roadkill, and even if they somehow survived outside of a car, car centric design means there&#x27;s nowhere for them to go on foot or by bike anyway. Everything is too far.</span>

I think this is exactly what _most_ people want.
With password management specifically, Apple has had a Chrome extension available for a while now which has allowed me to use it on other browsers/platforms. Not ideal, but good enough for most.
On top of that, they don&#x27;t lock you in with passwords. You can easily import and export your passwords, just like you can with 1Password.
Apple Music has had a web client for a long time. iTunes has been on Windows for 20+ years and Apple Music was supported via that until recently when they built an Apple Music specific app.</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s big problem: it&#x27;s not a replacement for so many alternatives because it isn&#x27;t supported on all platforms.
Safari? Not on Windows.
Apple Music? This actually has a Windows client. I&#x27;m not sure how good it is. But Spotify supports Windows and even Linux.
Apple Password Manager? Will this be tied to iCloud? Will I be able to use it on Android? If I no longer have an iPhone will it be a pain to maintain and use?
A dog cannot serve two masters. A company like Apple doesn&#x27;t see any of these things as a product. They&#x27;re a means to an end: to push the iPhone platform (and hardware sales). That priority will always trump the interests of a product like this.
It&#x27;s also why I refuse to buy more into Google products: it&#x27;s too much of a risk to lose access to everything if Google wakes up one day and decides to suspend your account with no recourse other than making enough of a stink on social media such that an employee will actually look into it.

It&#x27;s the benefit of how Apple does product ownership. In contrast to Google and Microsoft.
I hadn&#x27;t considered it, but AI convergence is going to lay bare organizational deficiencies in a way previous revolutions didn&#x27;t.
Nobody wants a GenAI feature that works in Gmail, a different one that works in Messages, etc. -- they want a platform capability that works anywhere they use text.
I&#x27;m not sure either Google or Microsoft are organizationally-capable of delivering that, at this point.</span>

                              <span>IMO this really feels like the Facebook / Twitter integration from early iOS. That only lasted a few years.
Apple clearly thinks it needs a dedicated LLM service atm. But still thinks it is only supplemental as they handle a bunch of the core stuff without it. And require explicit user consent to use OpenAI. And Apple clearly views it as a partial commodity since they even said they plan to add others.
Tough to bet against OpenAI right now...but this deal does not feel like a 10 year deal...</span>

                              <span>Have to say, I was thoroughly  impressed by what Apple showed today with all this Personal AI stuff. And it proves that the real power of consumer AI will be in the hands of the platform owners where you have most of your digital life in already (Apple or Google for messaging, mail, photos, apps; Microsoft for work and/or life).
The way Siri can now perform actions based on context from emails and messages like setting calendar and reservations or asking about someone’s flight is so useful (can’t tell you how many times my brother didn’t bother to check the flight code I sent him via message when he asks me when I’m landing for pickup!).
I always saw this level of personal intelligence to come about at some point, but I didn’t expect Apple to hit it out of the park so strongly. Benefit of drawing people into their ecosystem.
Nevermind all the thought put into private cloud, integration with ChatGPT, the image generation playground, and Genmoji.  I can genuinely see all this being useful for “the rest of us,” to quote Craig. As someone who’s taken a pessimistic view of Apple software innovation the last several years, I’m amazed.
One caveat: the image generation of real people was super uncanny and made me uncomfortable. I would not be happy to receive one of those cold and impersonal, low-effort images as a birthday wish.</span>

My retreat from social media was gradual and uneventful. I left Facebook so long ago that I barely remember what I used it for. I left Instagram well before it became the weird jumble of videos, shorts and occasionally photos it is today. People trying to be brands, brands posing as people. Twitter broke my heart - it connected me to many cool people, helped me find an audience as a musician, and led to lifelong friendships. And then it all went to shit - though honestly, it had been going to shit for a while.
It was a clean break. For the most part, I haven’t missed social media. I’ve kept in touch with friends in other ways, from the ubiquitous…</span>

Why?, I hear you not ask, well I never felt comfortable with the name, the platform, you name it. All I wanted to do was write but I found myself instead worrying about being judged, rejected, subscriber numbers, aesthetics, and the time it took to load a page on Wordpress.
shudders
I began, like most of us, on Wordpress. After growing disillusioned with it and the years it took to rectify margins, I transitioned to Medium. Medium promised me the world, money and followers. It encouraged me to write often and with hooks. It spat out posts by writers claiming they made their first million on Medium.
It was the worst writing of my life.

What are the governing laws?  How have the international legal institutions addressed complicity in other cases of genocide?  Could the complicity provisions apply to the United States and its leaders  for assisting Israel in a war on Gaza that has cost so many thousands of civilian lives?

It is a tool that has its origins in colonialism and advantages corporate power over democracy. The technical term for such a tool is “Investor-state dispute settlement” or ISDS. And while it sounds boring and technical, it is crucial that we familiarize ourselves with it in order to dismantle it. More

 Comrades!
Today I’m in high spirits (you know our life is not a straight line, nor constant, or static…), and those who know me personally know that I have a pretty black a sense of humour (what ‘scandalizes’ others makes me smile, etc.) almost cynically (especially when it comes to talking about/describing facts to do with the ‘Law’, ‘Rights’, the ‘Authorities’, etc.); because these are ‘things’ that I can’t take seriously (even though my life is wrapped up in all tha…</span>

 ‘Anarchist prisoners are not alone’ and ‘if they touch one, they touch all’ are slogans that lived once again in the everyday anarchist action before, during and after the trial against us. The screams of disgust for authority that pierced the police control and the walls around those on trial clearly enraged the judge and magistrates, as was evident on their faces and which put smiles on ours. The presence in court of dear ones known and unknown filled us with pride and joy, preventing the prosecutors’ accusations and demands from having any possibility of intimidating us. T…</span>

(Italy, Mexico, Greece)
 On Wednesday, June 13th, the international anti-anarchist campaign under the name ‘operation boldness’ was set up. The Italian antiterrorism forces of ROS and carabiniers were put under the command of the Inquisitor-prosecutor of Perugia Manuela Comodi, and proceeded to arrest eight anarchist comrades. In parallel, investigations are conducted against other comrades as well (among them are the comrades of Edizioni Cerbero).

We are not usually “bothered” by the panic-ridden scenaria of the media, yet the importance of the event forces us to take a public position directly, without a connection to any attack of ours.

 This statement is made to clarify and publicly state our position in relation to our recent attempted escape from prison. 
 The fact that we are captives in the prison cells of democracy does not mean that we accept for a moment our position either as prisoners or as defendants before the civil court-martial that you have set up against us. There will never be either a prison guard to lock up our soul or a judge to rule on our values. We are eternal enemies of law and order and eternal prison breakers.

 It was the dawn of May 22, 2009, when an explosion in Santiago, Chile caused fragments which crossed endless kilometers and borders until they brought us the news that were nailed in our hearts. 
 It was the dawn of May 22, 2009 when our brother and comrade Mauricio Morales, consistent fighter of the anarchist insurrection, put his conspiratorial plan in place, heading to the school of prison guards in Santiago in order to blow it up.

I The choice of claiming responsibility and not capitulation
 We as Conspiracy of Cells of Fire-imprisoned members, chose and claimed responsibility from inside the prison for our participation in our project. The responsibility claim is the least way to defend and honour the most beautiful acts that we share. Not as a memory that fades away after our arrests but as a living reality and prospect of carrying on our actions in the continuous present, the here and now.

It is sometimes useful to keep a distance from events before you talk about them. Anticipation and the frozen time of captivity in prison accelerate, nevertheless, the cool-headed distance from events. A self-possessed distance gives you the opportunity to observe details which are usually ignored and bulldozed by the warm blood conditions’ momentum of intensity. So, as they often say, “the devil is hidden in the details”…

 It’s been already 25 days that the mother of Christos and Gerasimos Tsakalos and the girlfriend of the second one are locked up in the cells of democracy. 
 We have already been for 25 days on hunger strike until death, demanding their immediate release. 
 It’s been 25 days and already eight of us are in hospitals with their health condition on the limits. 
 25 days are not just a number on a calendar, it is the experiment of evolution of repression, with new methods of emotional blackmail against imprisoned anarchist urban guerrillas.

 In the incidents of the 5th May concerning the fire in the Marfin Bank there were three dead bank employees and thousands of “charred” truths. The suffocating atmosphere of the heartbreaking hypocrisy of propaganda and the worn moralistic humanism of the radical movement’s Cassandras, force us to take a public stand concerning these events. This does not mean that we are talking as “specialists” of violence, or that we are “self-appointed” prosecutors or defenders of the people who attacked the bank building. But we find it necessary that some things …</span>

 A huge storm of revolt raged through the streets of Greece in December 2008. After the young Andreas Grigoropoulos was murdered by a cop, riots spread throughout the whole country for several weeks. Hundreds of banks, shops, car dealers, offices,… were attacked, plundered and put on fire. Although it were anarchists and anti-authoritarians who took the lead in this storm during the first week after the murder, it spread itself fast and many people got involved in this revolt against miserable living conditions, against the…</span>

1. Solidarity is our weapon
 Many things have been written and said about solidarity. Usually when there have been so many discussions and so many texts have circulated on a matter, it ends up trite, predictable and without any particular interest. It seems as if its content has run out and it’s constantly being repeated.

That last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom&#x27;s framed this new career shift of mine.
A large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn&#x27;t want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why&#x27;s she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I&#x27;m not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?
In Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that &quot;looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.&quot; I&#x27;ve been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I&#x27;m not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I&#x27;m nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I&#x27;m doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.</span>

                              <span>I have been preparing for job interviews (looking to get into genai+backend roles you know). I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…</span>

                              <span>Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I&#x27;m not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there&#x27;s just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It&#x27;s an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

You made it through the day. I&#x27;m proud of you. Seriously, I&#x27;m so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look forward to anything when you&#x27;re feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you&#x27;ll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll feel better. Someday I&#x27;ll be alright.&quot; Remember, that &quot;someday&quot; comes one day at a time, and you&#x27;ll get there. You will.
I&#x27;m proud of you. I&#x27;m very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

                              <span>At 6:41 p. m. on Thursday, May 30, at the age of 94, our beloved Nora Cortiñas left us; we will miss her so much. Barely a few seconds after this sad news, which we didn&#x27;t want to hear, was announced, someone had already shouted “ETERNAL Norita!” at this iconic Plaza de Mayo location.

                              <span>I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It&#x27;s so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels &quot;less serious&quot;.
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don&#x27;t worry so much about what people think of me. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I&#x27;ve come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can&#x27;t please them all – and that&#x27;s fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It&#x27;s more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

                              <span>Since the launch of ChatGPT back in 2022 AI has explod — just kidding. Those lead-ins are getting tiring, right?
But what has become even more irritating is how everything is &quot;AI-powered&quot; all of a sudden.
Let me make it clear up-front that I am not opposed to using AI, whatever that means anymore, for a product. I&#x27;ve done it myself and it&#x27;s a good way to add value to the product, if it really needs it.
But what truly irks me are the common-day apps which have been just fine without such AI plug-ins and, all of a sudden, they become &quot;AI-powered&quot;. Here are a few things that go through my head when &quot;AI-powered&quot; is advertised up-front:
How reliable are the outputs / are hallucinations present?
Where does my data go? (Probably OpenAI, but not 100% sure)
Is the AI-powered going to be a mark-up?
