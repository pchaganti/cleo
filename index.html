                              <span>It seems very odd that the article seems to be measuring the information content of specific tasks that the brain is doing or specific objects that it is perceiving. But the brain is a general-purpose computer, not a speed-card computer, or English text computer, or binary digit computer, or Rubik&#x27;s cube computer.
When you look at a Rubik&#x27;s cube, you don&#x27;t just pick out specific positions of colored squares relative to each other. You also pick up the fact that it&#x27;s a Rubik&#x27;s cube and not a bird or a series of binary digits or English text. If an orange cat lunged at your Rubik&#x27;s cube while you were studying it, you wouldn&#x27;t process it as &quot;face 3 has 4 red squares on the first row, then an orange diagonal with sharp claws&quot;, you&#x27;d process it as &quot;fast moving sharp clawed orange cat attacking cube&quot;. Which implies that every time you loom at the cube you also notice that it&#x27;s still a cube and not any of the millions of other objects you can recognize, adding many more bits of information.
Similarly, when you&#x27;re typing English text, you&#x27;re not just encoding information from your brain into English text, you&#x27;re also deciding that this is the most relevant activity to keep doing at the moment, instead of doing math or going out for a walk. Not to mention the precise mechanical control of your muscles to achieve the requisite movements, which we&#x27;re having significant trouble programming into a robot.</span>

                              <span>&gt; While we gained some traction with some startups, we ultimately weren&#x27;t able to build a hyper-growth business.
&gt;&quot;We then decided to pivot into a vertical B2B SaaS AI product because we felt we could use the breakthroughs in Gen AI to solve previously unsolvable problems, but after going through user interviews and the sales cycle for many different ideas, we haven&#x27;t been able to find enough traction to make us believe that we were on the right track to build a huge business.&quot;
How many wonderful niche products would be around if their owners had tried for a small business instead of a &#x27;huge business&#x27; with &#x27;hyper growth&#x27;?</span>

                              <span>This shouldn&#x27;t be controversial. FTC isn&#x27;t banning these fees, it is only requiring merchants to disclose the fees. Why would anyone be against that?
Another good rule is click-to-cancel. Just a couple of days ago I logged into my Dish Network account to cancel it (after they hiked prices). There is no way to cancel online. There is no way to cancel via chat. You have to call. As soon as you call you&#x27;re told the wait time is over 45 minutes. There is no call back option. Why should a consumer have to be on the phone for 45 minutes to cancel? (Typically they will drop the call after 45 minutes and you have to call again.) If you call Dish to sign up service the wait time is 0 minutes: they answer immediately. If you then tell that you&#x27;re actually calling to cancel, they forward you to the cancellation number with the wait. This is an abusive business practice, and banning it should not be controversial.</span>

                              <span>This is wonderful!!!  Generalizing here but we really do take the moon for granted.
I bought a &#x27;big ass telescope&#x27; a few years ago in an effort to bootstrap a hobby that I&#x27;d flirted with for decades but never really committed to.  It&#x27;s a Celestron 11&quot; SCT and I really had no idea what I was getting into.  When I think of space I think of things that are really small in the night sky, planets, galaxies, nebula...(turns out most of them aren&#x27;t *that* small and I overshot the targets I had in mind)
I kept trying to photo galaxies and star clusters and all of these exotic things but had a bunch of trouble with tracking with long exposures.  Out of frustration I ended up just pointing it at the boring ol&#x27; moon to at least get used to the equipment and workflows.
I fell in love with Luna.
The magnification of this scope really allowed me to explore the surface in a way I never had before.  I got to know the &#x27;map&#x27; and suddenly related to our celestial neighbor in a whole new way.  It was also the very first image I was actually not embarrassed to share - https://imgur.com/a/t9b1Uug
I since then improved my knowledge and technical skill but the month of the moon at the end of 2021 was really pretty spectacular for me.</span>

                              <span>Passkeys are a terrible idea. They are security theater and a disaster for users waiting to happen.
Imagine you&#x27;re on vacation and have lost your phone. You want to go to a cafe and log into a chat app, an email service, whatever to contact your family. In the world that passkey advocates want this is impossible via the passkey flow. If you can&#x27;t authenticate via a primary device that contains your private key, you&#x27;re f-ed. Service providers know this so of course they will provide recovery mechanisms. (Not consistent recovery mechanisms of course, each will have their own convoluted and likely to be broken ones). If the recovery mechanism allows for knowledge based recovery (challenge questions) then you&#x27;re basically telling people that they need N passwords rather than one password. Maybe that challenge question is just a long password (recovery key). Maybe it requires access to another system, which you likely don&#x27;t have in this circumstance. So you&#x27;re either back to having passwords, or you&#x27;re f-ed. Security theater or a disaster.
A service only has value if I can access it. I should be able to sit down at any computer in the world with the knowledge in my head and get access to any online service to which I subscribe.</span>

My aunt was alone for the last three years of her live, up to 94 years old. She had almost no visitors, and was not able to go out by herself. I went there about every week, and was always the only visitor.
Then came the funeral, with well over 400 people there, and around 200 people at the coffee table after the funeral. And I was like: Where the hell were you guys the past three years? She was alone (after her husband died) and most of you never visited her since (and no they were not living far away or unable to visit).
Go to the funeral yes, but don&#x27;t wait until.</span>

                              <span>Nothing because I’m a senior and LLM’s never provide code that pass my sniff test, and it remains a waste of time.
I have a job at a place I love and get more people in my direct network and extended contacting me about work than ever before in my 20 year career.
And finally I keep myself sharp by always making sure I challenge myself creatively. I’m not afraid to delve into areas to understand them that might look “solved” to others. For example I have a CPU-only custom 2D pixel blitter engine  I wrote to make 2D games in styles practically impossible with modern GPU-based texture rendering engines, and I recently did 3D in it from scratch as well.
All the while re-evaluating all my assumptions and that of others.
If there’s ever a day where there’s an AI that can do these things, then I’ll gladly retire. But I think that’s generations away at best.
Honestly this fear that there will soon be no need for human programmers stems from people who either themselves don’t understand how LLM’s work, or from people who do that have a business interest convincing others that it’s more than it is as a technology. I say that with confidence.</span>

                              <span>&gt; markets enforce efficiency, so it&#x27;s not possible that a company can have some major inefficiency and survive
This just seems totally false on its face. If you&#x27;ve worked at the big guys you know they aren&#x27;t magically smarter, they do very inefficient things frequently.
It&#x27;s so intuitively false that I&#x27;d have to wonder about someone who thinks it&#x27;s true.</span>

                              <span>This post is so interesting to me, esp. the build-vs-buy spectrum.
As Dan notes, a lot of software is just...not very good. It either isn&#x27;t upfront with flaws (as in the case of the Postgres -&gt; Snowflake tool), has too much scope, or is abstracted poorly. Finding things to buy/use (as in the case of open source) can often eat a lot more time than you anticipate.
I&#x27;ve been dipping my toes into the JS ecosystem, and I keep bumping into the fact that using mentally cheap signals of quality (such as stars or DL counts) almost never indicates the quality of the thing itself. Winners seem to be randomly chosen, almost! The only way to assess is to read the code and try integrating it in.
I&#x27;d go farther to argue that the larger an ecosystem/market is, the more untrustworthy it behaves as a whole, simply due to the size, and the types of people attracted to it who want to get influence/money. See also: appliances that everyone needs.</span>

                              <span>This is emblematic of the LLM race in general. We’re actively pressured to use co-pilot at work, and it’s crammed into every Microsoft product. I’m thankful that my iPhone is old enough not to use LLMs. Companies are afraid of being left behind in the new arms race, but that doesn’t actually mean that the technology actually present use-cases which most people need. (Worse are the meeting summaries or emails which are written by LLMs. The summaries are just not very good, and any sort of LLM writing is a tacit acknowledgement that people don’t really care what they are writing, an that no one is really reading that writing very carefully.)</span>

These are all inputs into the design. But a design is still needed, of the appropriate size, otherwise you&#x27;re just making things up as you go. You need to define the problem your are solving and what that solution is. Sometimes that&#x27;s a 1-page doc without a formal review, sometimes it&#x27;s many more pages with weeks of reviews and iterations with feedback.
Don&#x27;t forget: &quot;weeks of coding can save hours of planning&quot; ;)</span>

Became a full blown addict after getting prescribed for the subsequent back injury.
She lost everything, disappeared, became a homeless addict drifting from DC to Baltimore to NYC and back, until she died of an overdose of heroin in a parking lot of a 7-11 in DC in December 2015.  Her story and the impact on me and my 4 siblings is a drop in an ocean of suffering these smug assholes inflicted on this country.
This slap on the wrist is an insult to all of us, especially us Appalachians, who saw this starting in the 90s and got ignored because “hillbillies are genetically prone to addiction” as Purdue told the FDA.</span>

                              <span>There are some pretty callous comments on this thread.
This is really sad. Suchir was just 26, and graduated from Berkeley 3 years ago.
Here’s his personal site: https://suchir.net/.
I think he was pretty brave for standing up against what is generally perceived as an injustice being done by one of the biggest companies in the world, just a few years out of college. I’m not sure how many people in his position would do the same.
I’m sorry for his family. He was clearly a talented engineer. On his LinkedIn he has some competitive programming prizes which are impressive too. He probably had a HN account.
Before others post about the definition of whistleblower or talk about assassination theories just pause to consider whether, if in his position, you would that want that to be written about you or a friend.</span>

He always does that to give himself cover, but he has clearly shown that his words mean very little in this regard. He always dodges criticism. He used to talk about the importance of him being accountable to the OpenAI board and them being able to fire him if necessary when people were questioning the dangers of having one person have this much control over something as big as bleeding edge AI. He also used to mention how he had no direct financial interests in the company since he had no equity.
Then the board did fire him. What happened next? He came back, the board is gone, he now openly has complete control over OpenAI, and they have given him a potentially huge equity package. I really don&#x27;t think Sam Altman is particularly trustworthy. He will say whatever he needs to say to get what he wants.</span>

                              <span>I guess it&#x27;s not news but it is pretty wild to see the level of millenarianism espoused by all of these guys.
The board of OpenAI is supposedly going to &quot;determine the fate of the world&quot;, robotics to be &quot;completely solved&quot; by 2020, the goal of OpenAI is to &quot;avoid an AGI dictatorship&quot;.
Is nobody in these very rich guys&#x27; spheres pushing back on their thought process? So far we are multiple years in with much investment and little return, and no obvious large-scale product-market fit, much less a superintelligence.
As a bonus, they lay out the OpenAI business model:
&gt; Our fundraising conversations show that:
&gt;   * Ilya and I are able to convince reputable people that AGI can really happen in the next ≤10 years
&gt;   * There’s appetite for donations from those people
&gt;   * There’s very large appetite for investments from those people</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;42407396">

                              <span>Congrats! The design looks nice, but I&#x27;m not very fond of the website design. There isn&#x27;t a single picture of Trefolo that doesn&#x27;t crop-out some part of it. Also, every picture is in a &quot;sterile&quot; environment. It would be nice to have a picture of it on a real kitchen counter or coffee corner to put its dimensions into perspective, and also demonstrate how it &quot;fades back into the environment&quot;.
Also, IMHO, the sustainability pitch is a nice one but needs to be put down in more precise terms. It is good as it is for people who would otherwise buy a Nespresso machine, but anyone who has bought something above that level would need more convincing.
Overall, a good espresso machine already scores pretty high sustainability-wise. Apart from the used of sustainable/premium materials, a key factor to that is the replacement parts and repairability. So, how does Trefolo do in terms of replacement parts and compatibility with 3rd party parts?
For me, the future lack of replacement parts is especially concerning for the Turbina coffee grinder. The use of bespoke grinding burrs adds a wow factor and may be functionally superior to other types of burrs. But this is the one part in the whole setup that is guaranteed to need replacement down the road. What are the provisions for that? How much would it cost? And if you decide to stop selling it, would you e.g. be willing to commit to releasing the burr design so owners or some independent manufacturer can machine replacements?</span>
