                              <span>I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate “cloud shit”, and a small part of me is convinced that literally no one actually likes it, and everyone is playing a joke on me.
I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.
I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.
If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been happily using an iPhone 8 for the last 7 years. It has been, and still is, a perfect smartphone. I&#x27;ve never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I&#x27;ve never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.
About a year ago the battery wasn&#x27;t making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.
But then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device&#x27;s release date1. So I&#x27;m stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.
And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly fun…</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

In this regard, one must not be fooled by the pro-expansionist or interventionist rhetoric or record of some of his cabinet picks, like Marco Rubio. These folks have no fixed political compass but political self-interest, and they will adjust to Trump’s instincts, outlook, and agenda. More

                              <span>Before and after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, Biden showed a distinct lack of interest in actual diplomacy to prevent the war or to end it. Three days before the invasion, writing in the Financial Times, Jeffrey Sachs pointed out: “Biden has said repeatedly that the U.S. is open to diplomacy with Russia, but on the issue that Moscow has most emphasized -- NATO enlargement -- there has been no American diplomacy at all. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has repeatedly demanded that the U.S. forswear NATO’s enlargement into Ukraine, while Biden has repeatedly asserted that membership of the alliance is Ukraine’s choice.” More

                              <span>The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social problems afflicting national working classes have been “managed”—at least temporarily—by scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating. In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be “tough on immigrants” showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration. Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as “protecting the nation against an immigrant ‘invasion’” widely prevailed. More

Well... I would be remiss if I didn’t talk about an important life event.
Yesterday marked Cocoa’s 2nd year of life— not her 2nd birthday, but the 2-year anniversary of when the universe (or choose your own higher being) gave us more time with her.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Thanksgiving 2022. We just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner and were relaxing, watching TV. Cocoa was lying on the couch when she suddenly started dry heaving, as if trying to throw up but with nothing to expel.
Strange.
We took her outside. She was on and off dry heaving. Nothing was coming out. Maybe she wanted to go use the bathroom. She walked very slowly, something clearly off. We brought her back inside, her little body feeling so tender.
She wasn…</span>

                              <span>我的公司距离我的家有 17km 距离，所以我每天会花单程 30-40mins 的时间开车通勤。今天简单说说我怎么度过这每天一个多小时的时间。
🎵 听音乐
通勤时间总是无聊的，我最早的时候是听歌。但是我这个人有一个毛病，很难听得进去新歌，但是我的收藏列表我又听烂了。所以现在通勤路上听音乐的频率较少，也会，但不多。
📻 听播客
我个人很喜欢听播客，不光在通勤的时候会听。但是我又很挑，对于信息和内容输出质量很低的播客我极少收听。所以我有一个白名单，一旦白名单的播客更新，我才会考虑听。所以，不会每天有一个小时的可收听量。
📚 听书
这个是我最近半个月养成的新习惯，起因是我在一些播客中听到过一些书籍的分享，但是我又没有很好的建立起读新书的习惯，所以我就瞅准了通勤这段时间。恰好微信读书又有听书模式，如果你是付费会员，可以想听歌一样的听书。这简直是一举多得，解决了我通勤路上恰好收听内容不足的隐患，又拓展了「阅读量」，还能完成微信读书的任务。

▲ 阅读了 13 天的成果
关于微信读书我准备后面找时间专门写一篇有趣的观察和思考，作为产品分析吧。
💬 总结
综上所述，我现在通勤路上依然会听歌和听播客，听歌比较少，听播客比听音乐稍多。这两者的区别在于听歌可以随时开播，听播客我需要提前甄选一下听的内容。如果两者都不想实施，我使用了微信读书的听书来补齐，这样又可以在这个通勤的时间段内拓展出一个内容输入的渠道。可喜可贺。</span>

It&#x27;s not just a loss for society.  It&#x27;s society-killing.
Taking resources away from those who move society forward and spending them on those who are unlikely to &quot;pay it back&quot; is a way your culture dies.  Conquerers in the past used this strategy to win massive empires for themselves.  It&#x27;s a ridiculous self-own.
This is perhaps the sole political topic I will die on a hill for.</span>

                              <span>It’s not just California, but California may be one of the more egregious state neglecters.
The push at the state level for policies that focus on equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities will not end well for the gifted and talented communities.
Whenever I hear these people talk about their policies, I can’t help but recall Harrison Bergeron.
Focusing on equality of outcomes in a society that structurally does not afford equality of opportunities is a fool’s game that ends with Bergeron-esque levels of absurdity.
Imho, the only viable/main solution is to acknowledge that we all aren’t equal, we don’t all have access to the same opportunities, but as a country we can implement policies that lessen the imbalance.
Head Start is a good example.
Well-run gifted and talented programs in schools are also good examples.
Killing truly progressive programs for the purpose of virtue signaling is a loss for society.</span>

                              <span>&gt;I wonder if you exclude &quot;recalls&quot; resolved by software updates, for all cars, where it would rank then?
Why have you put &quot;recalls&quot; in quotes?  It gives the impression you think this makes it somehow lesser.  The cybertruck, for example, was subject to a recall because the rearview camera wouldn&#x27;t come up, but the mirrors are insufficient to back the vehicle up safely without the camera.
That&#x27;s a safety issue, irrespective of whether or not the fix was in software.</span>

Well, for this birthday edition of our restoration project, the 307 engine has completed its full rebuild. While much of the details of how this is all done went way over my head, what I do know is all the shiny bits from the last post now live inside the engine. Not to understate the amount of back-breaking labour my father went through to get it all set up, but the orange boi has all the requisite parts strapped on and is ready to rock and roll!

It was with much excitement and a little trepidation that I approached the milestone of this engine&#x27;s 55th birthday compared to my measly 34 years of age. Would these shiny bits of expensive metal, meticulously installed into the bowels of this mysterious orange machine, reignite its thumping heartbeat in a flurry of noise and smoke?

Yes…</span>

                              <span>After a two-month writing hiatus, I&#x27;m back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.
Two weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I&#x27;m gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.
Transportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I&#x27;ve opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.
This isn&#x27;t my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I&#x27;m visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic &quot;konnichiwa&quot;s.
My ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.
My professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I&#x27;ll join a new workplace where I&#x27;ve already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m really lucky to have found such an environment, and I&#x27;m hopeful about building a long-term community here.</span>

Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, I&#x27;m just observing a theme on here. Sometimes I can feel out of my depth here with it all, I only know basic html and although I do code, it&#x27;s in R (woo lets go statistics). Just sometimes I can feel a bit lonely on here browsing etc because none of my hobbies or pursuits have been reflected on here as of yet :0.

I was curious to see how it would affect my mental health as well the amount of time I spend online. Things didn’t exactly go to plan, but I did come away with some interesting take aways and some ideas on how I want to proceed in the future.
The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine. I didn’t respond to any, because I prefer to type on a real keyboard, but it helped me keep track of some Amazon orders as well as a few other things I had goi…</span>

                              <span>As I strolled through yet another city on a mid-week trip, I came across a cozy-looking coffee shop. Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today&#x27;s newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I&#x27;ve always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.

Author made a couple of fundamental mistakes: the first is they assume employees are (or should be) paid according to how much they &quot;individually&quot; earned the company. Employers strive to pay employees the minimum they can bear, on employer&#x27;s terms. Those terms are information asymmetry and a Gaussian distribution. Fairness is the last thing one should expect from employers, but being honest about this is not good for morale, so instead, they rely on keeping employees uninformed, while the employers collude to gather everyone&#x27;s remuneration history via the Work Number.
The second mistake they made is assume that companies would prioritize being lean and trimming the mediocre &amp; bottom 5%. There are other considerations, combined productivity is more important than having individual superstars working on the shiniest features. How much revenue do you think a janitor or café staffer generates? Close to zero. The same goes for engineering. Someone has to do the unglamorous staff, or you end up with a dysfunctional company, with amazing talent (on paper).
Edit: there&#x27;s an infamous graph that shows when aggregate worker productivity and average income. The two tracked closely, rising in tandem until the 1970s, where they got decoupled. With income becoming much flatter, and productivity continuing to rise. That&#x27;s how the world has been for the past 50 years on the macro and the micro</span>

As described in our previous post, bank failures—including those that involve bank runs—are typically preceded by a slow deterioration of bank fundamentals and are hence remarkably predictable. In this final post of our three-part series, we relate the findings discussed previously to theories of bank failures, and we discuss the policy implications of our findings.</span>

They pay attention to their bank accounts (if they still have them). And they think groceries were cheaper when Trump was in office, and maybe remember the stimulus payments Trump signed.

                              <span>On November 14, 2023, a month into Israel’s genocidal attack on the Palestinians in Gaza, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, one of the leaders of Ansar Allah and of the government of Yemen, delivered a speech that was broadcast on Al-Masirah television. “Our eyes are open to constant monitoring and searching for any Israeli ship,” he said. “The enemy relies on camouflage in its movement in the Red Sea, especially in Bab al-Mandab, and [does] not dare to raise Israeli flags on its ships.” The Bab al-Mandab, the Gate of Grief, is the 14-nautical-mile wide waterway between Djibouti and Yemen. What is interesting is that, by United Nations treaty, a country claims 12 nautical miles as its territorial limit; this means a large part of the waters are within Yemen’s jurisdiction. More

                              <span>It&#x27;s important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it&#x27;s no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado&#x27;s thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.
Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.</span>

                              <span>It’s great satire, but it really does mirror a larger societal shift where the burden of safeguarding personal autonomy has shifted from institutions/regulators to individual users. Do-Not-Stab, Do-Not-Track, whatever it might be, any sort of “voluntary compliance” is a non-starter in the face of financial pressures

Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call &quot;modern&quot;, and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it&#x27;s 10% of Denmark&#x27;s total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it&#x27;s actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn&#x27;t drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don&#x27;t need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.</span>

                              <span>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve worked at multiple places that ran shell scripts just fine for their deploys.
- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.
- One was in an industry that didn&#x27;t need &quot;Webscale&quot; (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.
Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.
The place I&#x27;m at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.
I don&#x27;t fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that&#x27;s less successful that removing complexity in the first place.</span>

There’s a lot of not so great things happening in the world right now that we often forget to be thankful for the little things.
Or is that just me?
I used to write one line a day of things that I was grateful for. In every day life, I would find something that I am thankful for. It could be as little as the sun came out today after days of rain to big things like I got the promotion I’ve been waiting for today.
Then I stopped.
It was hard to keep up with. I was struggling to find the silver lining in things. I got tired of people telling me it happened for a reason. You’ll see!
With Thanksgiving in the horizon, I want to bring a little bit of that grateful attitude back. I know, I know,…</span>

                              <span>重新开始公开写日记。
Why
前一段时间发现自己在浑噩过日子，并不是像一具行尸走肉，而是缺少自律的可持续的沉淀过程。熟悉我的朋友可能知道，我运营了一个名叫不求甚解的 Telegram 频道，这是我的得意之作，也是我的心头之痛。为什么这么讲，得意的是因为我在运营这个介质的同时获得了诸多关注和肯定，难过的是我经常缺少更新它的动力。
但是我经常思考。是的，作为一个 INTJ-A，我是非常喜欢思考，人生经历了 30 多年，到达了现在的阶段，我已经养成了时刻思考的能力和习惯，但是我缺少系统化沉淀的动作。
所以，我准备开启我人生的新阶段 ———— 养成自律的思考到沉淀的链路。
How
我准备按照时间周期的维度产出一些内容：
[Daily] 每天在这里写日记，哪怕是流水账；
[Weekly] Telegram 频道一周至少 3 更；
[Monthly] 召集思想同频的小伙伴录制播客。
Specially
需要说明几点，以上产出的内容，都是为了我自己，如果能帮助到此刻正在看的你，我很荣幸，但这不是我的职责以及初心。
最后，除了上面那些看起来很高大上的原因外，另外一个让我开始想要系统化记录自己生活的原因，是因为我看到了我的朋友 61 正在这么做，能够通过他的内容中感受到他对生活的热爱以及快乐，我也同样需要这些。
以上，祝各位都好。</span>

                              <span>A contradictory title from someone who lives in a country that is among the world&#x27;s largest coffee consumers, and who loves a Swedish fika.
The title, of course, refers to the &quot;Buy Me a Coffee&quot; buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it&#x27;s often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn&#x27;t feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian &quot;jantelagen&quot; (Law of Jante). I don&#x27;t know.
I don&#x27;t blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it&#x27;s nice to know that I don&#x27;t &quot;have to.&quot; And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you&#x27;re ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I&#x27;ll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️</span>

Title: Responce to ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot, or the Necessity to Write Our Own Histories’
Notes: This essay is a response to Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot, or the necessity to write our own histories which was posted to BC Counter Info on Nov 9th, 2024.

 ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot’ has the posture of a disappointed lover who didn’t make it into their songwriter ex’s latest LP. None of the songs are about them, so they leave a scathing review. 
 The anonymous author argues that Yintah should have included the history of anarchist participation in the Wet’suwet’en struggle. I agree that the film is incomplete witho…</span>

People lower down the chain are insecure because they could legitimately be let go at any time for any reason.
People higher up the chain are insecure because any loss of face is debilitating. Especially having failings pointed out by someone &quot;below&quot; them.</span>

                              <span>Astonishing. Completely backwards. This article describes how to give feedback to your subordinates, not to your superiors. If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it&#x27;s feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don&#x27;t bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.
The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don&#x27;t yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.
The reason you don&#x27;t fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.</span>

I&#x27;m going out on a limb here, but if this is the viewpoint of the people who raised him, then I&#x27;m not surprised he cheated.
If this was my son and the facts were the same, he&#x27;d be grounded in addition to whatever consequence the school deems fit.</span>

                              <span>I quit my FAANG job yesterday to join a fully remote company. I took a &gt;50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I&#x27;ve cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don&#x27;t hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal.
Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, find another place to work&quot;. The first good advice I&#x27;ve heard from them in 5 years.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday one of my students asked me, after class was over and she was the last one left in our online classroom, if we would have new classmates next time.
Me: &quot;What do you mean? Like next week?&quot;
Her: &quot;No, like next round, when we do this again.&quot;
She&#x27;d meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her there wouldn&#x27;t be a next round. I said I didn&#x27;t know, and that I&#x27;d have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she&#x27;d asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it&#x27;s when we meet.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been thinking back to that wonderful week I had in the summer when I had no social media on my phone. How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it&#x27;ll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).
The issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn&#x27;t an issue for me last time, this time I&#x27;m still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don&#x27;t want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can&#x27;t help but go to my phone whenever I&#x27;m bored, no matter how much I try to help it.
I&#x27;ve been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I&#x27;ve taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.</span>

                              <span>11/24/24 - Update: After some feedback, I&#x27;ve added some calculations to this post as well as a forgotten subscription.
Subscriptions are a necessary evil these days. It seems like everyone wants to you to subscribe to whatever they offer and as much as I try to avoid subscriptions, I still have a huge list of them I pay for each month.
I try to take advantage of annual sales around Black Friday and so I thought now would be a good time to recap what I&#x27;ve subscribed to this past year and see whether or not I found value in the subscription. If anyone else makes a list like this, please let me know, I love unbiased opinions on these sorts of things.
I did not include any trial subscriptions or anything that I paid for less than three months.

This is not a professional article, it’s a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn’t the US private sector I’m talking about, it may not match your experiences.
I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.

                              <span>This is a sentiment that I&#x27;ve seen expressed in comment sections many times. I&#x27;ve been programming professionally now for 10 years, and it just doesn&#x27;t resonate with my experience. Problems with build systems for external dependencies, package managers, and underfeatured / overcomplicated / buggy third party dependencies have been by far the worse issue in my career, compared to problems with homebrewed systems.
I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, I don&#x27;t doubt that many people have the opposite experience. It just makes me feel a bit alien when I read comments like this.</span>
