                              <span>Disclosure: HPC admin who works with NIVIDA cards here.
Because, no. It&#x27;s not as simple as that.
NVIDIA has a complete ecosystem now. They have cards. They have cards of cards (platforms), which they produce, validate and sell. They have NVLink crossbars and switches which connects these cards on their card of cards with very high speeds and low latency.
For inter-server communication they have libraries which coordinate cards, workloads and computations.
They bought Mellanox, but that can be used by anyone, so there&#x27;s no lock-in for now.
As a tangent, NVIDIA has a whole set of standards for pumping tremendous amount of data in and out of these mesh of cards. Let it be GPU-Direct storage or specialized daemons which handle data transfers on and off cards.
If you think that you can connect n cards on PCIe bus and just send workloads to them and solve problems magically, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself a lot, both performance and psychology wise.
You have to build a stack which can perform these things with maximum possible performance to be able to compute with NVIDIA. It&#x27;s not just emulating CUDA, now. Esp., on the high end of the AI spectrum (GenAI, MultiCard, MultiSystem, etc.).
For other lower end, multi-tenant scenarios, they have card virtualization, MIG, etc. for card sharing. You have to complete on that, too, for cloud and smaller applications.</span>

                              <span>Off topic but if I may. The way people use percentages to express multiples is confusing. A doubling is a 100% increase. So a 200% increase is 3x, and so on. Then at some point we forget about the +1 and 1000% is &quot;10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses&quot;. Just a pet peeve I guess : )</span>

                              <span>I read Steven&#x27;s blog post this morning about imposter syndrome and the feelings that arise about sharing one’s work.
I embody those same sentiments.
A lot of my friends and family don’t know I blog or make zines. This breaks my heart because I consider these creative pursuits a big part of my life. It’s what I spend the most time thinking about.
Only recently have I nonchalantly told my bf about my website and zine making. It felt like a big deal sharing that information bc I&#x27;m such a private person, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s checked it out yet.

It&#x27;s been seven months since I started my weekly email letters, and I&#x27;ve put so much work into these missives.
I&#x27;ve asked people to financially support my email letters, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not panning out, and I&#x27;m unsure how to move forward.
Working towards something without moving the needle doesn&#x27;t feel good.
It sucks to admit failure, and it sucks that it&#x27;s not working out. Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn&#x27;t enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.
Much self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making. When my efforts prove financially unsuccessful, it feels like a direct hit to my purpose/aim in life, which is a terrible feeling to reconcile. I have no idea how to untangle this.
Do I hit delete on my online efforts/website and write anonymously somewhere else? Perhaps.</span>

                              <span>Having some extra time on my hands these past few weeks has been nice. I’ve cleaned the house, honed my cooking skills, and spent a lot of time in contemplation. Normally, I feel like I’m going so fast, I really don’t have time to think about who I am or what I’m doing. I’m just reacting, then reacting some more, and clinging onto anything that’ll get me through the day.
Living in such a way has no doubt created a bit of an identity crisis for me. I haven’t had this much free time to just feel myself out and discover the true me. Interestingly, things haven’t gone exactly the way I thought they would.
The internal battle I’ve dealt with my entire life has been this idea of masculinity vs. myself. I’ve convinced myself that the things I like are beneath me or should be in the past. My inter…</span>

To ensure their stability, it is desirable for banks to hold a diverse portfolio of loans originating from various borrowers and sectors so that idiosyncratic shocks to any one borrower or fluctuations in a particular sector would be unlikely to cause the entire bank to go under.

This is what I believe:
The Universe is Neutral. It Neither Loves Nor Hates You - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that &quot;everything will be all right&quot; because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens.

                              <span>Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a while but couldn&#x27;t gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn&#x27;t work long-term. You don&#x27;t smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you&#x27;re never free from the thought &quot;I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now.&quot; That&#x27;s why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn&#x27;t help me), or some other activity where you don&#x27;t think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it&#x27;s simply a fact I didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with games if they don&#x27;t interfere with main tasks and don&#x27;t cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people&#x27;s blogs. Until recently, I didn&#x27;t even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people&#x27;s posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I&#x27;m very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it&#x27;s much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.</span>

Bacteria is not usually found in most organs in the body though. Even more so in an organ as important as the brain that even our own immune system doesn&#x27;t have access. The brain has its own cells to do that job. In order for bacteria to cross the blood brain barrier you need bacteria in the blood first, where they aren&#x27;t normally found without getting under fire.
Having bacteria in the gut is more obvious and makes more sense.</span>

One quickstart guide, one &quot;normal&quot; rulebook, and one &quot;law&quot; type rulebook laying out everything in almost procedural style with clear and consistent definitions etc. Many games could benefit from that.</span>

                              <span>Once you try the demos, the animated image at the top feels misleading. Each segment cuts at just the right point to make you think you’d be able continue exploring these vast worlds, but in practice you can only walk a couple os steps before hitting an invisible wall, which becomes more frustrating than not being able to move at all. It feels like being trapped in a box. My reaction went from impressed to disappointed fast.
I get these are early steps, but they oversold it.</span>

                              <span>I feel like this is a mistake. Pat&#x27;s strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel&#x27;s stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don&#x27;t think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&amp;A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.</span>

                              <span>For those not familiar with recent UK scandals, there has been one ongoing for a few years where there was a bug in a system designed by Fujitsu that was calculating the finances for post offices. This resulted in the system quoting wrong balances for post offices, and when that didn&#x27;t match the actual cash in hand, resulted in prosecutions of the postmasters responsible for those offices which in turn led to convictions, dismissals, fines, imprisonments, and suicides over a 15 year period as the computer system was presumed correct.
Anyway, it was later proven the computer system was incorrect but the government there dragged their heels on exoneration and compensation.

                              <span>Film critic Pauline Kael, the epitome of New York sophistication, is often misquoted as having said that she didn’t know anyone who had voted for Nixon. Which is pretty funny. What she in fact said was that she knew “only one person who voted for Nixon,” that the rest of them were “outside my ken,” and that she could feel their presence only sometimes “when I’m in a theater.” Which is no longer funny, just irritating. Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York. Yet, as the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in her new book, the well-publicized contempt of the elites for those they consider “hillbillies” or “rednecks” significantly contributes to our current political malaise.

                              <span>In the West Bank, according to UNRWA, since October 7th, 780 Palestinians have been killed, 174 children among them. Settlers have killed an additional 21 Palestinians. There have been more than 3,500 attacks and incidents from settlers, many of them beatings and burnings of agriculture and homes. American-supplied Israeli rifles and bombs have wounded more than 5,000 Palestinians in the last 13 ½ months. Notably, there have been more than 100 airstrikes; airstrikes had not happened in the West Bank in more than 20 years. 18 of the 168 killed by Israeli warplanes and drones have been children. Before October 7th, the Israeli military gunned down and killed, on average, more than one Palestinian a day. In the first ten months of 2023, Israeli soldiers murdered nearly 50 children in the West Bank. Yet, many in the US believe history started on October 7th, 2023. More

Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh in central India, was then inhabited by nearly 900,000 people. The leakage occurred due to exothermic reactions that set off within a partially buried stainless steel tank containing about 42 tonnes of an extremely volatile and highly toxic chemical called methyl isocyanate (MIC), which was stored in liquid form.

                              <span>I’ve been thinking about a lot of things in my life lately. One of those things is whether I should keep this blog going.
My writing here has dwindled. When I do write, I never have much of anything to say. I’ve never cared if people read what I write here, but I do care that about whether or not I’m writing something meaningful.
Nothing here has felt meaningful in quite a while.
Week Posts feel like something I have to do every week. Other posts just feel like filler, and fluff, and random bullshit that just doesn’t matter.
I wanted this to be fun, and it was. I enjoyed it for a long time. But now it just feels like work, and that’s something I just don’t want it to be.
I don’t know.
I don’t know what to do with this collection of meaningless, pointless words.</span>

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it&#x27;s not my place to change anyone&#x27;s personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children&#x27;s worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that&#x27;s idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can&#x27;t help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won&#x27;t.</span>

                              <span>I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn&#x27;t waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.
Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, &quot;I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....,&quot; which was code for &quot;I want the night off.&quot;
I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.</span>

It didn’t convince the commenters then, and I don’t expect it to be any different here, but I’m putting it on the record anyway.

                              <span>It’s been talked about here before, but fundamentally it’s when the advertising guys won the power struggle over the search engine guys. Previously, advertising was a means to fund cool technology (and also get filthy rich).
Now it’s just a way to make the number perpetually go up, sucking every last drop of value out of the system.
Plus the complete lack of vision or strategy from Google’s senior leadership.</span>

                              <span>The scary part is not the GPS installed by the fleet company that previously owned the car, which in all likelihood was just forgotten there, but the GPS and eSIM that comes with most (all?) new cars and that in most (all?) new cars cannot be disabled.
Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with &quot;driver impairment&quot; tech which was called a &quot;kill switch&quot;. Media rushed to say it&#x27;s not really a kill switch, just &quot;sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements&quot; and &quot;block the driver from operating the vehicle&quot;. So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497
Anyway, I&#x27;m staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I&#x27;ll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.</span>

                              <span>Recently I wrote about needing to quit social media again, and I was debating internally even more after that. I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam&#x27;s post about social media, and it clicked for me.
I deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.
What I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I&#x27;ve grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I&#x27;ve had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.
Now that I&#x27;m unshackled again, I&#x27;m making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I&#x27;m tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I&#x27;m doing the same for other people.</span>

                              <span>Code reviews are supposed to be about improving code quality and sharing knowledge, but when PR comments start hitting the hundreds, something is very wrong. I’ve recently come across a discussion where a new developer joined a team and faced over 300 PR comments on their first contribution. Most of it was stylistic nitpicking. This isn’t just unproductive, it’s outright toxic.
Why This Happens
You’re Not Using Linters or Auto-Formatters
Prettier, ESLint, or Black exist for a reason. Not automating this is borderline malpractice in modern development.
Your Team Has a &quot;Style Over Substance&quot; Obsession
Metrics Gone Wild
Toxic Culture
What Needs to Change
Automate the Trivial Stuff
Focus on What Matters
Define (and Stick To) a Style Guide
Measure the Right Things
Stop Wasting Everyone’s Time
Hundreds of comments on a PR are a red flag, not a badge of honor. It means your process is broken. Fix the culture, fix the tooling, and focus on what actually matters: shipping high-quality, maintainable software. Anything else is just noise.</span>

                              <span>Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.
After moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple &quot;hello&quot; while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.
And wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.
For now, I’m enjoying my role as a &quot;hello-er&quot; and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a &quot;hello-er&quot; could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.</span>

                              <span>Twenty-five years ago this week, the streets of Seattle erupted into the kind of militant protest rarely seen in the US. Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink&#x27;s anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom. More

You need only scan those President-Elect Donald Trump has given key governmental positions: Private Predators, on and offline, with an animus to laws and the bureaucracy that enforces them. This subjugation of the many by the few comes as no surprise as such has always been part of “winning” in “The American Dream” as well as the force behind “American Exceptionalism.” Egalitarianism has always been the soft and fuzzy dream of useful idiots, in the eyes of the Winners.

                              <span>Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.
Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying &quot;FBO&quot; accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer&#x27;s balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse&#x27;s case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I&#x27;m willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.
FWIW, after seeing &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;, I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.

That said, $1/TB for bandwidth overage seems pretty fair. I empathize with the complaining but if the new price is such a ripoff everyone should be recommending what cloud VM provider they&#x27;re migrating to for a better deal.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s backwards.
The LED should be connected to camera&#x27;s power, or maybe camera&#x27;s &quot;enable&quot; signal. It should not be operable via any firmware in any way.
The led also has to be connected through a one-shot trigger (a transistor + a capacitor) so that it would light up, say, for at least 500 ms no matter how short the input pulse is. This would prevent making single shots hard to notice.
Doing that, of course, would incur a few cents more in BOM, and quite a bit more in being paranoid, well, I mean, customer-centric.</span>

                              <span>I deleted my Instagram a few weeks ago. It felt like the most difficult platform to give up in my quest to redefine my relationship to the internet and reduce the time I spent doomscrolling. There was no other social media that had a hold on me quite like Instagram - especially once their infinite scrolling Reels feature became a key part of the app. I made my first account on the app at age 11, meaning I have spent more than half of the days in my life so far logging into the platform.

All Macbooks since then have a camera indicator LED that is (barring the physical removal of the LED) always on at least 3 seconds. This feature is implemented in gates in the power management controller on the camera sub-board.
There&#x27;s a LOT of pitfalls still (what if you manage to pull power from the entire camera sub-assembly?), this was a fun one to threat-model.</span>

                              <span>They are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.
&gt; All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]
&gt; So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.

There&#x27;s far more sensitive and actionable information that can be gathered from me that way! I&#x27;m glad that macOS started putting a light in the menubar when the microphone is in use, but I&#x27;d prefer to have unhackable hardware for that instead.</span>

Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this.</span>

So...I&#x27;m supposed to be on my DevOps arc, but here I am writing a piece on Low Level programming! The pull to this path is too strong, I can&#x27;t fight it..I&#x27;ll get back to DevOps by the end of the week, I promise!
Autograd
There are great references on Autograd:
Pytorch Autograd: text and video.
Medium article
Taken from Pytorch&#x27;s website:
PyTorch’s Autograd feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as gradients) over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.
Machine Learning in general use case.
Machine Learning has been proven to be highly useful in variety of sectors:

I’m trying to catch up with writing, but it seems like I’m trying to catch up with life. A lot of things happened while I was gone. I really need to be reflective and focus on processing my thoughts through writing. I’m back baby.
Every time I experience a break up, I watch “How To Be Single” (2016). It came out when I was near the end of the high school and really didn’t have much dating experience. It’s almost a decade, and I’ve had a lot of romantic misadventures under my belt at this point. I’ve experience everything that movie showed. Also, I just like how charming Dakota Johnson is in this. Every time I watch the film, I relate to all of the characters more and more with every romantic connection I’ve had.
