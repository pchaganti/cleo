The encampments have gone. Tall metal riot fences ring USC. Underpaid security hovers nervously at metal detectors. They paw through your bag when you enter, past the receipts, gum, phone, AirPods, and the overdue library book you never even opened. They’re searching for something. A tent? A Palestinian flag? A keffiyeh? A signed declaration of your commitment against genocide? What they are searching for is unclear, and it’s apparent they themselves don’t even know. The result is not the point; the display is. Like most college campuses, USC is invested in the performative, the circus act in all its summer and acrobatics and glory, something to distract us, for the moment, from the mundanity of reality. The mundanity that college campuses are really just another business: meaningless, archaic, and invested only in its commodification and profit.

                              <span>China has considerable appeal in the Pacific as it offers market and donation benefits that are unencumbered by the regulatory millstones of Western countries, which are also offering deals like Australia’s “Step Up” initiative and development aid, and the US “Pacific Partnership Strategy” on diplomatic engagement and security. These projects have bigger geopolitical agendas than aid projects and are mainly concerned with countering China and undermining Pacific Island autonomy by setting up a donor-recipient dynamic.

There is not a whole lot to do here. With my uncle gone there’s no one to take us out; while healthy, my grandparents can’t walk for very long and neither can my mom. My brother and I are useless on our own. We don’t have a data plan, can’t pay for anything because we don’t have WeChat pay set up (I think you need a Chinese bank account), and can’t even download an offline map to help us get around. If we do go out on our own we’ll have to retrace our steps by memory.

There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.
If I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides.

Many of them have already been displaced two or three times. But all of them know nowhere is safe in Gaza now.

                              <span>I feel I need to report my experience from Denmark, Jutland.
It started with white broad streaks, which most of all looked like fog, but then perhaps after 10 minutes or so, we saw colors of red, purple and green begin to emerge from the these streaks. Most astoundingly it all seemed to emanate from a fluctuating point in the middle of the sky. If you looked closely at this point  you could see it fall into itself, morphing and shifting continuously.
We went around the house and we could purple streaks at the top and orange to red patches at the bottom of the sky.
Colors observed:
Whitish blue,  
Green,
Purple,  
Red,
and Orange
An absolutely a beautiful experience.</span>

                              <span>Will be interesting to see how this affects math research.  He has pumped unthinkable amounts of money into the field.  The only first-class flights I&#x27;ve taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)
Besides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that&#x27;s just the stuff that I&#x27;ve benefited from personally. I know there&#x27;s more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I&#x27;ve never heard of. He was very good to us all.
We&#x27;ve always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.  Simons making $3 billion, the rest of us making 90k apiece.</span>

                              <span>My initial reaction to the ad, upon watching it in the launch event was &quot;huh, that&#x27;s a fun reference to the Hydraulic Press Channel&quot;. The slapstick elements (trumpet noise, squishy balls) made it come across as light-hearted, rather than an ominous display of force by a large company crushing artists&#x27; tools.
This idea of &#x27;squashing all these tools down to a thin slab of glass&#x27; made sense given their somewhat unusual focus on the thinness of the device. It was a bit of a throwback to the early 2010s smartphone innovation, where the size of the devices was the yardstick by which manufacturers would outdo each other. I would charitably interpret it as an uninspired marketing team trying to spin some version of Jobs&#x27; classic &quot;the iPhone is simultaneously an iPod, phone and internet device&quot; - however the party trick is old, and nobody&#x27;s impressed anymore.
Perhaps the blowback is a sign of a wider weariness that people have accumulated towards big tech companies over the past few years, mixed with a nebulous malaise about &#x27;AI&#x27; and what it means for the status quo and people&#x27;s livelihoods.</span>

                              <span>It’s not my place to tell anyone how they should feel about anything, but the number of comments here suggesting people had a strong emotional reaction to this does kinda worry me. How do those of you who feel so strongly about this ad get through daily life? If I was feeling so upset about something like this, life would be pretty bad. Genuine question.
EDIT: I appreciate the amount of good-faith discussion on this comment. To be clear, if your reaction to the ad was along the lines of ‘this is distasteful and I don’t like it’, I totally get that. I’m referring to some of the comments I saw that likened it to ‘stress inducing’ or ‘like watching someone’s arm get cut off’ which are much more emotive.</span>

                              <span>When I was 15 I wanted to be a physicist really bad. My idol was Richard Feynman. I was convinced it was my passion. My purpose. I even made a PowerPoint presentation trying to convince my mom to let me be a physicist. She was not impressed. I could only be a doctor or engineer.
Now when I think about it I like physics but I don&#x27;t feel the same passion I had. I could switch fields and go into physics now. I don&#x27;t want to. It took a while to realise passion is a hoax. A fickle thing you can&#x27;t rely upon.
Only last month I saw a lot of posts on Twitter about AI safety. It got me convinced that no one was paying attention to it much. That I was needed to save the world. Like some superhero. It was my purpose. The feeling only lasted a day.
If I made my career choices according to passion it would be a disaster. Hoping from one passion train to the other. Going nowhere. Whatever you do you will have hard days. Tasks which you don&#x27;t like. Days where it is not fun but a slog. How do you push through when the reason you started on that trajectory is something as &#x27;fickle&#x27; as passion?
For the longest time, I had value addition as the answer. Trying to surround myself with the right people and the right environment. With a combination of pride, you get from getting good at something. You get freedom and rewards proportional to the value you give society.
And it still is true. But &#x27;Passion&#x27; always wins on the branding. It is one word. Evokes strong emotion. It gets the lizard brain going. Only recently I found a word that can tickle my lizard brain the same way and sits well with my personal experience - &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27;.
Sam Altman put it wonderfully. He believes it is his &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27; to bring forth a techno-utopia. And all his choices come from it. It is a powerful thing to have. Your own &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27;. Something you feel is your moral obligation to do on this earth. It is sturdy and powerful. Something that guides the choices you make.
I am trying to define my moral imperative. I believe you should too.</span>

                              <span>A gold Volkswagen Jetta with no seatbelts picks us up from the airport. Our driver talks to Mom in thick accent, slurring syllables together in bunches. There are many words I can’t catch, but the lilting rhythm falls comfortably on my ears.
I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.
Grandpa comes out to greet us as we lurch to a …</span>

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

Hank and John Green: Nerdfighteria is my internet home.
WaitButWhy: Deep dives into topics from first principles and cool sticky figures. Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.
Brandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.
Staring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.
LessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.
Richard Feynman&#x27;s Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…</span>

 The most significant manifestations of capitalist globalization involve banking crises, public and private debts, the consolidation of the debt system, alongside a myriad of other challenges such as economic, food, environmental, and political crises, migration, wars and terrorism. This globalization is considered as an implementation of liberal policies that aim to universalize market logic to all aspects of human activities at the expense of social gains and needs of the (...)

He saw and could explain the ravages of the occupation and the horrors of the war. He was exactly the kind of person, like the still imprisoned Marwan Barghouti, Israel has always feared might become a leader of the Palestinian people. For that reason, he was also exactly the kind of person Israel has been targeting for elimination under the cover of its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. More

                              <span>A discussion of the origins of urbanization may provide some insight into the character of modern social problems by highlighting the long historical dynamic at work. It may not be out of place here to point out that anti‑states are well known in the modern world, above all in what the U.S. Federal Reserve Board classifies as eleven offshore banking centers. Five such enclaves are in the Caribbean: Panama, the Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the British West Indies (Cayman Islands). Three enclaves—Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore—were founded to conduct the China trade. The remaining three are Liberia, Lebanon, and Bahrain at the mouth of the Persian Gulf—the island which Bronze Age Sumerians called Dilmun when they used it to trade with the Indus valley and the Iranian shore.

                              <span>The UAW is on a roll. After winning stupendous contracts at the Big Three automakers this past year, the union then organized Volkswagen in Tennessee April 20. What’s eye-popping about this is that the UAW succeeded not only in the South, but also with a foreign car manufacturer – a twofer. Now as the union zooms in on a May vote by 5000 workers at Mercedes in Alabama, the larger implications of Shawn Fain’s still relatively new union presidency have become clear, namely, a change in workers’ culture in the anti-union, right-to-work South; because if the UAW racks up more wins in the region, that will alter the local political ecosystem. Politicos will find themselves in an environment that includes a growing union presence, something they have sought to extirpate for generations. More

                              <span>It’s difficult to imagine an Israeli war in the Middle East that allowed any Arab country to claim victory.  The history of the Middle East over the past 75 years has been a history of war, and the Israelis have been the overwhelming victor in each and every one of them.  Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 marked an overwhelming victory for the Israelis; it created the profound antagonisms that have marked Israeli relations with the Arab states over the past 75 years.  The United States and Israel over the years have indulged in a dialogue about a “peace process,” but Arab refugees have known neither “peace” nor “process.” More

                              <span>Israel’s disregard for the negotiations and the level of its violence can be measured based on two political realities. It does not take negotiations with the Palestinians seriously and it feels that it can bomb with impunity. This is so because, firstly, Israel is backed fully by the Global North states (mainly the United States and Europe) and secondly, it does not regard Palestinian political views as vital because it has succeeded in breaking the political unity amongst Palestinians and it has succeeded in politically disorienting the various factions by the arrest of their main leadership.

No, the goal is clearly to promote the interests of the few and to use the vast swath of humanity in much the way a parasite would utilize its host. This has likely always been the case with modern governments, but even now, a few nations seem to realize that there has to be some form of quid pro quo between their leaders and the masses. Sadly, however, in the US and Great Britain in particular, there has been a callous disregard for even the most basic well-being of their populations. The question is, how did we get to such a place?

I know, that, specially when you get recognised for the hard work it is hard, but you will regret every minute.
If you work for a company that counts on your holidays and vacation to sell their products, you are helping to create the problematic world with have today.
If many do that, more will need to do. If none do it, and act like it is an absurd to request it (and it is) nobody is forced to do it and the company is forced to do real estimates even if that hurts your fav CEO pocket</span>

                              <span>bears and cats seem to be the only animals other than humans that are able to appreciate a good view. i saw video the other day of a bear digging himself a hole and sitting in it, onlooking a lake somewhere in the banff region. the video reminds me of the times i&#x27;d go to montenegro with my family, id dig pockets into the sand to rest my knees and stomach before laying a towel down and going to sleep. similarly, i often find my cats sitting on their cat towers outlooking the view of the lake from my balcony. genuinely good living. i always get thrown back at idea of humans getting considering as the solely &quot;intelligent&quot; animals. most of us can&#x27;t sit for a few moments and enjoy a good view, meanwhile cat and bears do it all the time. in what world does that make sense?

anyways, i&#x27;ve become a bit more lax with blogging and such. it&#x27;s been a bit of a secondary function these past few months. i get the itch at times to do small things, like write a post, or read, or research or code something. at other times, i get even worse itchings to do more drastic things, move away, quit my job, or delete every trace of myself on the internet and live like a hermit. i get annoyed quite honestly, theres always something to do or something i would like to do, and all these options cause me to paralyze myself. i find myself walking a lot these days. spending most days out of the house, which helps. a little coffee and a walk in nature helps me soothe myself. i feel like the bear in the video. a bit of a hopelessly lost almost-22 year old bear. i think time will probably tell how this all goes.</span>

This release includes the graduation to Standard of four eagerly awaited features.

                              <span>One of the most striking features of the labor market recovery following the pandemic recession has been the surge in quits from 2021 to mid-2023. This surge, often referred to as the Great Resignation, or the Great Reshuffle, was uncommonly large for an economic expansion. In this post, we call attention to a related labor market change that has not been previously highlighted—a persistent change in retirement expectations, with workers reporting much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67. This decline is particularly notable for female workers and lower-income workers.</span>

                              <span>Any impressionable kids reading... this story playing out like it did is highly company-dependent, as well as luck-dependent.
In a healthy company/organization:
* That outsourcing implementation approach probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened, because an experienced person could&#x27;ve guessed how that would turn out, before it was started (it&#x27;s such a cliche).
* Earlier on, people would tell the CTO it wasn&#x27;t working out, instead of lying and saying the opposite.
* Whenever they needed to do something smarter/creative to rescue the project, they could work with the CTO on that, and maybe even with the customer.
* There wouldn&#x27;t be marathon whip-cracking over the holidays, especially not after the team was already burning out.
* A manager/lead would go to bat for the success of the project and the health of the team, and insist upwards that the team needed a break over the holidays, if that needed to be clarified.
On that last point, in a &quot;half-healthy&quot; organization, a manager might intentionally be very vague, and omit information.  That happens, and might or might not be a good idea, depending.
But the way this story is told, it sounds like the manager/lead outright lied repeatedly up the chain of command, which is generally considered very-bad, in both healthy and unhealthy companies.
I&#x27;ll add that these things are vastly easier to armchair-quarterback.  Certainly we&#x27;re all going to make mistakes, especially when put in difficult positions, and/or when overextended/fatigued.  But it helps to look at scenarios, to try to learn from them, and to think from a distance how they might&#x27;ve been handled better, so you&#x27;re armed with that &quot;experience&quot;, the next time you&#x27;re tossed into a rough situation that has some similarities.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a scientist who works in protein folding (or one of those other areas) and strongly believe that science&#x27;s goal is to produce falsifiable hypotheses, these new approaches will be extremely depressing, especially if you aren&#x27;t proficient enough with ML to reproduce this work in your own hands.
If you&#x27;re a scientist who accepts that probabilist models beat interpretable ones (articulated well here: https://norvig.com/chomsky.html), then you&#x27;ll be quite happy because this is yet another validation of the value of statistical approaches in moving our ability to predict the universe forward.
If you&#x27;re the sort of person who believes that human brains are capable of understanding the &quot;why&quot; of how things work in all its true detail, you&#x27;ll find this an interesting challenge- can we actually interpret these models, or are human brains too feeble to understand complex systems without sophisticated models?
If you&#x27;re the sort of person who likes simple models with as few parameters as possible, you&#x27;re probably excited because developing more comprehensible or interpretable models that have equivalent predictive ability is a very attractive research subject.
(FWIW, I&#x27;m in the camp of &quot;we should simultaneously seek simpler, more interpretable models, while also seeking to improve native human intelligence using computational augmentation&quot;)</span>

                              <span>Stepping back, the high-order bit here is an ML method is beating physically-based methods for accurately predicting the world.
What happens when the best methods for computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, nuclear physics are all uninterpretable ML models? Does this decouple progress from our current understanding of the scientific process - moving to better and better models of the world without human-interpretable theories and mathematical models / explanations? Is that even iteratively sustainable in the way that scientific progress has proven to be?

I often say &#x27;machine learning in Elixir is ready for production&#x27;. On further reflection, I realised that this statement dramatically undersells the true potential and capabilities of machine learning within the Elixir ecosystem. (I already posted these reflections on Twitter).
When I say &quot;production-ready,&quot; it&#x27;s not just about the ability to deploy machine learning models in a live environment. In the context of Elixir, being production-ready means deep integration with the weird and wonderful thing called the BEAM (Bogdan/Björn&#x27;s Erlang Abstract Machine). It means seamless compatibility with OTP (Open Telecom Platfo…</span>

                              <span>In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It&#x27;s not poetic; it&#x27;s real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here&#x27;s the truth about living as a paradox:
I&#x27;m drawn to happiness, sure, but I can&#x27;t shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I&#x27;m stuck in the middle.
I&#x27;m not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there&#x27;s a begrudging respect for the person I&#x27;ve become, scars and all.
When I say &quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It&#x27;s just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.
Attention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I&#x27;m just not used to being seen.
I&#x27;ve been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I&#x27;ve tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.
Listening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m great at keeping other people&#x27;s secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I&#x27;d rather keep them locked away.
So yeah, I&#x27;m a walking contradiction. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s confusing, but it&#x27;s real. And maybe that&#x27;s okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life&#x27;s contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.</span>

                              <span>I thought I’d take it easy this trip to Tokyo since I didn’t plan at all. Two days in, I’ve logged 22 miles, 56,000 steps on concrete in barefoot shoes. It’s okay, though—my overworked feet will have time to recover in China. The sheer amount of walking I’ve done is testament both to how pedestrian friendly Tokyo is and to the way I still try to minmax my travels at the expense of my physical and mental health. Old habits die hard.
I wrote a while back about how one of my favorite things about traveling is getting to microdose on cluelessness. These past few days in Japan have taught me that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. The last time I was in a place where I didn’t speak the local language was seven years ago (France and Italy), and there I could at least read, if not u…</span>

                              <span>The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of odd to me (as someone who used to live there at its latest boom time) that nobody talks about Kansas City when it comes to this topic.
From the ~70&#x27;s until the early 2010&#x27;s Kansas City&#x27;s downtown was in a similar &quot;doom loop&quot; of crime, undevelopment, decaying historic buildings, etc... In that city 75% of the metro lives in suburbs, drives in to downtown for work and promptly leaves. Until about 2012 or so. Urban redevelopment kicked in, adding (free!) transit, boosting retail, arts district events, a new stadium, and crucially - *massive office to housing conversion projects*.
There are tons of success stories like the historic Fidelity Tower at 909 Walnut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909_Walnut), a huge 35-story tower that sat vacant (creepy) for the better part of a decade and is now home to 159 units. Ditto with the Power &amp; Light Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Power_and_Light_Bu...) (36 stories) - largely vacant for the better part of 20 years and now home to nearly 300 units. I could go on, every block has similar projects of 100+ year old buildings of nontrivial sizes that are now super unique apartments. I myself lived in the 30-story Commerce Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Tower) for a while and it was incredibly cheap to do so (~$1100/month for 750sqft 1 bed on the 14th floor), I had a 10 minute commute by foot to my office, it was awesome. Even the more squat, broad midsize banking buildings have had major success with residential conversions.
These kinds of conversions have been proven out when there is willpower to do so at the city level - people will move in and prices typically get competitive fast if done at scale. I&#x27;ve lived in SF for 4 years now and I&#x27;m convinced its a policy problem not an economic problem.</span>

Their primary business goal is to sell hardware. Yes, they’ve diversified into services and being a shopping mall for all, but it is about selling luxury hardware.
The promise of privacy is one way in which they position themselves, but I would not bet the bank on that being true forever.</span>

                              <span>Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI.
In case it is not abundantly clear by now: Apple&#x27;s AI strategy is to put inference (and longer term even learning) on edge devices. This is completely coherent with their privacy-first strategy (which would be at odds with sending data up to the cloud for processing).
Processing data at the edge also makes for the best possible user experience because of the complete independence of network connectivity and hence minimal latency.
If (and that&#x27;s a big if) they keep their APIs open to run any kind of AI workload on their chips it&#x27;s a strategy that I personally really really welcome as I don&#x27;t want the AI future to be centralised in the hands of a few powerful cloud providers.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Conventional wisdom is that only certain office buildings can be converted to housing.
If you can buy the building cheap enough, conventional wisdom can be thrown out the window.
I once toured a building that had been converted from an old warehouse to residential.  Huge floorplate.  They had built the condo units around the edges, created a hallway, and then the inside was divided up into &quot;storage&quot; spaces.  Each condo owned the space directly across the hallway.  They were very large, and people had transformed them into offices, arcades, workshops, playrooms, theaters, etc.  You could do just about anything you wanted with the space, and because it wasn&#x27;t &quot;living space&quot; you didn&#x27;t have to worry so much about noise and the property taxes were lower than they otherwise would have been.
You can&#x27;t sell it for a price that includes that space as &quot;living space&quot; either.  Which goes back to the point - if you can buy the building cheap enough, you can make anything work.</span>

I went to a private &quot;college prep&quot; high school, and the amount of assigned, mandatory reading was insane. I spent so much time reading assigned novels that I just didn&#x27;t have time to read for pleasure. (And why read for pleasure if I already spent 30+ minutes reading a boring / awful novel as part of my homework?)
Once I was out of college, I rediscovered reading.</span>

                              <span>There is some more detail on the bridge itself in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8tpv6n1ykfA
The bridge is assembled over 2 nights at a motorway exit (so traffic can bypass it by driving off and immediately back on to the road). During night 1 the two end ramps are assembled and attached together to make a short bridge. During night 2 the ramps are driven apart, the central section is built to reach the full length and the entire structure is driven to the final location.
The entire length is 236 meters long providing a working length of 100 meters underneath. The assembled bridge can flex slightly at the joins between sections, and has a turning radius of 2 kilometers.</span>

                              <span>&quot;With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon’s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power.&quot;
That&#x27;s an incredible improvement in just a few years. I wonder how much of that is Apple engineering and how much is TSMC improving their 3nm process.</span>

                              <span>Recently I discovered that many coffee shops, maybe half in my sampling of a couple dozen in different cities, are selling cold coffee (brewed hot, then refrigerated) under the name cold brew, and even the ones that actually cold-brew them seem to be under the impression that it needs to be served cold. I was laughed at in one hipster joint for asking for a steamed or warmed cold-brew, and another one initially refused my request to warm it up saying that would make the coffee extremely sour. (It didn’t) Oh, and at least one other, maybe two, said they couldn’t warm cold brew (in view of both a steamer and microwave) or would have to charge extra (while someone’s cheaper latte was being steamed).
Reading the paper, it’s not clear whether their cold brew has lower acidity (higher pH) than the same coffee hot brewed. It does say that the sonic-brew has the same pH as the normal long-steep cold brew. I’m also curious if this cavitation/sonication brewing process is basically agitating the coffee, or doing something different, and how different it is from manually agitating a cold brew compared to letting it sit still for hours.</span>

                              <span>Today marks my first completed year of writing on Bear. I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I&#x27;ve gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I&#x27;ve stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.
When I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I&#x27;m not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert. Honestly, if a person had a spiritual exploration in the desert for 40 days, …</span>

While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not. Indeed, job shortfalls remain in more than a quarter of the country’s metro areas, including many in the New York-Northern New Jersey region. In fact, while employment is well above pre-pandemic levels in Northern New Jersey, jobs have only recently recovered in and around New York City, and most of upstate New York—like much of the Rust Belt—still has not fully recovered and has some of the largest job shortfalls in the country.</span>

                              <span>Private equity is akin to toxic poison for everyone who isn&#x27;t one of the (very few) general partners who bask in obscene amounts of scrooge-mcduck money.  Think of making a cool $30 million+ a quarter, per partner -- thanks real estate (and apparently, emergency medical services) &quot;investments&quot;!  This is a direct funnel to syphon money from the workers to the ruling class.  That&#x27;s even more cash than the top brass at FAAGs make.
How can this phenomenon be reigned in and sorted in the medium to long-term?
It&#x27;s a loss for everyone (99.9999%) except the miniscule quantity of winners (0.0001%, yes, that&#x27;s 1 in 1,000,000 - there aren&#x27;t that many large-scale P/E firms).  Housing owned by P/E couldn&#x27;t be more soul sucking.  Scratch that, this applies to every case I&#x27;m aware of where P/E firms own a thing.
Anecdote: Last month my dear old dog was suddenly very ill and I spent $12k on emergency surgery to save his sweet life.  No regrets, I&#x27;m grateful he was fixable.  But in the waiting room I did the conservative math for what the SAGE Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Redwood City, CA makes in a year (before the comparatively small overhead, tax-deductible expenses) and they are pulling in at least $30 million in this single location.  That&#x27;s.. a lot, for many 20 total staff.  Also they charged me $500 for each follow-up visit, which is way more than my real life surgeon charged me earlier this year! (Even including insurance, he didn&#x27;t charge much for the follow-ups to make sure I survived.)  Damn.
For the dog lovers out there: Doggo is alive and well, can maybe last another year or two we hope.
Btw, who owns SAGE?  NVA, a P/E firm.
