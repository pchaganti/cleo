                              <span>A few days before I arrived in Canberra, an aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted the celebration of King Charles III to say, “You are not my king. This is not your land.” It was a powerful demonstration against the treatment of Australia ever since the arrival of English ships to the country’s east in January 1788. In fact, the British crown does claim title to the entirety of the Australian landmass. King Charles III is head of the 56-country Commonwealth and the total land area of the Commonwealth takes up 21 percent of the world’s total land. It is quite remarkable to realize that King Charles III is nominally in charge of merely 22 percent less than Queen Victoria (1819-1901). More

                              <span>On September 25, 2024, Democratic representative Steven Horsford introduced House Resolution 1500 on the floor of Congress. The intent of the resolution was to censure Republican Congressman Glen Clay Higgins of Louisiana over a social media post that amplified false claims made by former president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. In a post on X responding to an Associated Press article about Haitians in Springfield filing charges against Trump and Vance, Higgins wrote: &quot;Lol. These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters… but damned if they don’t feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP.&quot; More

                              <span>&quot;Billing alerts&quot; are a joke, give us hard spend limits. Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.
Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It&#x27;s also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, &quot;I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life&#x27;s savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they&#x27;re coming for my house&quot;, the less they&#x27;ll want to explore your offerings.</span>

                              <span>Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!
Here&#x27;s a start --
&quot;Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc&quot;: No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
&quot;Who uses Keras in production&quot;: Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn&#x27;t all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
&quot;Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019&quot;: I didn&#x27;t! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!</span>

                              <span>It’s been busy (she says, as if her last post wasn’t only a week ago), but last night I dreamt about my best friend B, and it made me happy.
We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group. We talked about the poor man’s David Tennant in our group and B’s weird partner who made them a really elaborate card that B felt burdened by. The conversation was vivid and true to life, and I texted B about it when …</span>

                              <span>Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China&#x27;s income level. We quantify China&#x27;s consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country&#x27;s production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.</span>

Fitzhugh and Oglum take the lead, Jessamine hanging back, nervously looking over her shoulder for enemies. As they enter the valley of Uorek’s Rest a mist hangs low over the trees of the Ancient Forest.
“Finally,” Oglum mutters, “we’re free of those damn mountains.”
Jessamine nods, “I expected we’d be followed, but there’s no sign of, well, anyone.”
None of our heroes have disclosed the particulars of their circumstances, but each knows the others wouldn’t be fleeing through Hangman’s Noose if they had any other choice.
“Two weeks in that pass,” Fitzhugh groans, “and another through the forest before we can expect to reach any civilization.”
They continue on, …</span>

🔬Small web has divided my career life as an indie developer to two phases:
My life before knowing about small web
And my life after knowing it.
What is the small web?
My quick, not complete answer, using an example: Personal websites/blogs people are making and hosting themselves are part of the small web.
You can find many of these websites here:
https://blogroll.org
🔆 You can start learning more about the small web by visiting these websites and keep clicking the links inside them to start a never ending journey into the small web 🐇🕳rabbit hole👇
Learn anything about the small web movement
you can find lots of resources and links to small web projects on this page:

And here in this page Aral, the developer of Kitten (One of the best full stack’s for creating small web apps), talks about the small web.

There&#x27;s a lot to untangle into where I ended up and how and why, and the sense of lingering impermanence that&#x27;s run through this year. But that doesn&#x27;t matter right now. What does matter is that I met a lot of weird little guys and I want to share them with you.
There&#x27;s good cats out there. Take a pet no problem.
Tove (Edinburgh, UK)
Tove is not my cat, but she is the cat I live with. She&#x27;s also less a cat than some kind of cross between a small bird and a meringue, making her strange little chirps for attention all hours of the day. She used to be a terribly shy and anxious thing but has grow…</span>

Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.</span>

                              <span>One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn&#x27;t one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don&#x27;t have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it&#x27;s fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that&#x27;s okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don&#x27;t want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!</span>

                              <span>Note: This one has an HN thread.
I lost a Stripe dispute of USD $210 because the customer that purchased tickets from my site used an email that he claimed to his bank was not his. Stripe and the bank asked me to provide evidence that this wasn&#x27;t fraudulent and I sent them:
The invoice sent to the email the customer entered
The actual tickets that were sent
Despite this evidence I lost the dispute because of the customer&#x27;s &quot;it wasn&#x27;t me&quot; defense. Here&#x27;s Bank of America&#x27;s response:
Compelling documents shows name is matching with customer, but email id and ip address does not match with our customer. No
proof our customer benefited from this transaction. Our customer maintains charge is unauthorized/fraud.
This is a lie because I never even sent them the IP address since that isn&#x27;t shown in…</span>

                              <span>I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.
The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who&#x27;s behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who&#x27;s ahead can be nurtured.
We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t be&quot; was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It&#x27;s such a crying shame.</span>

When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.</span>

                              <span>Feeling melancholic.
I don&#x27;t know what it is. It could be the rain, or it could be because it&#x27;s Monday. Either way, I&#x27;m feeling all the feels today1. I&#x27;m currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather&#x27;s got a mood, and it&#x27;s contagious.
I love the sound of rain. I think it&#x27;s soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it&#x27;s Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.
Maybe it&#x27;s just one of those days. I&#x27;ve done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.
And so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don&#x27;t quite know what to do with just yet.
That&#x27;s all.

It&#x27;s snowing in Eastern Canada! 🤩❄️

It’s a wet day here too. A sort of stead drizzle that just envelops everything in tiny teardrops. Hope you feel less melancholy tomorrow and maye, the sun will come out.

Then again, it&#x27;s been like this more so since a week ago.↩


Today, I got the coffee covered. Blankets, reading and nap will have to wait since I have to work.↩</span>

In short, they can retain 95+% retrieval accuracy with 32x compression and ~25x retrieval speedup. Let&#x27;s get into how this works and why it&#x27;s so crazy.
What are embeddings?
Embeddings let you turn an arbitrary piece of text into a series of numbers that manage to represent the meaning of the content. These embedding vectors can range in dimension from 512 on the shorter end all the way up to 8192 or more. Typically each of the weights in the vector is represented as a 32-bit floating point number.
LLMs use embeddings to represent input text, but embeddings can also be used on their own.
Embeddings enable you to easily search for pieces of content that have similar meanings by finding t…</span>

to-do listlerimin çoğu artık to-think olarak değişmiş vaziyette. serbest çağrışım tabii.
bunu bir üşengeçlik olarak göreceklerin kokusunu buradan alıyorum. bunu bir üşengeçlik, tembellik, zararlı davranış, “öyle olmaz”cılık olarak alanlar oldu, hayatımın her döneminde.
onur ile ocak’ta ikinci senesini dolduracak olan aralıksız her çarşamba oturup en az üç fikir üzerine düşünmelerimizi feyzalarak bir şeyler karalamak istedim. üzerine yoğunlaştığımız bir iş yokken de varken de disiplinli olarak her çarşamba günü, büyük olasılıkla öğlen 12:00 civarında, en az 1 saat boyunca, yoğun bir şekilde odaklanmanın ne demek olduğunu, bu odaklanma halinin işin kendisini yapmaktan ne kadar daha fayadalı olduğunu, çağdaş toplumun yapmaktan …</span>

                              <span>It’s a lazy Sunday morning, September 2015, in Bangalore. The city’s atmosphere makes everyone a little sluggish. Deciding to shake off the weekend haze, I went out and found myself wandering the streets of BTM. Suddenly, a small shop caught my eye, filled to the brim with books—as if there were no bricks in the walls, only shelves and stacks of paperbacks and hardcovers. Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside, calling out to see if anyone was there. An old, weathered hand raised itself from behind a towering pile, and a soft, respectful voice answered, “What do you want, sir?”
Startled, I scanned the room until I spotted an old man in the midst of this sea of books. “Hi,” I replied. “Is this a library or an old bookshop?” He chuckled and explained that it was a private libra…</span>

My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.


Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiency, you can check some of Polars benchmark here.
I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I&#x27;ve been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization.

It&#x27;s a one-page (double-sided) zine about being saddened by the election results, needing a break, starting a new sketchbook, + a mini music list, doodles, and scattered thoughts.
This zine is a limited print of 30 copies. Each copy has red marker accents that are unique to each print.

                              <span>As the FT put it: “In the end, it wasn&#x27;t even close. A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife&#x27;s edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump&#x27;s 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

                              <span>My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple&#x27;s ads for &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they&#x27;re unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband&#x27;s birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly &quot;save the day&quot; by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife&#x27;s case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That&#x27;s part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won&#x27;t make us more perfect. The more we expect &quot;perfection&quot; from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.</span>

I&#x27;ve been noticed online, which is surprising. Scott Jack is the person in question to notice me, indeed he wrote a reply to my blogpost on what I learnt about Bearblog. He raises some good points about one specific section of the post - that being, the part where I mention that I wish there were comment sections.
Maybe I&#x27;m too used to seeing comment sections, what with me growing up in a generation that uses Instagram and TikTok like they&#x27;re vitamin supplements, and comments come naturally with them. The same goes with blogs, before Bearblog almost every post I saw came with one embedded. That&#x27;s not to say blogs with comment sections are better, …</span>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown. 
 Wolfe describes such charter cities as “special economic economic zones that are still bound by criminal law but able to create their own c…</span>

                              <span>This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the &quot;aliveness&quot; of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label &quot;life&quot; - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don&#x27;t add anything to the science.
Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell&#x27;s machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?
The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn&#x27;t the case. Lynn Margulis&#x27;s endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that&#x27;s how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.</span>
