Printed in childlike lowercase letters, the words interspersed between the leaves of a simply rendered sunflower, it was an early response to America’s war in Vietnam. “She just wanted to make something that nobody could argue with,” recalled Schneider’s youngest daughter, Elisa Kleven, in an article published earlier this year. Six decades later, Schneider’s hypothesis has consistently been borne out. More

Now, by dressing Palestinian civilians in military garb and sending them into the tunnels, the Israeli military has, in effect, altered the very logic of human shielding. More

                              <span>When I was first learning computer vision, I wrote a program that could tell the time from an image of a clock [1]. I had no purpose for it besides the fact that it seemed like a cool problem to try and solve.
Years later, I get an email from a stranger in Korea, asking me how to run my program. Why would he want to use my silly program? Turns out you can adapt the code to read analog pressure gauges which is really useful for chemical plants. Goes to show that there&#x27;s often a use for most things.

                              <span>A quick Google search will tell you that Mark’s Gulfstream G650 has tail number N68885.
The FAA mandates that the jet broadcast its location over ADS-B,
mostly to avoid being hit by other jets.
There are fortunately many websites that aggregate data from honorable volunteers with ADS-B receivers. So much that it’s easy to determine Mark probably took a trip to Cabos in late September.
I suppose it’s not explicitly public that it’s mark’s jet, the FAA has it registered to A7P TRUST CO INC TRUSTEE in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Another quick Google will lead you to an article that talks about how Mark’s last house was sold by an LLC managed by A7P (real estate transactions and their parties are also public data in most US jurisdictions). It’s not as if these accounts were revealing deep secrets, that were otherwise undiscoverable.
I guess now he knows how the rest of us feel about be tracked?</span>

                              <span>These Google scans are also available in the HathiTrust [1], an organization built from the big academic libraries that participated in early book digitization efforts. The HathiTrust is better about letting the public read books that have actually fallen into the public domain. I have found many books that are &quot;snippet view&quot; only on Google Books but freely visible on HathiTrust.
If you are a student or researcher at one of the participating HathiTrust institutions, you can also get access to scans of books that are still in copyright.
The one advantage Google Books still has is that its search tools are much faster and sometimes better, so it can be useful to search for phrases or topics on Google Books and then jump over to HathiTrust to read specific books surfaced by the search.

As someone building AI SaaS products, I used to have the position that directly integrating with APIs is going to get us most of the way there in terms of complete AI automation.
I wanted to take at stab at this problem and started researching some daily busineses and how they use software.
My brother-in-law (who is a doctor) showed me the bespoke software they use in his practice. Running on Windows. Using MFC forms.
My accountant showed me Cantax - a very powerful software package they use to prepare tax returns in Canada. Also on Windows.
I started to realize that pretty much most of the real world runs on software that directly interfaces with people, without clearly defined public APIs you can integrate into. Being in the SaaS space makes you believe that everyone ought to have client-server backend APIs etc.
Boy was I wrong.
I am glad they did this, since it is a powerful connector to these types of real-world business use cases that are super-hairy, and hence very worthwhile in automating.</span>

edit: it doesn&#x27;t seem so. You just have use some weasel language:

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

The Vancouver International Film Festival took place recently and it happened to overlap with the closure of social media site Cohost.org. Everyone got a little over a month of heads up to give time to say goodbyes and let everyone know where they were heading to next but for the most part we got a month’s worth of mourning, posting through it, remembering the good times, and sharing stories of personal growth as it related to the site’s culture.

Friday Night in West Ealing
I like how Ella describes the absolute thrill of finding an anonymous zine in the wild somewhere. It&#x27;s true. It makes it a more magical reading experience.
I only have a few issues of Cow Eyes, since it&#x27;s all the way from Australia, but i cherish every issue. She writes zines with her typewriter and fills them with drawings, poetry, short stories, and bits of thoughts from her diary.

You can get both of these zines at: Small Zine Volcano.
Give the convo a listen, I promise, it&#x27;s a good one ;)</span>

What are mycorrhizae?
 mycorrhizae (pronounced “my-core-ih-zigh”) are mutual relationships between fungi and plant roots. They move nutrients between plants they are connected to. They can also sap nutrients from one part of a fungal network. They spread vastly within an ecosystem in ways that prevent researchers from being able to trace where the network begins or ends. They play both pathogenic and symbiotic roles. They develop in very steady, slow ways. Occasionally you see mushrooms sprouting up, aboveground, but mycorrhizae are primarily an underground entity.

These days, as we protest the genocide of the Palestinian people in front of the Atomic Bomb Dome here in Hiroshima, it is impossible not to recall the radioactive fires and mass death as part of a long lineage of American weapons experiments that continue to this very moment in Palestine.

It&#x27;s good that public school exposes children to many subjects - hopefully most of them. So that they can discover if they click with one of them. The real danger is that someone never gets exposed to a subject at all. College is the place to specialize in a subject.</span>

What really stuck out to me was how R failed in a bunch of other subjects except math because he wasn’t interested in them.
I know society and norms expect students to learn all these other subjects.
But what if those just aren’t interesting to someone?
I wonder how many geniuses we skip on because doing the chores of homework and getting through boring classes is busywork and memorization for the sake of getting an A.
Meanwhile, hardly anyone actually remembers anything about those topics and even the best students mostly go on  to achieve only above average things.
My class valedictorian went on to become a doctor and while that is certainly impressive to me, there are many doctors and he practices (like almost every other doctor) and isn’t pushing the boundaries of medical science. I feel terrible writing that because I’m certainly not as smart as him, but R is just so impressive and I’m glad he got his lucky break.
People like R would be lost in the sea of averages because their genius would be kept shut by norms.
Almost every extraordinary person I read about seems like they were 1 step away from being forgotten, and got some huge universal break that boosted them.</span>

                              <span>Civet. Kopi luwak coffee. It&#x27;s CoffeeScript.
I wrote a bunch of CoffeeScript back in the day, and everyone I&#x27;ve spoken to about it feels the same, that it was a bad idea in hindsight, and a language dead end. The language was only syntactic sugar, and by not bringing anything else to the table, was unconvincing for ports and support in other ecosystems. It now seems that most codebases have been decaffeinated though.
Civet looks like it adds a little more, but the things that aren&#x27;t just syntactic sugar are just a grab bag of TC39 proposals. I&#x27;m a big fan of language proposals in general, and having a language that adds all of them for research purposes seems like a nice thing to have. Haskell did this well with GHC language options. Is this a research language though? It seems not.
What&#x27;s the benefit over Typescript? A few less characters? Faster TC39 proposal integrations? What happens if a proposal is rejected, does it get removed from Civet? What&#x27;s the cost? What happens as Typescript and Civet diverge? What if the TS tooling doesn&#x27;t support Civet features?</span>

                              <span>I worked for an old company that had a lot of old processes and paperwork.  Many bits of paperwork had a &quot;do not write below the line&quot; type areas.  I always wrote something ... nothing ever happened.
I once hand delivered some paperwork (I was running late) to HR rather than using the inter office mail service.  I asked them about it, they told me &quot;Oh you must be Mathew...&quot;  I was HR famous.   They didn&#x27;t actually mind, the company was so process driven that having to visually double check my paperwork was just how things were.
Later on they decided to repaint the entire office because we had slightly changed the colors of our logo.
Not long after painting I jokingly put up a piece of paper on a huge white wall that read &quot;This space intentionally left blank.&quot;   The movers who took down the art put up the art on that wall again, and spaced it evenly ... around my note.
It stayed there for at least 4 years before we left for a new building.

Wouldn&#x27;t another way of saying that be &quot;the Copilot development team is leveraging their Microsoft ownership to create products in a way not available to the general marketplace?&quot;
The goal might not be to squash competition, but blessing one client with special treatment not available to others can still be anti-competitive.
Whether that would fall afoul of any regulation is beyond my expertise. Naively, most companies have internal APIs that are not generally available. But then most companies don&#x27;t have paid public marketplaces on their platform.</span>

                              <span>My personal take, we’ve made the cost of failure to high and cheating too easy.
As a student, the only thing the next institution will see is GPA, school, major. Roughly in that order. If the cost of not getting an A is exclusion from future opportunities- then students will reject exclusion by taking easier classes or cheating.
As someone who studied physics and came out with a 2.7 GPA due to studying what I wanted (the hard classes) and not cheating (as I did what I wanted) - I can say that there are consequences to this approach.
In my opinion, the solution is to reduce the reliance on assessments which are prone to cheating or which in the real world would be done by computer.</span>

                              <span>I’ve been teaching in higher education for 30 years and am soon retiring.  I teach math.  In every math course there is massive amounts of cheating on everything that is graded that is not proctored in a classroom setting.  Locking down browsers and whatnot does not prevent cheating.
The only solution is to require face-to-face proctored exams and not allow students to use technology of any kind while taking the test.  But any teacher doing this will end up with no students signing up for their class. The only solution I see is the Higher Learning Commission mandating this for all classes.
But even requiring in person proctored exams is not the full solution. Students are not used to doing the necessary work to learn.  They are used to doing the necessary work to pass. And that work is increasingly cheating. It’s a clusterfuck.  I have calculus students who don’t know how to work with fractions.  If we did truly devise a system that prevents cheating we’ll see that a very high percentage of current college students are not ready to be truly college educated.
K-12 needs to be changed as well.</span>

Hi! Love what you’ve done with your bear blogs. You’re the first I’ve seen to have one dedicated to photos. 🤯 I’m really curious how you’ve done it — if you’re willing to share via email or, even better, a blog post!
I’ve been looking through some of the docs and I think I’m starting to form the how.
Thanks for considering and for the great posts.
I run 3 main blogs on Bear with two of them being photo related: august morning and Snaps by JCProbably. I didn’t want to immediately assume which one he meant when referring to a photo blog of mine, but my mind did immediately think: Surely he meant august morning because that’s where I spend a lot of my energy on. No one wants to know about Snaps. That site was…</span>

                              <span>Deadnaming a trans person -- calling them by their former name that they have abandoned -- is a way to cause harm. It is well established to be harmful to their mental health.
When you deadname a trans person, the harm is not limited to that instant -- other people who see or hear your use of the incorrect name might start using it themselves, especially if they don&#x27;t know that it is a deadname, thus propagating the harm.
If you deadname a trans person, it is your responsibility to correct the harm. It&#x27;s no one else&#x27;s responsibility. It&#x27;s especially not the responsibility of the trans person you just harmed.
There are many cis people who don&#x27;t think of themselves as bigots, but who will accidentally deadname a trans person and then refuse to correct their harm. This is a specifically trans…</span>

                              <span>A few months ago, I wrote a post about how I wanted to blog less about blogging. I was surprised by the response I got, which was the opposite of what I expected. It seems folks really like reading about blogging, but I still haven&#x27;t written a word about blogging since that post. This changes today, mainly because I failed at keeping my most recent platform swap quiet.
For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been drooling over Robert&#x27;s Bearming theme. Since this blog originated on BearBlog, I never deleted it, and it just remained in a sort of frozen state since April.
On the sly, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Bearming and just toying around with my old posts, and I realized I missed writing in markdown. I also was sick of getting emails from NameCheap regarding my SSL&#x27;s, which was one of the main re…</span>

                              <span>A central use of reserves held at Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) is for the settlement of interbank obligations. These obligations are substantial—the average daily total reserves used on two main settlement systems, Fedwire Funds and Fedwire Securities, exceeds $6.5 trillion. The total amount of reserves needed to efficiently settle these obligations is an active area of debate, especially as the Federal Reserve’s current quantitative tightening (QT) policy seeks to drain reserves from the financial system. To better understand the use of reserves, in this post we examine the intraday flows of reserves over Fedwire Funds and Fedwire Securities and show that the mechanics of each settlement system result in starkly different intraday demands on reserves and differing sensitivities of those intraday demands to the total amount of reserves in the financial system.</span>

                              <span>An old theme within social theory holds that societies with very unequal distributions of wealth can sustain their social cohesion so long as total wealth is growing. Such total growth enables all who get a distributed share of that wealth—even those with the smallest shares—to experience at least some increase. The rich with the biggest shares can grab most of the growth so long as some is provided to those with small shares. The pie analogy works well: so long as the pie is growing all distributed shares of it can also grow. Some will grow more, others less, but all can grow. If all do grow, social stability is facilitated (assuming the society’s population accepts unequal shares). Modern capitalism’s prioritization of economic growth as urgently necessary reflects such social theory (much as economic growth has reinforced it). More

                              <span>Biden’s bombs and missiles, dropped daily on Lebanon, a U.S. ally, by his puppet master Netanyahu, is wreaking havoc in this small defenseless country. The Israeli genocidal machine is waging an incinerating assault on fleeing civilians and critical facilities. The scorched-earth Israeli strategy is the same as what we have seen in Gaza. Attack in Lebanon anyone who moves or anything that stands – whether a hospital, a dense residential area, a café, a municipal building, a market, a school, or a Mosque – and allege there was a Hezbollah commander or a Hezbollah site here or there. Two recent New York Times headlines express some of the impact of this latest Israeli war: “In Just a Week, a Million People in Lebanon Have Been Displaced” and “Lebanon’s Hospitals Buckle Amid an Onslaught: ‘Indiscriminate’ Strikes Overwhelm Health System, U.N. Says.” More

                              <span>It has been a safe assumption for generations that young people tend to be more liberal than their elders. However, in today’s United States, some of the conventional wisdom around age and ideology is being upended. Young women are moving farther to the left than expected while their male peers are disturbingly tending toward conservatism, even in comparison to older men. The reasons behind this cleaving, broadly speaking, stem from the twilight of patriarchy and the failure of capitalism. More

The Methodenstreit: How Economics Forgot History In the late 19th century, economics experienced a deep philosophical debate over methodology, known as the Methodenstreit, or Battle of Methodologies.

                              <span>I like inserting art, like the header to https://simonsarris.com
A village pops up. There is no point to it. You can click to make more houses. You can right-click to drag things around. When I touch it again I think I&#x27;ll add a sun and moon that track the time of day for wherever the user is located. Actually the footer has art too, each page has a semi-randomly assigned illustration from public-domain (old) art that I&#x27;ve found. Like drawings from James McNeill Whistler, for instance. I use his illustrations in &#x27;useful&#x27; websites too.
Actually, I experimented with the sun/moon a few years ago, in this version: https://simonsarris.github.io/simeville/
If you left-click drag the sun downwards, you&#x27;ll see the moon come up. That one is open source, but the code is quite slapdash compared to the new one. Also you have to click ITS TIME TO BUILD to get the buildings.
In general I think websites could be a lot more pretty (gorgeous even), silly, interesting, and a lot less corporate chic than they currently are.</span>

                              <span>Reading this makes me willing to bet that this capital intensive investment boom will be similar to other enormous capital investment booms in US history, such as the laying of the railroads in the 1800s, the proliferation of car companies in the early 1900s, and the telecom fiber boom in the late 1900s. In all of these cases there was an enormous infrastructure (over) build out, followed by a crash where nearly all the companies in the industry ended up in bankruptcy, but then that original infrastructure build out had huge benefits for the economy and society as that infrastructure was &quot;soaked up&quot; in the subsequent years. E.g. think of all the telecom investment and subsequent bankruptcies in the late 90s/early 00s, but then all that dark fiber that was laid was eventually lit up and allowed for the explosion of high quality multimedia growth (e.g. Netflix and the like).
I think that will happen here. I think your average investor who&#x27;s currently paying for all these advanced chips, data centers and energy supplies will walk away sorely disappointed, but this investment will yield huge dividends down the road. Heck, I think the energy investment alone will end up accelerating the switch away from fossil fuels, despite AI often being portrayed as a giant  climate warming energy hog (which I&#x27;m not really disputing, but now that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, I believe this huge, well-funded demand will accelerate the growth of non-carbon energy sources).</span>

                              <span>This post describes my lessons learned after 10 years running production environments in sizes ranging from &quot;just getting started&quot; to a &quot;Series F&quot; company with 4-9 SLAs.
Like any good developer, I&#x27;m impatient and expect tasks to be fast, especially if I need to do them often, like deploying. Nothing is worse than hitting &quot;deploy&quot; and having a 10-15 minute delay before I can validate my changes. It&#x27;s a pain felt by the whole team, multiple times, every day. It breaks their flow. And engineers are expensive, so this lost time and concentration costs a lot of money too.
Let&#x27;s start with the typical setup for my company, analyze what takes the most time, and see how we can strip these layers away to make something that&#x27;s faster and simpler.

That&#x27;s a response I sometimes get when I ask someone if they have a blog. The answer implies that there are certain rules for blogging, such as how often you should write or how long a blog post should be.
But there are no rules other than the ones you set up yourself when it comes to blogging.
If you write one sentence a day for a week, you&#x27;ve created the text you&#x27;re reading right now, complete with a title. So whatever reasons you have for not blogging, don&#x27;t let it be: &quot;I don&#x27;t have time.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m on my second free FSD trial, just started for me today.  Gave it another shot, and it seems largely similar to the last free trial they gave.  Fun party trick, surprisingly good, right up until it&#x27;s not.  A hallmark of AI everywhere, is how great it is and just how abruptly and catastrophically it fails occasionally.
Please, if you&#x27;re going to try it, keep both hands on the wheel and your foot ready for the brake.  When it goes off the rails, it usually does so in surprising ways with little warning and little time to correct.  And since it&#x27;s so good much of the time, you can get lulled into complacence.
I never really understand the comments from people who think it&#x27;s the greatest thing ever and makes their drive less stressful.  Does the opposite for me.  Entertaining but exhausting to supervise.</span>

That leads to generic discussion, which we&#x27;re trying to avoid on HN. Specific discussion of what&#x27;s new or different in an article is a much better basis for interesting conversation.
Since we all have language and opinions about it, the risk of genericness is high with a title like this. It&#x27;s like this with threads about other universal topics too, such as food or health.</span>

The actual paper [1] says that functional MRI (which is measuring which parts of the brain are active by sensing blood flow) indicates that different brain hardware is used for non-language and language functions.
This has been suspected for years, but now there&#x27;s an experimental result.
What this tells us for AI is that we need something else besides LLMs. It&#x27;s not clear what that something else is. But, as the paper mentions, the low-end mammals and the corvids lack language but have some substantial problem-solving capability. That&#x27;s seen down at squirrel and crow size, where the brains are tiny. So if someone figures out to do this, it will probably take less hardware than an LLM.
This is the next big piece we need for AI. No idea how to do this, but it&#x27;s the right question to work on.

                              <span>Lots of people are asking how good the self driving has to be before we tolerate it. I got a one month free trial of FSD and turned it off after two weeks. Quite simply: it&#x27;s dangerous.
- It failed with a cryptic system error while driving
- It started making a left turn far too early that would have scraped the left side of the car on a sign. I had to manually intervene.
- In my opinion, the default setting accelerates way too aggressively. I&#x27;d call myself a fairly aggressive driver and it is too aggressive for my taste.
- It tried to make way too many right turns on red when it wasn&#x27;t safe to. It would creep into the road, almost into the path of oncoming vehicles.
- It didn&#x27;t merge left to make room for vehicles merging onto the highway. The vehicles then tried to cut in. The system should have avoided an unsafe situation like this in the first place.
- It would switch lanes to go faster on the highway, but then missed an exit on at least one occasion because it couldn&#x27;t make it back into the right lane in time. Stupid.
After the system error, I lost all trust in FSD from Tesla. Until I ride in one and feel safe, I can&#x27;t have any faith that this is a reasonable system. Hell, even autopilot does dumb shit on a regular basis. I&#x27;m grateful to be getting a car from another manufacturer this year.</span>

Most recently, I started taking ashwagandha again, since it does tone down my anxiety and feelings so I can actually function. I was having panic attacks every night there for a while - I got over that on my own, but I&#x27;m seeking balance so I can make some life improvements.
I moved my blog(well, set up a new one, technically) from weblog.lol to Bear Blog. Of course, since you&#x27;re reading this, you found it. Still at cropp.blog, as always. The old blog will just remain up as an archive at nicolas.weblog.lol, since I don&#x27;t want to copy it all over by hand, my past blog posts have very little value to me.

Every time he did this route, he would go as fast as possible, pushing himself. He would always finish his ride in about forty-three minutes, red-faced and sweating, totally exhausted.
Then one day, he decided to take it easy. Instead of going all out, he relaxed and enjoyed the view along the way. When he got to the end of the ride, he checked his time, and it was forty-five minutes. Only two minutes slower than when he’d been pushing himself to the max. He couldn’t believe it. Two minutes slower, and he enjoyed the whole ride. He wasn’t tired or drenched in sweat.

 At the end of 2010 an individual act of despair in the town of Sidi Bouzid ignited a daring, enraged, and joyful upheaval that travelled through North Africa into the Middle East and beyond. People defied the oppressive systems they had been immersed in for generations and came together in the streets to topple the political elites at their helm. The authorities, at first stunned by this courageous spirit that they couldn’t understand, then unleashed a cynical and brutal response. 
 This defeat is still being inflicted on the people in the region, and is also felt all over the world by those who stood in solidari…</span>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary drea…</span>

Children’s Oppression, Rights, and Liberation, by Samantha Godwin
Excerpt: academia.edu/2046034/Childrens_Oppression_Rights_and_Liberation (Citations Omitted)
 The legal, political, scientific and media discourse prevalent in previous generations promoted the idea that race and gender are biologically determinate categories with biologically determined attributes, characteristics, and social roles. Historically, many anthropologists and psychologists believed they had found physical evidence that non-white people had an inferior capacity for reason and rationality. These supposed differences fit into an imperialist ideology of a ‘white ma…</span>

 After slaughtering more than 42,000 Palestinians, including 16,500 children, the Israeli military is now invading Lebanon and threatening to go to war with Iran. In the following in-depth account, an anarchist from occupied Palestine reviews the history of Zionist colonialism and Palestinian resistance, makes the case for an anti-colonial understanding of the situation, and explores what it means to act in solidarity with Palestinians.

Young and Oppressed, by Brian Dominick and Sara Zia Ebrahimi
 While most common oppressions, such as sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, even speciesism, have been identified, widely acknowledged, thoroughly discussed and deeply analyzed, one oppression remains largely untouched. This fact is astonishing given that the group oppressed by this ignored injustice is one to which every adult human has once belonged. It is the one oppression with which all humans can identify, having suffered from it directly. It is not an oppression of a tiny minority to which few will ever belong. It is not the oppression of people who can be blamed them…</span>

Why We Can’t Wait, by Adam Fletcher
 “Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor;
 it must be demanded by the oppressed.”
 I look at the people around me
 and see the prisons and traps
 we are all stuck.
 From an early age we are taught and trained:
 sit still, hold on, walk (don’t run),
 and be quiet.
 Whatever you do, be quiet. 
 So we do. We go to polite schools or content jobs.
 We type and read and feel nice.
 Our hair is nice and our hearts are nice.
 We live nice lives. 
 But what if…
 what if we were shown the whole picture
 from the first day?
 What if they said
 “Hey, when you’re poor, you’re screwed.
 If you’re black, …</span>

Documents and Depression, by Kris Anne Bonifacio
 Joaquin Luna’s dream was simple. He wanted to become a civil engineer. But the Texas student’s undocumented status limited his options for the future. Left without hope, the 18-year-old shot himself the day after Thanksgiving last year. In his goodbye letters, Luna expressed despair. In one letter addressed to Jesus Christ, he wrote that he had “no point of existence in this cruel world... I’ve realized that I have no chance in becoming a civil engineer the way I’ve always dreamed of here… so I’m planning on going to you and helping you construct a new temple in heaven.”

Against Parental Rights 
 (Excerpt: academia.edu/19663920/Against_Parental_Rights) 
Samantha Godwin
 There is a significant disjunction between child protectionist theory and rhetoric and the extent of parental powers. The extensive deference to parental preference and discretion seems to have little to do with preserving children’s interests and more to do with parental autonomy. We must conclude that only respect for parental autonomy and freedom, rather than child protection, would lead to the belief that parents ought to be granted rights beyond those narrowly derivable from a child’s interests. This is tr…</span>

The Pedagogy of Religion
Peter Gelderloos
 It was my grandfather’s memorial service, and the Dutch Reform pastor took a break from talking about God and Heaven to the members of the congregation, in which I, as a dutiful grandson, was unfortunately included for the moment, in order to address the children in the audience, the grand-kids and great grand-kids of the deceased, nearly all of them baptized into the Dutch Reform church or a like-minded denomination, as the apple does not fall far from the tree.

Mistrust and Things
Layla AbdelRahim
 Since the 1950s of Soviet Russia, Lena Alexeevna Nikitina and Boris Pavlovich Nikitin, have been sounding alarm that children’s most vicious enemy is, in fact, adults’ mistrust that begins with holding the child when she walks, helping her up when she falls, forbidding her to climb “dangerous” stairs even on the primitive children’s playgrounds marked “for use between 0–3 years old”, picking up the child and sticking her on the slide, constantly telling her what to do or not, what to wear, eat, feel, know, think, and so on, in other words, exercising total control. Mistrus…</span>

I Am
 DAVID: A younger version of myself waits for the bus after school. My friend starts to tell me some of the jokes about “illegals” he knows. I look visibly uncomfortable and he acknowledges it: “You shouldn’t take it personally” he says with a smirk, “I mean, unless you’re ‘illegal.’ “ I freeze and then fumble to change the subject. His reasoning is perfectly sound. Why would I be offended unless I was “illegal”? I take the bus home thinking what a close call that was, and I start to plan how I’ll make it so that this never happens again. I become super-conscious of the potential trajectory of conversatio…</span>

There Is a Better Way
Vicki Larson
 The pressures and pace of modern life has made parents and children stressed and miserable. With the rise of dual-earning families, mothers, and increasingly, fathers are struggling with work-life issues, forcing many to lean in or opt out. But is it truly modern life that’s at fault or is it our expectation that two people – whether hetero or same-sex – can do it alone and do it well? Is the nuclear family all it’s cracked up to be? 
 Despite the belief that monogamous male-female bonding is how mothers and children were supported and thrived, the anthropologist Sarah Blaff…</span>

Adult Education (TED Transcript) 
Adora Svitak
 Now, I want to start with a question: When was the last time you were called “childish”? For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior, or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush. Ask yourself, who’s responsible? Adults. 
 Now, what have kids done? Well, Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account o…</span>

Abstract
 This paper analyses the development of the schism between Marxism and anarchism and explores two distinct methodological approaches to investigating these apparently discrete ideologies: one is derived from analytic political philosophy; the other is an adaptation of Michael Freeden’s conceptual approach. The former views the division between Marxism and anarchism as the result of a clear distinction in universal principles, an account that is found to be flawed. Using the alternative conceptual approach, this paper argues that the schism that marked the rela…</span>

 This article, foremost, is a response to a critique published on my work Against Individualism by a certain Aleph. In short, Aleph is not convinced of my account of the Creative Nothing and is concerned with a “Christian” basis for my mystical methods — among other minutiae. This, he feels, undermines my reading of the apophatic, unsayable Self beyond self, and problematizes my relationship to pagan authors like the divine Plotinus and Porphyry. I will explore all of these in-depth, as I am always one for meaningless chatter. However, t…</span>

Abstract
 In recent years, the discussion about economic concepts different from both capitalism and central planning has gotten more interest, new ideas emerged, and old ideas were rediscovered. This paper presents a modern version of the economic concept of anarcho-communist planning, originating from the late 19th century. The proposed idea is based on the needs of the people while respecting the planetary boundaries. It rejects ideas like markets, work remuneration, and money or other universal units of account. This paper first discusses the shortcomings of markets, central planning, and previous post-capitalist …</span>

Current context
 The current condition of queer communities is paradoxically one of the best and one of the worst we&#x27;ve seen in modern capitalist Western societies. Sixty years of continuous mobilization by the queer movement (and protoqueer before it, if we consider all the developments of the gay and lesbian movements) have led to the legalization and almost total emancipation of our communities within the bourgeois state legal system. We can now, as never before, exist openly within society, putting on our true faces. Yet material violence against…</span>

abstract
 In the early 1960s, a number of anarchist writers showed an interest in cybernetics, in which they saw the tools for better articulating radical forms of self-organisation. Discussions on the connections between anarchism and cybernetics did not advance very far, however, and by the 1970s the topic seems to have fallen off the anarchist radar. With an increase in interest in cybernetics over the last few years, this paper picks up where these debates left off and highlights some …</span>

 “We tend to destroy our leaders with criticism, often personal and vicious.” 
 — Lierre Keith, Deep Green Resistence 
Looting the Corpses That Come Before You
 I’m not here to praise or condemn Caesar, but to make sure he stays buried. Often when a movement falls (and Deep Green Resistance is very much falling) there is a “nostalgic” tendency to attempt to exhume the corpse and at least loot it for a few precious baubles. Part of this necrophilia is the belief that to have persisted or to have attained some notability entails a certain degre…</span>

                              <span>So the end of life for Windows 10 looms ahead of us, which is a problem because Windows 11 has two fundamental problems, as it currently stands:
First, it just won&#x27;t run on the majority of hardware that currently runs Windows 10. This isn&#x27;t just, like, ancient hardware; I have a desktop gaming PC that is perfectly fine to play current-gen AAA games on; it&#x27;s what I played Cyberpunk 2077 on and that was totally okay. But somehow it doesn&#x27;t meet Win11 requirements because of the CPU; it has a Ryzen 5 1600X in it, a CPU from 2017 that is apparently still actively being manufactured.
Moore&#x27;s law has been dead for a while, so the long plateauing of, particularly, CPU power has meant that some of this hardware has a looong shelf life. I still haven&#x27;t run into a game I want to play on PC that is c…</span>

Under normal circumstances I likely would have swallowed my objections and gone, but I&#x27;ve been burning the candle at both ends this week and I have to get up early tomorrow to catch a flight out of EWR.

                              <span>Recently, I began reading Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman. I&#x27;ve been trying to distance myself from self-help/psychology/philosophy books, but I saw someone on reddit make an interesting post regarding some content in the book, so I decided to give it a read.

The book is designed so that you read one micro chapter a day for four weeks. Mr. Burkeman discusses a topic and gives you time to reflect on it. I think this is wise, since in so many situations with books offering advice/guidance, you are so overwhelmed with information that by the end of it you&#x27;re lucky to walk away with one or two nuggets of wisdom.
I reached chapter three recently, and it stuck with me enough to want to write a bit about it. But before I do that, let&#x27;s go back in time, sometime around 1995 in Orlando,…</span>

Common wisdom advocates for using managed k8s and databases, containerized services, horizontal scaling for redundancy, building images in CI/CD, and defining your infrastructure as code. This is Best Practice™, and no one was ever fired for doing that. In fact it&#x27;s quite good for your resumé.
I will argue that such common wisdom is wrong. These tools are complex, and complex infrastructure is a wildly net-negative distraction to your business and inherently risky.
Over the past 10 years I&#x27;ve run services in production with millions of customers, exceeding 4-9&#x27;s uptime. During that time I experimented with a wide variety of architectures, starting…</span>

                              <span>&gt; Skiplagging is not illegal, but airlines view it as a policy violation that is grounds for termination of a traveler’s entire itinerary since the airline can&#x27;t sell the empty seat in the onward flight.
The poor airline, unable to sell an empty seat because ... checks notes ... the seat is already sold to someone, and that person decided not to show up. Truly the horror. Just think of all the revenue the airline lost because they couldn&#x27;t charge more for a shorter flight and now have to fly the last leg with less weight
But it seems like the entire court case was mostly centered around the legality of the branding of the website. I guess overall the guy behind skiplagged will be happy to have gotten away with what amounts to 10% of revenue in exchange for a lot of publicity.</span>

Editor’s note: We think we know what democracy is. But do we? Anthropologist David Graeber burst into national consciousness in 2011 with the Occupy movement he helped to spark. The author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years has written a daring book about democracy in America: its origins, its opponents, and its chances of happening today given the stranglehold of the wealthy on our economic and political systems. Part reflection on Occupy Wall Street, the first major stirring of democratic spirit in the living memory of many, and part journey through the questions and tensio…</span>

This interview between Rachael Kiddey and David Graeber was conducted in 2016 and was originally published in issue X of the ISRF Bulletin. We republish it here in David’s memory.
RACHAEL KIDDEY: Each year, the ISRF team up with a different university to co-produce a workshop. This year we’re working with Professor Charles Stewart from UCL. The theme of the workshop is ‘Discovery &amp; Recognition’. That is, that as social scientists our work constantly surprises us. May I ask for your thoughts on the theme?
 DAVID GRAEBER: Yes. Probably my favourite line in my book Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology—the book that has got me into so much trouble with anthropolo…</span>

 ‘On a deep, cultural level, people actually believe that if you don’t do something that at least mildly frustrates you, then your work is not valuable.’ Anthropologist, activist and bestselling anarchist David Graeber on the police state, bullshit jobs and why people need no telling that capitalism is bad. 
Aro Velmet: When you visited Estonia in 2003 and spoke about the Movement for Global Justice, it was a pretty bleak time for progressives. Only a couple of years had passed since 9/11, the Iraq War was gearing up, and the protests seemed to be failing. But one of the interesting things you noted…</span>

 If you’ve ever spent 15 minutes listening to the same U2 song while on hold to your mobile-phone provider because the 27 people you’ve spoken to so far have no idea who the hell you are, you’ll know all about the throb in the ass that is bureaucracy. Our lives fundamentally suck because of it. 
 David Graeber—the anthropologist who wrote the international best seller Debt: The First 5,000 years (a book Russell Brand says will “make you cleverer”)—argues in his new book, The Utopia of Rules, that we’re trapped in jobs created by the ruling classes to feed into their debt-extraction schemes.

 Recently, Switzerland’s government has agreed to vote on implementing a Basic Income. If it passes, then Switzerland will be one of the first countries to introduce a Basic Income. 
 The Basic Income theory or system has been floating around in many different intellectual circles. Less than a week ago Sam Altman of Y-Combinator wrote an essay on it. And there is a whole subreddit devoted to it. 
 I’m not surprised by its popularity. Most people could really use some extra cash each month, ipso facto a lot of people want the Basic Income.

Not since Dilbert has truth been spoken to power in soulless work settings. But the cartoon character’s successor may be David Graeber. In 2013 he achieved viral fame with cubicle zombies everywhere after he published a short essay on the prevalence of work that had no social or economic reason to exist, which he called “bullshit jobs”. The wide attention seemed to confirm his thesis.
Mr Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, has expanded on the ideas in a recent book. He responded to five questions from The Economist’s Open Future initiative. He rails against “feudal retinues of basically useless flunkies.” …</span>

 “As the global Covid-19 pandemic is upon us, a number of mutual aid groups have started forming across the country. (...) It is estimated that 2–3 people out of a hundred [infected by Covid] will die. We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening. (...) The Tory government…</span>

A few years ago David Graeber’s mother had a series of strokes. Social workers advised him that, in order to pay for the home care she needed, he should apply for Medicaid, the US government health insurance programme for people on low incomes. So he did, only to be sucked into a vortex of form filling and humiliation familiar to anyone who’s ever been embroiled in bureaucratic procedures.

READING:
A few years ago i started reading Saga, the comic written by  Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by the talented Fiona Staples. Not quite sure why I stopped reading it but decided to pick it up again. I bought the box set Vol 1-9! And it arrived today so i&#x27;m v excited to jump back into this world.

Saga Vol. 1
WATCHING:
Only Murders in the Building. I adore this show and so glad it&#x27;s back on. Can I please live in a fancy building like this and befriend a couple of peculiar yet distinguished fellows, but instead of solving murders, we just make zines and talk books?

I need this Snoopy sweatshirt in my life. Idk, but lately, I&#x27;ve been nostalgic for cutesy childhood things for comfort.
Been enjoying reading  Morning Music these days. I like their concept of sharing what they&#x27;re listening to over morning coffee.
These tiny handmade dolls by myrtlemakes are so precious! I&#x27;m inspired to make little things like this. New hobby, perhaps?</span>

                              <span>As central banks shrink their balance sheets to restore price stability and phase out expansionary programs, gauging the ampleness of reserves has become a central topic to policymakers and academics alike. The reason is that the ampleness of reserves informs when to slow and then stop quantitative tightening (QT). The Federal Reserve, for example, implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough such that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in short-term rates. The goal is therefore to implement QT while ensuring that reserves remain sufficiently ample. In this post, we review how to gauge the ampleness of reserves using the new Reserve Demand Elasticity (RDE) measure, which will be published monthly on the public website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a standalone product.</span>
