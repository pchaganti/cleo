                              <span>I take inspiration from everything and everyone.
People- First of all, I don&#x27;t know if I would be writing this without my brother, Arun. He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I&#x27;ve learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.
The war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I&#x27;ve read not because of it&#x27;s writing but because if it&#x27;s relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.
Brandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It&#x27;s such a perfect series. Then there&#x27;s the Stormlight Archive and it&#x27;s huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).
Haikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It&#x27;s about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.
It just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it&#x27;s all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.
Naval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you&#x27;ve been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He&#x27;s everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.</span>

                              <span>Israel’s history over the past 76 years is replete with examples of deceit.  This was true from the start, when the Israelis denied their role in expelling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes during Israel’s War of Independence.  The Arab world refers to the expulsion as the “nakba” (the catastrophe), which is largely denied in Israel.  The Israeli legacy of denying the “nakba” is no different from those who deny the Holocaust.

An egregious hack and one-man state-controlled news outlet, Krauthammer ceaselessly churned out bilge throughout his career, with a heavy focus on “America’s special role” in the world, its superficially similar but somehow entirely distinctive  “special place” in the world, and the “special responsibility” the United States must carry on its shoulders as a result.

This retreat from holding power accountable not only discredits the pursuit of truth in the service of justice and the strengthening of democracy but also tends to fall prey to the seductions of corruption, political theater and entertainment.

                              <span>Hi,
I don&#x27;t know... Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I&#x27;ve already failed?), seriously.
I&#x27;m a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I&#x27;m failing more.
I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I coul…</span>

                              <span>bearblog.dev allows for open discussion and exchange of ideas in a low-stakes way. Putting my thoughts into writing on Bear means there are chances that some readers may open it and engage with it. At that moment, they are actively interpreting and making sense of it based on their own background. I find it liberating to release my raw text entries into the world and see what resonates or sparks new internal discussions for others. There is also a sense of relief in getting ideas that have been swirling in my mind out in the open. Once published, it feels like a task completed. While I don&#x27;t necessarily stay involved in conversations about my posts, I appreciate seeing the ripple effects as others reflect on or debate the topics.</span>

I&#x27;m surprised that someone had trouble serving a subpoena on Facebook.
Looking up &quot;Meta&quot; in California Corporation Search brings up everything with &quot;Metal&quot; in it, which is a hassle. Their actual company name is &quot;Meta Platforms, Incorporated&quot;. Search for &quot;Meta Platforms&quot; here.[1] California company registration #2711108.
Subpoenas are sent, using a process server, to their registered agent,
which is Corporation Service Company in Sacramento, a business which exists to receive subpoenas for other companies. And, conveniently, there are process serving companies with offices in the same building, and you can find them by searching for the address of CSC and &quot;process server&quot;, then ignoring the spam results.
Most small claims court web sites explain all this.

If those in power decide to push forward by increasing the penalties, eventually running a Mastodon server will become as risky as getting caught for murder. At that point, it would be naive to run a Mastodon server locally, wouldn&#x27;t it?
P.S. Mind you, the average consumer/user doesn&#x27;t care as long as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are up and running. Quotes like &quot;they already know everything&quot; and &quot;do you have something to hide from the government?&quot; will become ubiquitous in public discourse.</span>

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

                              <span>Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are growing, but banks support that growth via funding and liquidity insurance. The transformation of activities and risks from banks to a bank-NBFI nexus may have benefits in normal states of the world, as it may result in overall growth in (especially, credit) markets and widen access to a wide range of financial services, but the system may be disproportionately exposed to financial and economic instability when aggregate tail risk materializes. In this post, we consider the systemic implications of the observed build-up of bank-NBFI connections associated with the growth of NBFIs.</span>

                              <span>I understand the concern that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that will escape its bounds and threaten humanity. That is a risk.
My bigger, and more pressing worry, is that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that does not escape its bounds, and the question will be which humans control it. Look no further than history to see what happens when humans acquire great power. The &quot;cold war&quot; nuclear arms race, which brought the world to the brink of (at least partial) annihilation, is a good recent example.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? -- That is my biggest concern.
Update: I&#x27;m not as worried about Ilya et al as commercial companies (including formerly &quot;open&quot; OpenAI) discovering AGI.</span>

1. It gets added to a list of marketing website leads, which is owned by SDRs/BDRs who are there to filter and qualify leads. These are usually early-career people, with a base salary + quota for qualifying leads. The website is many times their least preferred channel of leads due to the quality, but they can&#x27;t ignore it because sometimes good customers do come through there.
2. The SDR will either work over email or on a call; their goal is to identify if you&#x27;re a real potential customer (vs shopping for prices, vs confused about what we sell), write up notes, and identify which customer segment you belo…</span>

                              <span>Maybe they have saved enough from working in tech that they can grow vegetables for themselves in a very low scale way. Its nice to escape from the career you&#x27;ve had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you&#x27;ve lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn&#x27;t that difficult. You certainly don&#x27;t need &quot;millions in equipment&quot;. Its exactly what I did.
I found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much &#x27;smaller&#x27; scale. My company is small and work demands don&#x27;t dominate my life. I have balance.
This year I&#x27;ve planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. &quot;touching grass&quot; is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens.</span>

If you&#x27;ve never worked on a farm and have some kind of romantic idea about it then you shouldn&#x27;t do this. Farming is hard work. Modern farmers have college degrees, millions in equipment, and a vast amount of knowledge and experience you do not have.
If you&#x27;re thinking of doing this and do not have experience go work on a farm for a year before you buy in.</span>

                              <span>Would I trust an OS which states &quot;Why don’t you use GCC? – Because GCC is a crap.&quot; in the project&#x27;s FAQ [1]? This isn&#x27;t really inspiring confidence.
Also, it&#x27;s completely not obvious from your web pages which features already work in your OS. And, IMHO, Discord is definitely not &quot;the perfect place to connect, collaborate, and contribute&quot;.

                              <span>I like a lot of the answers, but something else I&#x27;d add: lots of &quot;popular&quot; architectures from the late 00s and early 2010s have fallen by the wayside because people realized &quot;You&#x27;re not Google. Your company will never be Google.&quot;
That is, there was a big desire around that time period to &quot;build it how the big successful companies built it.&quot; But since then, a lot of us have realized that complexity isn&#x27;t necessary for 99% of companies. When you couple that with hardware and standard databases getting much better, there are just fewer and fewer companies who need all of these &quot;scalability tricks&quot;.
My bar for &quot;Is there a reason we can&#x27;t just do this all in Postgres?&quot; is much, much higher than it was a decade ago.</span>

supreme, powering some of the most complex and dynamic applications across the globe. Behind the
scenes, a network of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) drives Kubernetes&#x27; innovation and stability.

                              <span>On my way home from work, I realized that something must have happened. The closer I got to home, the later the arrival time showed on the map app. It turned out to be a serious traffic accident involving a truck.
An hour later, after I had parked my car and started to walk home, the sky immediately opened up. It came down like the rainy season in Asia, causing everyone to run for cover.
In a way, it was a nice little break. A moment of reflection. I started to think about the changes in life...
How quickly a moment can change completely. Well, I was lucky to be hit by rain and not a car, but it could have been me in one of those vehicles.
As I finished the last job of the day, I decided to wait to go home to prepare for tomorrow&#x27;s job. Who knows, maybe those minutes were life-changing for me. I will never know.
It doesn&#x27;t hurt to remind ourselves from time to time of the changes in life, its fragility and unpredictability. Not in a resigned way, but in gratitude for what we have.</span>

                              <span>Quiet Sunday (6/16) stroll in downtown Richmond this past weekend.
I&#x27;ve always loved the vintage aesthetic, but have been more drawn to it recently. Been loving this little area in the MOM &amp; POP art shop in downtown Point Richmond (CA). We&#x27;ve gotten a few pins and a record (or 2) here in the past.
Here are some of my favorite snapshots...





And then some more finds around the area...
In case you didn&#x27;t know, I have a thing for photographing old school pay phones.


I also really happen to love typewriters.

A photo series is never complete without a quick snap of Cocoa.</span>

 In issue 215 of Black Flag we ran a critique of the politics of Green Anarchist, “Irrationalism — Steve Booth Against the Machine”, which attacked propositions by Steve Booth (in Green Anarchist 51) in favour of “acts of intense violence against the system with no obvious motives, no pattern”. Booth stated that:

Title: My Own Pearl Harbor
Date: Dec 7, 2022
Source: medium.com/@danielmcgowannyc

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning. And like that, the past had caught up with…</span>

 The award-winning documentary, If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front, premiered at Sundance last spring and continues to screen in theaters across the globe. The film, which aired on PBS earlier this fall and is now available on DVD, details the events that led to the imprisonment of environmental activist Daniel McGowan and raises critical questions about ecological crisis, terrorism, and government repression of political activists. 
 Those who see If A Tree Falls are likely to be left with a number of lingering questions. How is Daniel doing now? When will he be re…</span>

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides.

 The Houthis attacks on cargo ships, the USA/UK strikes against Yemen, the USA/EU naval fleet deployed in the Red Sea, the ISIS-K Crocus City Hall attack[1], the Iran/Israel missile attacks[2] constitute new expressions of the emerging global reality: competing groups/blocks of capitalists have chosen the route of war, in order to establish themselves in a better position within the hierarchies of a globalised economy that is in stagnation, and is also dealing with the exhausti…</span>

Nos piden desde el principio un régimen perfecto, garantía de que las cosas se harán así y no de este otro modo, sin coscorrones, sin tanteos. Si hubiéramos de aprender a vivirlo, no terminaríamos nunca el aprendizaje. Ni el niño aprendería a andar, ni el chico montaría en bicicleta, ni sería posible adquirir un oficio o una especialización. Al contrario, en la vida se hacen al revés las cosas.

Title: On Eugene O’Neill’s “Philosophical Anarchism”
Date: 2007
Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. 

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…</span>

Even if this funding is only sufficient to review a handful of papers each year, it stands to have a transformative effect on the level of hype and p-hacking in many fields, and could nearly eliminate the rare cases of actual fraud. It would also improve the overall quality and reliability of the literature too.</span>

If the creators read this, I suggest some ways of building trust. There’s no “about us”, no GitHub link, etc. It’s a random webpage that wants my personal details, and sends me a “exe”.

                              <span>Visited a new cafe. A very cozy place. The aroma made it impossible to resist getting something good to go with the coffee.
The walls were decorated with plants and art. One of the pictures caught my eye. It said:
Always be a little kinder than necessary.
Wise words! And so simple. A free gesture that can brighten someone&#x27;s day.
A little smile. A thumbs up. A &quot;tell the chef the food was delicious&quot;.
We don&#x27;t need to exaggerate. We don&#x27;t have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.
But we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.
If we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.

                              <span>In our previous post, we documented the significant growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) over the past decade, but also argued for and showed evidence of NBFIs’ dependence on banks for funding and liquidity support. In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.</span>

Title: On Organization

Notes: Translated from the Italian-language article in ‘L’Adunata dei Refrattari’, June 19, 1954, New York City and Newark. A partial English translation previously appeared in ‘Resistance: An Anarchist Bi-Monthly‘, August-October 1954, New York City, but this is a new and complete translation

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…</span>

Title: The Armed Nation
Date: 1902
Notes: Translated by Andrea Asali, from “‘La nazione armata,’” La Rivoluzione Sociale (London), no. 4 (November 15, 1902), published in ‘The Complete Works of Malatesta, Vol. V, The Armed Strike: The Long London Exile of 1900–13′ (2023), edited by Davide Turcato, who notes that &quot;In the debate on how the army should be structured, a debate that has accompanied the history of unified Italy, the &#x27;armed nation&#x27; was the model that federalist and democratic forces opposed to that of the permanent army at the sovereign’s service. Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…</span>

Ryan&#x27;s work is legitimately interesting and novel &quot;LLM reasoning&quot; research! The core idea:
&gt; get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s)
Roughly, he&#x27;s implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we&#x27;d love to see more of.
A couple important notes:
1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).
2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn&#x27;t been validated or scrutinized yet.
All said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We&#x27;ll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard
EDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this</span>

this isn&#x27;t much of a feature upgrade, but we took the opportunity to clean up a few things and drop IE support, which will help us slim down the library over time
hopefully it&#x27;s an easy upgrade for most htmx users, upgrade guide is here:

                              <span>It&#x27;s weird to watch Adobe make these fundamentally short sighted decisions. I can only assume the ultimate cause is the individual motivations of executives and managers. &quot;Oooo, if we raise subscriptions $10/mo, we&#x27;ll make lots of money, and it&#x27;ll look really good on my annual review.&quot; &quot;Oooo, this cancellation fee will really help our retention, which will look really good on my annual review.&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop subscription only will do amazing things for our revenue.&quot;
When you have complete market dominance, you have little opportunity for growth. If your employees and investors have an insatiable need for growth, you have to try anyway, and that&#x27;s where things fall apart. The #1 threat to your magical money faucet is something replacing your product as the photo editor of choice, and you should be 100% focused on making sure that doesn&#x27;t happen. To do that, you need to be focused on keeping up quality, periodically adding the latest features, and making absolutely sure that the next generation of artists is coming up using your tool.
That Adobe rep 25 years ago was 100% correct, but &quot;I keep the money pipe flowing and did not actively make it worse&quot; does not get you a promotion.</span>

                              <span>I remember doing laser cooling of rubidium atoms in physics class. It&#x27;s really cool how it works:
* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.
* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn&#x27;t affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.
Rubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.</span>

This is the entire issue with these kinds of things.  They always launch at a good value because they know they can capture the market.  Yes if they were benevolent or whatever it&#x27;d be fine, but these things almost ALWAYS turn into cluster fucks.
They couldn&#x27;t launch at worse value than the current product line because they need full adoption before they can put the screws to you.</span>

Fast forward a decade and that $19.99/mo product has become $89.99/mo and the value prop has plummeted on top of it. The big difference today is that instead of people returning to the high seas and continuing to use adobe software, they are just moving to different ecosystems -- procreate, davinci, foxit, etc.</span>

                              <span>About 25 years ago, working at one of those dot com bubble internet consultancy firms, I was told by an Adobe rep that they knew everyone at home had a pirated copy of their software but the company view was that they thought that was a good thing. It meant people learnt their software at home and then insisted on using it at work, where it would be a paid for license.
It seems their attitudes changed soon after, perhaps due to their almost total market dominance, and they became aggressive towards their users in the pursuit of profits. The last Adobe software I really used was Lightroom as that was one of the last pay-once software titles. Now the only Adobe product most of us at work have is except Acrobat Reader. We were quite glad when the Figma purchase failed.</span>

                              <span>“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they&#x27;re working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.

                              <span>Because the Bantu languages (most prominently: Swahili) and Japanese have similar sound systems.   Finnish is also oddly similar-sounding, or Hawaiian.  None of them are actually related.
It&#x27;s because the syllable is restricted in the number of possible forms, in a similar way.  (And they all have approximately five vowels.  And a pitch accent.)  In Hawaiian, nothing but consonant + vowel syllables are possible.  Swahili and Japanese allow an optional final n sound.  Finnish is a little more flexible, and syllables can end with an n, r, l or t.  No consonant clusters, in any of the languages.  No syllables ending with consonants outside the restricted set (if any), in any of the languages.
This results in a lot of syllables of the form: i, a, ne, na, ka, ta, po, to...  &quot;Pokatokaino&quot;.  I just made that up and it&#x27;s probably not a Swahili, Finnish, Hawaiian, or Japanese word -- but it could be.
This basic pattern (consonant + vowel + maybe limited option for final consonant) is very common; it&#x27;s the most common arrangement among the worlds languages.   Far more common than languages like English which allow monstrosities like &quot;strengths&quot; (which is 6 consonants and one vowel).</span>

                              <span>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that there was a decent size, but small market for SBCs for low-volume embedded work (including hobbyists) before Raspberry Pi. You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.
Broadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.
5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).</span>

                              <span>&gt; Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.
What&#x27;s always been funny to me about the scientific approach to animal consciousness/emotions/empathy is that in a perfectly rational world the default assumption would be that animals and humans exist along a spectrum and there isn&#x27;t a sharp cliff where humans are 100% conscious and empathetic but dogs are 0%. The claim that humans are categorically different than other animals is the extraordinary one, not the claim that we are made of mostly the same stuff.
The only reason why animal consciousness has been controversial historically is a religious one—the Bible has typically been read as placing humanity in a category of its own. And yet we see countless secular scientists clinging to that perspective when even a cursory glance at the evidence and a basic application of Occam&#x27;s razor would suggest the opposite.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s because RaspberryPis are no longer cheap throw away computers meant for education or hobbyists, they&#x27;re developer kits for manufacturers that need a CPU running a well supported mainline Linux in their products.
The only reason they don&#x27;t cost $500 or more is because the foundation needs the hobbyist market to write and support the open source BSP, without which the RPi would be just another poorly supported also-ran in an already crowded market. With how well supported mainline Linux is on the Pi, EEs would be willing to pay a lot more.</span>

I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
