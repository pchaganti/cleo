1. Introduction
 Mahayana Buddhism divides human history into three ages: the Age of the Right Dharma (shōbō), which occurred in the first 500 years after the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, where enlightenment was fully possible and the Buddha’s teachings were maintained; the Era of Semblance Dharma (zōhō), the 500 years following the shōbō era, where the Buddhist teachings and practice still existed but were deteriorated and lacked confirmed enlightenment; and finally, the Dharma-Ending Age (mappō), in which gradually all teachings bequeathed by the Buddha wi…</span>

Introduction
 Making the shift to the consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that we can do to build a democratic society. Consensus can give us the power we need to focus our society’s attention on improving education, making peace, providing universal healthcare and creating the world we desire. 
 Consensus creates true democracy—not the democracy in name only that sickens any aware person. Consensus empowers all who participate in it. In-name-only democracy disempowers all who participate in it (who dutifully trudge to the polls every few years to select new masters). True democracy might be a large part of the solution to …</span>

 Once considered the cool, edgy version of polyamory, a sort of polyam++, relationship anarchy is increasingly coming under scrutiny because it is being used to justify a specific kind of harmful behavior in relationships. 
 This behavior is probably best described in blunt terms: (mostly) cis guys are fucking around with (mostly) femmes, and disconnecting from them the moment there’s any mention of romantic feelings, hopes for a more ent…</span>

Abstract
 This paper proposes new perspectives on anarchism, indigeneity, and Afro-descendent struggles, by discussing the case of Brazilian anarchists’ commitment to luta afroindígena. They mean by this term the intersection of indigenous and Afro-descendant resistances for the recognition of land, against the violence of states, agribusiness, and extractivism. I argue that this case offers key insights to radical geographies, and to the broader field of decolonial scholarship, to challenge cultural and racial essentialisms by connecting different militant traditions. I also argue t…</span>

                              <span>Friday again. The weeks have been absolutely flying by! I find myself more than a little disoriented by the internal flash of light and color as June hurtles into July. And now I have to meet with the fact that we&#x27;re halfway through the year &amp; I only have so much to show for it.
Here is where I might usually lay into all of the ways I&#x27;ve fucked up my goals and plans for this year...but I don&#x27;t feel like doing that right now!
I&#x27;m in a really good mood. So I wanna talk about what I feel like I&#x27;ve actually done a good job of this year!!!
Okay! Number one: I&#x27;ve been so social! This is probably the most social-butterfly version of myself I&#x27;ve managed to muster up in years. Maybe not so much throughout this month in particular, but I&#x27;ve been recharging from all of the events, reconnections, and …</span>

                              <span>Don’t jump straight in. Observe and see how people are moving before you get involved.
Look out for each other. If someone falls over, help them get up. You are there to have fun together.
Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience. Stay on the outside until you get your bearings. Then, when you’re ready, venture further into the center to get really wild.
Never try and intentionally hurt someone. If you get hit by accident or intentionally do not retaliate.
Treat everyone with respect and stay safe!

                              <span>Congress can actually legislate the right of agencies to interpret the gaps in the laws back into effect - by passing a law that explicitly gives agencies this power.
Just like congress can legislate abortion laws rather than leaving it to judicial precedence.
Fundamentally there’s nothing wrong with the position of supreme court to push the responsibility of lawmaking back on congress.</span>

                              <span>AOL&#x27;s server code was excellent. It was written by some people that had done similar things for BITNET and had a deep understanding of Unix programming and how to use event loops for scalability.
It was in C, but the process was expected to run for months without crashing or running out of memory; if it had an abnormal exit, you&#x27;d (the owner as set in some code thing) get an email with the core backtrace. If it had a memory leak, ops would be on you quickly. Ops was considered a primary driver of requirements to dev, and absolutely everything could be reloaded into a running server without restarting it. There was a TCP control port where a TCL interpreter inside the service was exposed and generally you wrote the (very simple, CS 101 style) TCL commands to manage the server.

* Creating a mutable snapshot of the entire codebase takes a second or two.
* Builds are perfectly reproducible, and happen on build clusters. Entire C++ servers with hundreds of thousands of lines of code can be built from scratch in a minute or two tops.
* The build config language is really simple and concise.
* Code search across the entire codebase is instant.
* File history loads in an instant.
* Line-by-line blame loads in a few seconds.
* Nearly all files in supported languages have instant symbol lookup.
* There&#x27;s a consistent style enforced by a shared culture, auto-linters, and presubmits.
* Shortcuts for deep-linking to a file/version/line make sharing code easy-peasy.
* A ton of presubmit checks ensure uniform code/test quality.
* Code reviews are required, and so is pairing tests with code changes.</span>

                              <span>From Justice Kagan&#x27;s dissent on page 82:
&gt; This Court has long understood Chevron deference to reflect what Congress would want, and so to be rooted in a presumption of legislative intent. Congress knows that it does not—in fact cannot—write perfectly complete regulatory statutes...
&gt; It knows that those statutes will inevitably contain ambiguities that some other actor will have to resolve, and gaps that some other actor will have to fill. And it would usually prefer that actor to be the responsible agency, not a court...
&gt; Put all that together and deference to the agency is the almost obvious choice, based on an implicit congressional delegation of interpretive authority. We defer, the Court has explained, “because of a presumption that Congress” would have “desired the agency (rather than the courts)” to exercise “whatever degree of discretion” the statute allows. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517
U. S. 735, 740–741 (1996).
&gt; Today, the Court flips the script: It is now “the courts (rather than the agency)” that will wield power when Congress has left an area of interpretive discretion. A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris. In recent years, this Court has too often taken for itself decision-making authority Congress assigned to agencies. The Court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; its own judgment on climate change for that of the Environmental Protection Agency; and its own judgment on student loans for that of the Department of Education.</span>

                              <span>The one in my previous job, which was an admin board for a market intelligence application. Ultimately, the reason it was good was because the engineers had zero ego on top of having excellent skills. The team that set the codebase were basically 4 seniors and 3 principals (the client actually did pay for top talent in this case) so not only everything was based on industry standards, written elegantly and organized perfectly, but every time some new requirement came up, these senior / principal engineers would discuss it in the most civilized matter I have ever seen.
E.g, &quot;we need to come up with a way to implement X&quot;. Person A gives their idea, person B gives another idea and so on until everybody shared their thoughts. Then someone would say &quot;I think what person C said makes the most sense&quot; and everybody would agree and that was it. 30 minutes to hear everybody out, 3 minutes to discuss who will do it and when and the meeting was over.

Felicia Gayle’s murderer left behind footprints in her blood, fingerprints, hair, and, most crucially, DNA on the knife used to kill her. The problem was: none of the evidence implicated the person the DA charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the crime. More

                              <span>My understanding is this allergen over-labeling was inspired by the FDA in the first place. https://www.fastcompany.com/90830854/sesame-seed-allergen-fd...
From the linked article (from Jan 2023):
  But sesame does differ in one distinct way from eggs, peanuts, shellfish, milk, and soy: The seeds are teeny tiny and hard to keep track of. This means they’re prone to “cross-contamination,” in food-allergy terms. If you operate a bakery that makes sesame bagels, the odds are decent that rogue seeds will end up in your other products, too. Bad news for people with severe sesame allergies. But it’s also expensive and frustrating for food manufacturers to ensure the seeds are kept away from other foods, if they’re on the FDA’s major allergens list.
  
  Advocates have therefore been warning since December that the FASTER Act is poised to have a counter effect. Rather than minimize cross-contamination, as they argue the law requires, many big food brands have opted to add sesame to their bread products, then simply declare it as an ingredient. They are intentionally adding sesame flour to “avoid complying with the spirit and intent of the FASTER Act,” FARE tells Fast Company. That is cheaper than certifying that their facilities are 100% sesame-free.</span>

                              <span>I think there&#x27;s a misunderstanding in what the settlement is about. As part of Purdue&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Sackler family is voluntarily providing 6 billion dollars to help settle claims opioid victims have brought against Purdue Pharma.
As a condition to provide the 6 billion dollars, the Sackler family has asked the bankruptcy judge to not even allow any new suits against the Sacklers related to the Opioid epidemic. This is something bankruptcy courts do regular for the company Purdue Pharma, but it is irregular when it comes to the Sackler family (this is not the entity going bankrupt!)
This is the issue that went up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled that the protection given to the Sackler family is not something that can be given  by a bankruptcy judge during the bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma.
Matt Levine has a much better explanation here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-06-27/purdue...</span>

                              <span>Wow, this is sad news indeed for the world at large, but also me personally.  I&#x27;m suddenly in deep regret for having procrastinated reaching out the thank him.  He doesn&#x27;t know this, but he was somewhat of a mentor for me.
In the early 00s I bought a laptop that had an RTL 8188 CE card in it that ran awful under Linux.  I forked his driver and made a number of changes to it and eventually got my wifi working really well (by doing things that could never be upstreamed due to legal/regulatory restrictions).  Over the years I rebased often and reviewed the changes, and learned a lot from watching his code.  It took a bit of getting used to, but a certain amount of beauty and appreciation emerged.  One thing was very clear:  This man was doing a lot of the work to keep the ship together.  Even just keeping the driver compilable with each kernel release often took some non-trivial refactoring, which he did reliably and well.
Larry, you will be missed my friend.  RIP.
If you are waiting to reach out to somebody, don&#x27;t wait too long or it may suddenly be too late.  The years can slip by in a flash.</span>

                              <span>While this author is of a younger generation, this really resonated with me as a Gen Xer. I feel there is so much disillusionment among folks that came of age during the 90s because there was so much techno optimism then, and it didn&#x27;t quite turn out like we envisioned. Two things made me think about this recently:
1. I saw a Reddit post that was titled something like &quot;The 90s were peak humanity. Enough tech to make life comfortable, but not so much that it had totally taken over the focus.&quot; It was a video of a packed mall around the holidays filled with generally happy people socializing in public.
2. That viral quote that was making the rounds, &quot;I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.&quot;
I just feel there has been a growing chasm over the past 25 years where tech is no longer solving pressing human problems (generally, obviously not true in all areas e.g. decarbonization tech) but is more concerned with just rent-seeking value extraction.</span>

Title: Anarchist solidarity with the people of Ukraine
Date: 25 February 2024

 On February 24, hundreds of anarchists in several cities across Europe took to the streets in solidarity with the people of Ukraine on the second anniversary of the start of full-scale Russian invasion. The Anarchist Bloc was at actions in Warsaw, Vilnius, Berlin, Tbilisi, Vienna and Zurich. It was important for us to express words of support to people from Ukraine, whose country has been tormented by the Kremlin’s aggression for two years, to applaud the steadfastness of all those who oppose this aggression with weapons in their hands, especially our comrades.

 As it became known from a propaganda video on youtube published by the state media, anarchists from the group “Black Nightingales” were detained in Belarus several months ago. According to the regime’s version, they were planning to attack the state infrastructure and sabotage the support of the Russian military in Belarus. The list of the group members includes Maria Misyuk, Trofim Barysau, Sergey Zhigalyou, Dmitry Zahoroshko, Anastasia Klimenka, and Aleksandra Pulinovich. Based on the attitude of the Belarusian regime towards anarchists, we believe that any recorded testimony was obtained under torture until the co…</span>

 No one doubted the ability of Vladimir Putin and his cohort to draw a 50%+ figure to maintain their own power. It would be naive to believe that any action in the controlled environment of the polling stations could affect the percentages displayed on the screens of the Russian empire and the entire planet. Whether you spoil a ballot, write a message on it, or nuke a polling station, Putin will still consistently win. 
 Smart voting, apps on phones and even prayers will not be able to influence the results of the vote.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in a writing slump lately. I&#x27;ve been going out (a little bit) and doing things and even posting some pictures to keep the Publish button warm. But the voice in my head has been awfully quiet, so today I&#x27;m going to sit here and coax him out.
Last week my dad flew to New Jersey for a business trip and did me a favor by bringing a bag of my clothes with him, so I took the train over to Newark (EWR) to meet him and pick up my stuff. While waiting for him I killed some time riding in the airport Airtrain that whisks you from one terminal to another. The Airtrain is so strange. The train cars are absurdly small — I&#x27;m used to them being subway sized — and fit probably no more than 10 people each. I spent a few minutes alone in my tiny metal capsule and did not pass up the opportunity to…</span>

                              <span>Hi 👋  I’m JC (Probably)
But you can call me Jedda.
🚧 This page is a work in progress, but I too, am always a work in progress, so I think it all works out.
Based in the Bay Area (CA), but originally from the East Coast. I’m a Product Manager by profession, photography hobbyist, avid reader, and a creative by nature. I have a 12-year old dachshund named Cocoa (Chanel), who pretty much runs my life.
I’m not great at writing (or talking) about myself. If you stick around, little bits and pieces of my life do surface itself in the things I create and write.
This blog doesn’t have a specific theme. It’s mostly anything and everything that pops into my head. It was initially started as a place for quick notes, that turned into long form thoughts, but now is just an overall place for my primarily text-based everything.
I’d love to hear from you, even if it’s just to say hello. I’m typically available on socials such as 🐘Mastodon but can easily be reached via email through my Letterbird (or the email embedded in my posts). If you’d like to subscribe via RSS, you can do so 📡 here.
Welcome to my Notes. I am so glad you&#x27;re here.</span>

                              <span>New York City&#x27;s cultural and demographic landscape is wide and deep; today we focus on the narrative of the Chinese Diaspora in New York which offers a compelling study in migration, community dynamics, and urban development.
At the heart of this narrative lies the transformation of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, a neighborhood once bustling with the vibrant intricacies of Chinese culture, now a shadow of its former self, restaurants dwindling, residents leaving, and culture evaporating. The assertion that Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has succumbed to the relentless march of urban evolution is not just an observation; it&#x27;s a stark reality. The exodus, driven by the prohibitive costs of Manhattan living, has rerouted the lifeblood of this community to Flushing, at the end of the Queens-bound 7 line, marki…</span>

It&#x27;s May 8th, 2022 and the market has officially left &quot;easy-mode&quot; and entered into a straight grind down. Gone are the days of just buying $NIO at the end of the day because it closed up at least 1 ATR on elevated rvol and you&#x27;ll wake up with it a couple points higher, just cause!
Now, we are seeing the high flyers that are up in the air getting hit on earnings and selling off aggressively. The r*tarded trade that Tim and I are taking in our joint account is shorting earnings day 1 under premarket lows and it&#x27;s working! We aren&#x27;t crushing it, but it&#x27;s working. We are covering everything at 1:1, often reshorting into vwap vs high of day and taking them overnight. Additionally, w…</span>

Preface (2004)
 This document was originally drafted by members of the Anarchist Workers’ Association, (A.W.A.) following a resolution passed at the 1976 [?] A.W.A. conference, which called for the A.W.A. to agree a clearer definition of its theory and strategy. At that time the A.W.A. had groups and members in England and Scotland, and a sympathiser or two in Ireland, and published the monthly newspaper ‘Anarchist Worker’. The text below was adopted as a ‘provisional’ rather than as a definitive text by the tendency whose members went on to publish ‘Libertarian Communist’, and renamed t…</span>

                              <span>I found this blog site a few weeks back. I have a very hectic schedule at the moment and don’t have too much time for writing.
But I do seem to have time for browsing what others write while I wait on the mundane waits in life, which normally translates to waiting in a line, waiting in a waiting room (probably the most obviously named room in the english language)  or waiting for the dog to stop sniffing around and pee.
In these little moments, the phone comes out and I look at the recent posts. I’m fascinated by what you write. The honesty, the freeform, the choice of blog styles, the navigation tabs (I’m really happy with the “nope” and will be adding one soon), all of it.
I’m just really glad to be here. And I want to thank you all for your contributions. You make my world brighter.
And for those of you that think “no one will see this”. You are wrong. Someone will.
So keep writing please!</span>

While the following may sound annoyingly prestige-oriented, and compensation-driven, it is bluntly intended to reflect the realities of an increasingly competitive professional landscape. There is a lot of yapping, beware. Get some Tsaocaa boba and settle in.
About me, for context, I grew up low-income in a suburban town with immigrant parents that never attended high school. I took up to Calc AB in high school, and I only knew basic web development coming into CMU. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University this semester. My highest offer this year included a total compensation of $550k. I had offers from trading firms, two FAANGs, tiktok.

appreciate you for being here.
i&#x27;ve always wanted to be an astronaut but i found myself making bits fly instead. i love that which is aesthetic and i take great pride in designing beautiful distributed systems. i enjoy dota, strawberries, and software (in that order).
i like to think reasonably, objectively, creatively, simply, and always with the future in mind. i&#x27;m very strongly opinionated, but i love nothing more than being corrected correctly. i love learning experiences.
the majority of my posts will probably be irrelevant to you, especially since i enjoy yapping, but peruse at your leisure.
always happy to chat on twitter.
see you sometime,

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to share a new Bear Blog theme paying homage to the classic vampire film, Nosferatu. I was inspired to create this one after watching the trailer for the upcoming 2024 remake. The theme has an atmospheric aesthetic that evokes the haunting tone of the original movie. I&#x27;ve designed this theme to be ideal for blogs focused on horror, Gothic literature, or film reviews. The font treatment is also ideal for long-form book reviews or essays. I hope you enjoy exploring the CSS and customizing it to your liking. Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I think I hear rats scratching in the walls...

 Historically, radical social theory and practice have focused on two arenas of human societal activity: the workplace and the community. Beginning with the rise of the Nation-State and with the Industrial Revolution, the economy has acquired a predominant position over the community – not only in capitalist ideology but in the various socialisms, libertarian and authoritarian, that emerged early in the last century. The shift from an ethical emphasis on socialism to an economic one is a problem of far-reaching proportions that has been widely discussed.

 A year and a half after the original dogma podcast series, we have converted the audio to text format. This is a collection of interviews with anarchist activists from Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, Greece and Finland. Inside you will find different views of anarchists on the war in Ukraine and how anarchist movements in different parts of Europe reacted to it. Original conversations happened in January-February 2023, but since then many points remained the same.

 There is currently much discussion among French comrades about whether an anarchist should meet the draft obligation, evade the draft, or desert. 
 Some say that the anarchist, who naturally abhors militarism and continuously makes propaganda against it, must at any cost refuse to wear the abhorrent uniform and take up fratricidal arms, in homage to our principles and to set a good example. 
 Others say that refusing service forces one to go abroad, where, for economic reasons and because of differences in language and customs, he is incapable of making propaganda, whereas it is useful and necessary to bring the spirit of rebellion and the yeast of anarchist ideas within the very ranks of the army. 
 We believe that the matter does not have a single solution, applicable to all individuals, under all circumstances. 
 Aside from considerations of personal advantage, which we shall not get into, it is certain that, depending on each person’s particular talents and the dose and type of courage he possesses, some can be more useful by entering the army, making propaganda among soldiers and setting an example, when the case arises, of refusing obedience and open rebellion, while others better succeed by deserting and facing the vagabond life of a man in an illegal position.

                              <span>This essentially killed my (EU-based) startup in the project management and collaborate space. Before MSFT bundled Teams with O365 we were rapidly growing and closing enterprise customers in the automotive, energy and education industries with high retention rates. Right around the time the Teams bundling started our retention dropped, churn went through the roof, growth slowed down, we failed to raise our next round because of it and had to drastically downsize the company, causing even more churn (about 80% net churn in 2 years). This move by the EU is good, but too little too late - 99% of the companies that were hurt by this have already shut down, and the ones still running will take years to recover...</span>

I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again: https://httptoolkit.com/blog/public-cdn-risks/
You can reduce issues like this using subresource intergrity (SRI) but there are still tradeoffs (around privacy &amp; reliability - see article above) and there is a better solution: self-host your dependencies behind a CDN service you control (just bunny/cloudflare/akamai/whatever is fine and cheap).
In a tiny prototyping project, a public CDN is convenient to get started fast, sure, but if you&#x27;re deploying major websites I would really strong recommend not using public CDNs, never ever ever ever (the World Economic Forum website is affected here, for example! Absolutely ridiculous).</span>

                              <span>Game theory at work?  Someone needs to maintain legacy code for free that hosts thousands of sites and gets nothing but trouble (pride?) in return.  Meanwhile the forces of the world present riches and power in return to turn to the dark side (or maybe just letting your domain lapse and doing something else).
If security means every maintainer of every OSS package you use has to be scrupulous, tireless, and not screw up for life, not sure what to say when this kind of thing happens other than &quot;isn&#x27;t that the only possible outcome given the system and incentives on a long enough timeline?&quot;
Kind of like the &quot;why is my favorite company monetizing now and using dark patterns?&quot;  Well, on an infinite timeline did you think service would remain high quality, free, well supported, and run by tireless, unselfish, unambitious benevolent dictators for the rest of your life? Or was it a foregone question that was only a matter of &quot;when&quot; not &quot;if&quot;?</span>

                              <span>Impressions from last week’s CVPR, a conference with 12k attendees on computer vision - Pretty much everyone is using NVIDIA GPUs, and pretty much everyone isn’t happy with the prices, and would like some competition in the space:
NVIDIA was there with 57 papers, a website dedicated to their research presented at the conference, a full day tutorial on accelerating deep learning, and ever present with shirts and backpacks in the corridors and at poster presentations.
AMD had a booth at the expo part, where they were raffling off some GPUs. I went up to them to ask what framework I should look into, when writing kernels (ideally from Python) for GPGPU. They referred me to the “technical guy”, who it turns out had a demo on inference on an LLM. Which he couldn’t show me, as the laptop with the APU had crashed and wouldn’t reboot. He didn’t know about writing kernels, but told me there was a compiler guy who might be able to help, but he wasn’t to be found at that moment, and I couldn’t find him when returning to the booth later.
I’m not at all happy with this situation. As long as AMDs investment into software and evangelism remains at ~$0, I don’t see how any hardware they put out will make a difference. And you’ll continue to hear people walking away from their booth, saying “oh when I win it I’m going to sell it to buy myself an NVIDIA GPU”.</span>

                              <span>I highly recommend everyone try it out if you&#x27;re in SF. It&#x27;s an incredibly smooth and sure ride. The cars are really nice too (Jaguar I-Pace electric cars), clean and spacious.
The first time you ride in one, it feels truly sci-fi. But within 5 minutes, you&#x27;re almost bored of it - that&#x27;s how good it is. If I had to choose between an Uber of questionable cleanliness and driver temperament and a Waymo with a slightly longer wait and slightly more fare, I&#x27;d choose the Waymo every time.

                              <span>A long long time ago as a poor college student, I signed up to get a “free PC.” You got a shitty packard bell tower for signing away your privacy and allowing a bunch of ads annd telemetry exist in the OS. It really wasn’t that intrusive and eventually the company folded and I got a free (shitty) ad-free pc out of it.
I’m a Mac user now but when I pull up windows 11 on my kid’s or wife’s laptop, it feels like that free-pc dot com again, only it’s in every person’s PC. I’m genuinely shocked at the amount of trash that barrages a common user in windows, and shocked that Microsoft gets away with it.
My 14 year old gets barraged with not just co-pilot but a bunch of news and trash clickbait that is straight inappropriate for kids to see.
I’ve had to remove it all twice but with every significant update, somehow my settings get reversed and we’re back at square one.
I tried even using local accounts but it causes significant issues in the OS.
If you’d told me in 1999 that free-pc.com was the dystopian digital future we’d all be living in, I’d have laughed you out of the room - but that’s exactly what we have. The only difference is that the PC isn’t free. We are.</span>

                              <span>JULIAN ASSANGE IS FREE
Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stanstead airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.
This is the result of a  global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom  campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum,  all the way to the United Nations. This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible.
After more than five years in a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars.
WikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles,and for the people&#x27;s right to know.
As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom.
Julian&#x27;s freedom is our freedom.

NTP is worth moving to a memory safe language but of course it&#x27;s not the single most critical thing in our entire stack to make memory safe. I don&#x27;t think anyone is claiming that. It&#x27;s simply the first component that got to production status, a good place to start.
NTP is a component worth moving to a memory safe language because it&#x27;s a widely used critical service on a network boundary. A quick Google for NTP vulnerabilities will show you that there are plenty of memory safety vulnerabilities lurking in C NTP implementations:
https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2153...
Some of these are severe, some aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s only a matter of time though until another severe one pops up.
I don&#x27;t think any critical service on a network boundary should be written in C/C++, we know too much at this point to think that&#x27;s a good idea. It will take a while to change that across the board though.
If I had to pick the most important thing in the context of Let&#x27;s Encrypt to move to a memory safe language it would be DNS. We have been investing heavily in Hickory DNS but it&#x27;s not ready for production at Let&#x27;s Encrypt yet (our usage of DNS is a bit more complex than the average use case).
https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns
Work is proceeding at a rapid pace and I expect Hickory DNS to be deployed at Let&#x27;s Encrypt in 2025.</span>

                              <span>This happened to me. I was wondering why my internet speeds were slow when I discovered that Microsoft was in the process of uploading my users directory, they had already uploaded almost two gigs when I realized. They also changed the path to these directories to something like C:\Users\name\OneDrive\Desktop\. Another poster in this thread claimed it&#x27;s easy to reverse -- I disagree, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to track down the setting, and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do this. When I did, it gave me an error for one of the directories and refuses to revert (documents?).
I don&#x27;t like leaving negative or hyperbolic comments on HN, but this was enraging and unacceptable to me. It&#x27;s hard to convey without coming off as unhinged. I only ever boot into Windows nowadays when I need to compile and test a Windows build of software. I understand Microsoft has built up good will through efforts like VS Code, but it&#x27;s all undone because of things like this. I avoid MS products, they cannot be trusted.</span>

If I still can&#x27;t find myself gaining control of depression, then I can give up, but at least I would have given up contently knowing I tried.
Last night, I was unable to sleep (unfortunately, insomnia seems to be a common side effect in antidepressants). I stared up the ceiling aimlessly, and pondered, A month has passed. Even more. I am still the same. What changed?
I was clearly anxious and upset throughout the day, because I skipped work too. I told myself I deserved a break, but deep down I knew I was lying to myself. The break was an excuse.

                              <span>U.S. inflation surged in the early post-COVID period, driven by several economic shocks such as supply chain disruptions and labor supply constraints. Following its peak at 6.6 percent in September 2022, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down rapidly over the last two years, falling to 3.6 percent recently. What explains the rapid shifts in U.S. inflation dynamics? In a recent paper, we show that the interaction between supply chain pressures and labor market tightness amplified the inflation surge in 2021. In this post, we argue that these same forces that drove the nonlinear rise in inflation have worked in reverse since late 2022, accelerating the disinflationary process. The current episode contrasts with periods where the economy was hit by shocks to either imported inputs or to labor alone.</span>

                              <span>I struggle with this thing, of remembering certain people in such a golden light. Before this seems like a post talking about not-so-good people, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s about perfectly nice people.
The thing is, the way I tend to remember people is by how they made me feel. Few people in my life have made me feel like a real, raw person when talking to them. But some have. Some of these people are miles away, and have maybe always been miles away, both geographically and otherwise.
It&#x27;s a really painful thing, because as these memories I hold go further and further back in my memory, I don&#x27;t know what I want anymore. All I really want is to feel the way they made me feel again. Not so easy though, is it?
We&#x27;ve both grown in separate ways, and I&#x27;m grateful for where I am in my life, I think I&#x27;ve done pretty alright for myself so far. No matter what I do though, it does feel like there&#x27;s a certain hole in my life, somewhere I&#x27;m lacking greatly. The remedy is so far though. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t even exist, not anymore.</span>

                              <span>I’m not a fan of having dark mode on my site because I have a hard time choosing colors that speak to me. I like to keep things minimalistic with my colors, and for me, it’s just much easier to do with a white background. However, I know (and acknowledge) the importance of having one, and so I pushed myself to do some tinkering on the blog this morning. Besides, my eyeballs also hate me when I look at my site at night, and so I’m sure it’s the case for other people too.
I subscribe to a lot of blogs via RSS reader, but I do take the extra step to launch their site to read the post. I have a deep appreciation for those who take the time to design their site the way they want, and so I want to read their posts the way it was meant to be read. It’s kind of like: listening to an album in order because I know that the artist ordered it a specific way for people to listen to. At the same time, it’s OK if you want to shuffle the playlist if you as the consumer want to, just like it’s OK for those who read my posts to do so via an RSS feed.
Anyways, this is just a quick post to say that, if your preference is dark mode, it is now available on here. I’ll revisit my site again at night time to test out the color contrasts (since I worked on this during daytime) to see if it makes sense, or if my eyeballs are still straining to read things.
Due to this, I’ve also gone ahead and created a Changelog for my site, so I can keep track of the little (and big) changes I make on here.
Side note:
I typically do have my screens on dark mode, and so if the sites/blog I read have dark mode, I read those in dark mode. It’s a weird thing for me to want my site in a lighter background, but I do struggle with it sometimes. Thanks to those who have put up with probably burning your retinas reading my posts if you weren’t doing so in an RSS reader. I appreciate you.

I have been subbed to Claude Opus for a few months (yes, I am an earlier believer than you people). Couple of days back, I was working on a project and opened Anthropic chat. Then I realised it was showing &quot;Sonnet 3.5 - Our most intelligent model&quot; and it was seriously a major surprise.
I have been playing with with it for a couple of days now. Wrote some code ranging from Python, HTML, CSS, JSS to Pytorch and Jax. Made it do some editing and proof-reading. So far it&#x27;s been smooth sailing. Maybe we haven&#x27;t hit a wall yet (Ok I am not important enough to comment on this but you gotta remember it&#x27;s my blog).
But why vibe-check, aren&#x27;t benchmarks enough? Oversimplifying here but I think you cannot trust benchmarks blindly. There can be benchmark data leakage/overfitting to be…</span>
