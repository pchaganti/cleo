                              <span>I&#x27;ve dabbled in management a few times in my career. This meant attending manager-only meetings and trainings. I&#x27;ll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, &quot;The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they&#x27;ll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else.&quot; This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.
After I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I&#x27;d need to be &quot;one of them.&quot; I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.
I know not every manager is like that. I&#x27;d like to think I wasn&#x27;t. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.</span>

                              <span>In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.
The Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.
The report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.
Indeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he&#x27;d done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.</span>

In beautiful EU bureaucratic style It&#x27;s a framework for how to talk about how a European Cloud could look like.
It&#x27;s not about technical standards. It&#x27;s about how we can talk about how we can think of maybe eventually deciding on how we can come up with standards that might one day lead to talk about implementations.
It represents to me everything that is wrong with the EU today. A bureaucratic monster that can&#x27;t decide how to talk about things or come to any form of alignment.</span>

                              <span>A lot of really terrible takes in this comment section. Telegram didn&#x27;t have encrypted groups by default, and telegram possessed a lot of content on their servers that they had been made aware was illegal and didn&#x27;t cooperate. Nothing more, nothing less.
The comparisons to other providers is off base because either other providers are cooperating more when they possess actionable, unencrypted information and taking steps to detect or prevent such recurrences or they are like Signal and do not have access to the underlying material in the first place or store it for very long anyway.
One cannot legally run a hosted, unmoderated content platform in the developed world, one will always be required to remove illegal materials and turn over materials in cooperation with law enforcement.</span>

                              <span>This seems like the Kim Dotcom situation again.
Why are these service providers being punished for what their users do? Specifically, these service providers? Because Google, Discord, Reddit, etc. all  contain some amount of CSAM (and other illegal content), yet I don&#x27;t see Pichai, Citron, or Huffman getting indicted for anything.
Hell, then there&#x27;s the actual infrastructure providers too. This seems like a slippery slope with no defined boundaries where the government can just arbitrary use to pin the blame on the people they don&#x27;t like. Because ultimately, almost every platform with user-provided content will have some quantity of illegal material.
But maybe I&#x27;m just being naive?</span>

                              <span>Hey guys! We&#x27;re engineers/designers from France, and we&#x27;ve built the Ultimate DIY Battery that you can repair and refill!
It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike?
We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence!
Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it:
- What is the Gouach Battery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NsuW1NPkvNk
- Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mLoCihE0eIA
- Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EDJpt7RDbRM
Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com
We&#x27;d love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community
Oh, and it&#x27;s launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery!

                              <span>Today marks two years since closing on our house in the San Francisco Bay Area (California). It feels both like it just happened yesterday, and a lifetime ago.
Buying this house was not the easiest. During the entire nightmare of a process, I remember thinking that I wanted to blog about it (I wasn’t writing yet then) in detail, so that all first time homebuyers could avoid the stress we endured. Also, no one ever teaches you any of this in school, so I’m not exactly sure how anyone could know the process until they’re knees deep in it already.
Yes, there are plenty of articles out there about the house buying process, but it still doesn’t truly prepare you for the real thing. At least it didn’t for us.
I want to caveat that this house was not my first house. In 2012, I bought my first hou…</span>

The app solves many problems I have, but it solves each one poorly.
The app solves some problems I have and some that I don’t, making parts of it useless to me.
I don’t want what they call a Super-app. I want an app designed to solve something specific, one that has been thoughtfully crafted to address a particular need. This doesn’t mean that I want an app for every little thing. The “one thing” could also be a big thing; it just needs to be focused.</span>

Every once in a while I discover a real gem where someone&#x27;s efforts are all at once entertaining, thought provoking, inspiring and original. I&#x27;ll often be stricken with a pang of jealousy. &quot;I want to write like that&quot;, I&#x27;ll tell myself, knowing that I won&#x27;t. Alas, I write like me. I might get some inspiration or an idea for a day&#x27;s entry from one of my favorite bloggers, but I&#x27;m never going to be them.

Title: Do Anarchists Dream of Emancipated Sheep?
Subtitle: Contemporary Anarchism, Animal Liberation and the Implications of New Philosophy
Source: Chapter from ‘Anarchism and Animal Liberation: Essays on Complementary Elements of Total Liberation’ (ISBN: 0786494573). 

 Everything fits together, from the bird whose brood is crushed to the humans whose nest is destroyed by war. 
 —Louise Michel 
 In this essay I explore the relations between contemporary anarchism and animal rights/liberation through the lens of Deleuze/Guattari-inflected complex systems theory. Specifically, I look at the liberalism and normative practices endemic to the mainstream animal rights movement, engaging with some of the more salient critiques that have emerged from Leftist an…</span>

As the United States’ position of dominance in the world has been challenged in recent decades, economic sanctions have taken a more central position in its strategy for maintaining global power and influence. As Stuart Davis and Immanuel Ness noted in a 2022 article arguing that sanctions are a form of war, “the US has depended increasingly on economic, political and cultural hegemony as partial substitutes for military power through the application of economic sanctions.”

In 2007, the writer Tal Nitsán isolated instances where Israeli male combatants systematically used sexual violence against Palestinian women to the war of 1948.  In essentially marking off such conduct from more contemporary practices, she relied on media accounts, archival sources, the reports of human rights organizations and the testimony of 25 Israeli reserve male soldiers.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a kind of strategy game called Fall of an Empire (https://fallofanempiregame.com), it&#x27;s a bit like a mix between Crusader Kings, Total War, Mount and Blade type games (just the overworld, not the battles), but rather than expanding you&#x27;re trying to prevent an empire from collapsing.
It&#x27;s a ton of work, especially with the number of systems - you&#x27;ve got combat, resource management, settlement development, food managment, espionage, diplomacy etc - these all need to play together well. And then you&#x27;ve got to add in the storyline, graphics, marketing -but I think I&#x27;m making pretty good progress.
I&#x27;m still using Unreal Engine 4 because I started work on that version and I haven&#x27;t needed to upgrade to 5 since it&#x27;s been released.
I&#x27;ve got a free prologue that I&#x27;m releasing on October 1, so now until then is a lot of polishing to make it work well.</span>

                              <span>Boeing was awarded more money for their vehicle, had years of extra time and two previous demonstration flights. This flight should have been close to flawless given the additional time Boeing had for remediation and testing. Boeing engineers should have understood their systems well enough to convincingly demonstrate the vehicle met NASA&#x27;s safety requirements. Even after much additional testing during the flight they couldn&#x27;t make their case. Starliner will probably complete its third uncrewed return intact and people might question if NASA was being overly cautious but perhaps Boeing should have supplied a crewed vehicle with reliable thrusters and avoided this embarrassment.</span>

                              <span>Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.
As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.
Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.
And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.
Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.</span>

I still use Reddit but way less than I used to before, and I no longer use it for fun but just to read niche tech subs.
I refuse to use the official mobile app. I&#x27;ve always used Baconreader and then Relay on Android. Relay survived the API changes and adopted a subscription model.
But thanks to Revanced I was able to patch an old version of Relay to use my own API key for free.</span>

                              <span>I swear, MS kills all the useful features in Windows.
For comparison, configuring a network interface using Control Panel is simple, straight forward and allows me to change all the settings I want. Trying to do the same thing using the Settings app is complex, it hides pretty nuch all of the advanced settings that you want to see or change. And on top of that, it doesn’t even show you how long that interface has been connected to the network and how much data was transferred both ways: incredible debugging info lost.
Oh, and the fact that you can’t tick which updates you want and which you don’t…
I’m pretty sure others have other gripes with the “streamlined experience”.</span>

                              <span>🗓️ // August 17 - August 23, 2024
Woke up a few hours early on a Saturday morning to make a cup of coffee and get this written before we are out and about today.
I went back to work on Monday + Tuesday feeling absolutely sick and miserable. I really struggled but pushed through it to ensure that the team was prepared before I take a few days off next week. If only my co-workers could’ve seen how terrible I felt running all of the meetings. Thankfully stopped feeling like the walking dead by Wednesday.
Still trying to get myself out of this feeling I’ve been feeling lately, whatever it may be.
Blaugust 2024 is almost over. Will I make it to 31 days? Spoiler Alert: I still don’t have any pre-written posts. I’ve been winging it all month. Can you tell?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written before about how I&#x27;ve had a gratitude practice for a long time, nothing too elaborate, just three bullet points in my journal each night. I&#x27;m often grateful for some of life&#x27;s little comforts over and over again, things like a good meal I didn&#x27;t have to cook or an especially entertaining show on TV. A long time ago, I read The Miracle of Mindfulness by Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh in which he encourages a junior monk to peel an orange while savoring the moment, to do nothing but feel and smell and taste the orange. When I have the presence of mind to do such things, I like to savor moments of small joy while they are happening and then to reflect on them afterwords. I&#x27;m not above escaping from my present reality at times and looking forward to something that&#x27;s hap…</span>

And not just Harris. The entire leadership of the party, from AOC to the Obamas joined in. Even Bernie Sanders played along.

                              <span>I left my AirPods Pro at a school sports field an hour away, and I didn&#x27;t realize until the next morning after it been raining heavily. I gave them up for lost and needed headphones for work – so ordered some from Apple with same day delivery.
A week later, I got a Find My notification that they had been spotted – at the same sports field. I figured what the hell, put on a podcast and drove the hour to see if I could find them. Worst case scenario, a couple of hours of driving.
Using Find My and the directional feature points you in the right direction to within feet, I found them in the tall grass.
The case had been perfectly watertight, and they&#x27;d barely lost a percent of power in a week. Remarkable really all round.</span>

                              <span>I can imagine a series of events at MS like below (A pure imagination):
1. A new UX head is hired and looks for something that will make them look important.
2. Initiate a usability research across all the features in the Windows UI.
3. Make an internal announcement. &quot;Our research shows that many users are scared of changing settings in Control Panel. They are afraid of breaking the system by changing anything there. We will create a new UX for changing settings in a simple, intuitive, and innovative way.&quot;
4. They hire many UX researchers, visual designers, UI prototypers, and of course many middle managers.
5. A year later, another announcement. &quot;We now have a complete understanding of how we can create a simple, intuitive, and innovative user experience. Now our engineering team will implement this in upcoming years.&quot;
6. They hire many product managers, UI engineers, program managers, QA team, and of course many middle managers.
7. Two years later, another announcement. &quot;We are launching the new innovative UX that replaces Control Panel&quot;.
8. Get a lot of internal feedback. &quot;The new UI doesn&#x27;t let me change X or Y setting&quot;, &quot;The new UI is too slow&quot;, &quot;Too much whitespace in the new UI&quot;, etc. They are all ignored as &quot;working as intended&quot;. They say &quot;X and Y settings are used by very few users. Use the old UI for those settings.&quot;
9. Several years later, &quot;We don&#x27;t have enough engineering resources to maintain two different apps. Let&#x27;s kill Control Panel.&quot;</span>

                              <span>A counter point on premium VR headsets. They are teleportation devices.
I&#x27;ve used every popular VR device, but one Vision Pro experience stood out - &#x27;The Haleakala environment&#x27;[1]
It was literally like being transported there. I know because I had been in that exact spot a few years before. I have a rich visual memory which served as reference, and no exaggeration, it felt like was there. I was immediately in tears. It was profound.
The Vision pro&#x27;s lack of a killer app because development is unintuitive, userbase is small, the UX is alien and the hardware costs of constructing these experience is still rather high. Give it a few years. The hardware is already there. This isn&#x27;t a solution in search of a problem. This is PalmOS, a solution that is too early to the market.
I have family with disabilities. Being able to teleport my loved ones to places they could never go themselves is worth the $3000. If I could record my most profound memories with &#x27;VR recorder&#x27;, I would. My parent missed my graduation because of being continents away. You think they wouldn&#x27;t want to be teleported to it ? Wedding photographers cost $4000+, so we can relive those memories through shoddy snapshots. Why not be teleported back to the most beautiful day ?
Don&#x27;t knock it till you try it.

The new pages seem designed by someone who only knew how to build a vertical layout and just stacked all controls without a care for the user. I am also amused how the modern window takes a good second plus to paint.</span>

                              <span>Similar experience: Citibank Retirement.
I had about $80,000 in IRA/CD&#x27;s. I&#x27;d created &amp; contributed to them over a period of 35 years.
Last year, it&#x27;s time to retire, and Citibank won&#x27;t give me half the money.  It seems that some CD&#x27;s are for &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; and some for &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Citibank Retirement demanded a &quot;Marriage Certificate, Divorce Decree, or Court Order&quot; to demonstrate that &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; is the same person as &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Took more than 8 months, dozens of emails, five visits to Citibank offices, and a letter to the Citibank president, to shake loose money that I&#x27;d deposited across three decades.</span>

All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let&#x27;s give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn&#x27;t much to a determined spammer, but I didn&#x27;t want to be…</span>

                              <span>There are random days when I look at my blog and am tempted to scrap it all. It’s not because I hate it, or am unhappy with it, but mostly because I have this need and want to start all over again; a new slate if you will.
I start thinking: does this tiny corner of the internet I’ve created reflect who I am? Sometimes I’m OK with my answer, and then there are days when I’m not.
I’m not super happy with my dark mode color palette. I want to make changes to it but I don’t have a clue on what I want yet. I wish I can keep my theme on light mode, but I also don’t want to burn peoples retinas. The dark mode stays. Pending updates later.
Robert recently created a Bear theme, Bearming. This inspired me to make tiny changes to my page until I can figure out what I want.

                              <span>Today, I want to write about why I do this—why I wake up early and take the trouble to get up, go upstairs, and make some coffee. I’ve been wondering about this these past few days. Why make myself go through it? Why not just stay in bed and sleep an extra hour? Such a nice, soft, warm bed.
Every day I tell myself the same thing: “You’ll feel much better if you do!” And it’s true! I don’t know of any tonic that’s as good for my mood, energy, and mental health as a solid hour of writing in the morning before life starts. It feels like a luxury, really, having the time to do this, and I’m grateful. It’s just me, the sunrise, my dog sitting next to me, and the sound of the pen as it scratches meaning on paper, echoing in the silent dining room.
I’ve been writing this way for a bit over a year…</span>

 “Anarchism is still the most beautiful ideal, and I think someday it will come,” wrote Lau Chung-Si (Ray Jones) from a small apartment in San Francisco. At the time he put these words to paper in 1974, he was a relic of another time. Jones was a Chinese man who, in 1909, immigrated to the United States and quickly became enamoured with the ideas of anarchism. He was involved in a collective of Chinese American anarchists in San Francisco named Pingsheh (Equality Society). He also attended meetings held by ot…</span>

                              <span>The full scope of Israel’s assault on Gaza is revealed through its relentless military actions, characterized by indiscriminate violence against women, children, the elderly, and non-combatants. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, the scale of destruction imposed on Gaza is not only devastating but ethically unimaginable. Since the start of the war, and as of the end of November 2023, Israel has reportedly dropped over 25,000 tons of explosives on the Gaza Strip, a force equivalent to two nuclear bombs. This means that the destructive power of the explosives dropped on Gaza in just over two months exceeded that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[4] According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the use of such highly destructive bombs in residential areas constitutes a war crime.

But this piece of common sense seems to have dropped out of the brains – if they have them – of American congressional and white house leaders. During his presidential tenure, Donald “The Tariff Man” Trump slapped tariffs on washing machines, aluminum, steel, solar panels and other goods, totaling $380 billion worth of trade from China, the U.S.’s third biggest trading partner. That amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion. Not to be outdone in the stupidity sweepstakes, Joe “Copycat” Biden added his tariffs. They affected batteries, steel, aluminum, semiconductors, solar cells, electric vehicles, critical minerals and more. More

adopting a new (v1beta4) version of
its configuration file format. Configuration in the previous v1beta3 format is now formally

I&#x27;ll explain about the kubeadm v1beta4 configuration format,

                              <span>[Firebase founder] The thing I&#x27;m excited about w/Instant is the quad-fecta of offline + real-time + relational queries + open source. The amount of requests we had for relational queries was off-the-charts (and is a hard engineering problem), and, while the Firebase clients are OSS, I failed to open source a reference backend (a longer story).
Good luck, Joe, Stopa and team!</span>

                              <span>&gt; Only a very few people possess the level of discernment needed to know how bad your local concert hall&#x27;s piano is, and precisely how it is bad. If their art dies out, maybe nobody will know how bad all the pianos are. And then we&#x27;ll all have slightly worse pianos than we would otherwise have. And I mean if that&#x27;s the way things are going to go, then let&#x27;s just steer the Earth into the Sun, because what&#x27;s the point of any of this.
The problem with this line of thinking -- &quot;If X happens then we&#x27;ll all be cooked!&quot; -- is that it ignores the fact that X already has been happening and yet life is just fine.
There&#x27;s an infinite number of pursuits in which expert practitioners could theoretically possess a level of discernment so sublime that nobody else can understand it, let alone appreciate it.
A huge number of these arts will either never be practiced, or were practiced in the past but have already decline. And yet there&#x27;s no mass ennui or clamoring to steer the Earth into the sun.
The pinnacle of human attention cannot be directed at everything, everywhere, all at once. We have to focus our attention on a limited subset of arts and pursuits, where discernment will always be high, and settle everywhere else.</span>

                              <span>We cannot forget that we also loose something with working remotely (say more than 75% of the time) and that is the occasional bumping into each other at the water cooler or in the morning when coming in. These are situations you can artificially create by scheduling calls to socialize etc, but that is still not comparable with being in an actual office.
By categorically saying no to quick calls, you&#x27;re isolating yourself even more. While it can be distracting to jump on a call while you actually meant to focus on some coding, it can also be great to have a quick chat and brainstorm about an idea rather than let the other person work out the solution in isolation only for me to then suggest a totally different approach in the PR review (yay! asynchronous!).</span>

                              <span>&gt; Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves.
One thing I loved about doing technical enterprise sales is that I’d meet people doing something I knew little or nothing about and who didn’t really understand what we offered but had a problem they could explain and our offering could help with.
They’d have deep technical knowledge of their domain and we had the same in ours, and there was just enough shared knowledge at the interface between the two that we could have fun and useful discussions. Lots of mutual respect.  I’ve always enjoyed working with smart people even when I don’t really understand what they do.
Of course there were also idiots, but generally they weren’t interested in paying what we charged, so that was OK.
&gt; Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves.
So I feel a lot of sympathy for the author — that would be terribly soul sucking.
I guess generative grammars have increased the number of “I have a great idea for a technical business, I just need a technical co founder” who think that an idea is 90% of it and have no idea what technical work actually is.</span>

They say that home is where the heart is, and I wholeheartedly agree. A home doesn’t have to be a place, but if you had to put a place to it, where would you consider home to be?
My cousins, back in my birth country, will ask: “When are you coming home?” It always stops me in my tracks. I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time. Although I try to hold on to my culture, my identity closely tied to it, the country itself is more of a distant past than a present reality. And yet, to them, it is still my home.

                              <span>My definition of pride is caring about what other people think of me and for the most part I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s a bold statement and I don&#x27;t mean for it to be. I definitely care about how people treat me and that&#x27;s often tied into their opinion so I&#x27;m not being an absolutist. Some things that a lot of people find important are of little interest to me, cars for example. I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry with 230K miles on it that is a hand me down from my mother. I&#x27;m almost 60. I also don&#x27;t try to appear neutral on controversial topics. My wife has to shush me around Republicans because I have a tendency to tell her the latest asshole thing they&#x27;ve done at a volume level loud enough to be heard by people who may disagree with me.

                              <span>After applying to 200+ positions over the past four months (and getting interviewed for just two of them - it&#x27;s rough out there!), I&#x27;m super excited to have accepted an offer for a position that&#x27;s basically tailor-made for my skills and aspirations. I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to focus on the sort of platform-y work that I want to do. It&#x27;s going to be so much fun!
Of course, before I can get to the new gig I&#x27;ll spend the next three weeks wrapping up and/or handing off everything that I&#x27;d been working on for my current employer. It&#x27;s a good thing that past-John typically did a good job of documenting things as he went. Still, it&#x27;s going to be a busy few weeks!
Oh, and that other position that I interviewed for? I got rejected, and the company went on to break the entire world the following week. So I guess that one actually worked out pretty well for me, too.</span>

&quot;I don&#x27;t want to work in IT anymore.&quot;
I saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.
I had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!
But over time, something started to feel off. I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.
Then one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.
– Yes, I can&#x27;t imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.
In that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!
When I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.
Fast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.
And when it comes to IT, I&#x27;m more passionate about it now that it&#x27;s a hobby instead of a career. It&#x27;s fun again!
Are you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.
Chok Dee, as they say in Thailand.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes I get tired of formulating words to help things make sense. At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.
I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

&quot;I know you might be worried about regrets later, but sometimes it&#x27;s okay to break the ritual, to interrupt the flow, to just pause and breathe it all in. No achievement is going to light up above your head when you write all the words, read all the books, collect all the things. Not one that&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run anyway. Be joyful when you can, be reflective when you need to be, but most of all, focus on being. If that means writing, great. If that means quiet, that&#x27;s great too.&quot; by Netigen

&gt; Asked whether Mozilla has any concerns that its user base, many ardent ad-blockers among them, will oppose Anonym, a spokesperson for the Firefox house told The Register advertising as a business model is what allows the internet to be free and open to everyone, though there&#x27;s still room for improvement.
No, the internet being free and open is what allows advertisers to exploit us. They can find other business models other than advertisement. It&#x27;s not our problem. They need to stop making it our problem.

                              <span>When I was a teenageer a school counselor incorrectly perceived me to be in a crisis and had me sent to 72 hour hold (which stays on certain records for quite a while and can be incredibly disruptive, but that&#x27;s besides the point) - for some reason I was sent almost 40 miles away in another county in a city I&#x27;d never been. The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn&#x27;t belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn&#x27;t enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn&#x27;t have my glasses, phone, or wallet.
I really don&#x27;t know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car. I had to beg for money and walk the last several miles once I recognized finally where I was. It really sucked, and ever since then I&#x27;ve had a great deal of sympathy for people that are churned through this terrible system and spit right back out with no dignity whatsoever, let alone empathy. This incident disrupted my life irreversibly (ended up missing tests and having to do a medical withdrawal from school, lost scholarships, etc) and derailed a lot of things I had wanted to do for many, many years. The hospital/medical care industrial complex doesn&#x27;t optimize for empathy. They&#x27;re just trying to get the bodies through as quickly as possible.</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;d be amazed how bad hospitals can be at keeping track of fairly critical things.
I had a cousin who voluntarily checked himself into the hospital related to severe withdrawal symptoms (and had bouts of psychosis related to said with withdrawal - meth addictions are nasty).  His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.
Late that night, he was discharged. Not even &quot;he checked himself out&quot;. The hospital discharged him (and that&#x27;s over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).
He had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn&#x27;t remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn&#x27;t get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.
The hospital had his mother&#x27;s contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.
We still don&#x27;t know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.
Forcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I&#x27;m furious about it.  Apparently it&#x27;s common and not even something there&#x27;s any recourse for.</span>

Price also acts as signaling that this is a tool for professionals who make actual money and so shouldn&#x27;t be bothered coughing up something trivial like $100 for a subscription.  You end up making more with far less customer support.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design.
This is a super underappreciated fact!  It&#x27;s often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.
Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.
Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.
Think of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.
For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.  Blacksmiths had a legitimately intellectual job back in the day!</span>

                              <span>Can relate, I&#x27;ve been in a similar boat running a small B2B Saas over the last 2 years. It does get easier over time.
I&#x27;ve learnt a few tricks for managing early stage pain points.
- You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support.
- Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future.
- Invest in good docs, even if you&#x27;re not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.
I think a lot of literature around running a online biz has been boiled down to rather basic advice and its hard to find anything solid in this area. I&#x27;ve been running a small blog where I document these issues(operational.co) if anyone wants to check it out.</span>

                              <span>There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, kubectl debug is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It
provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&#x27;s point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image&#x3D;busybox --profile&#x3D;netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific
necessities, and unfortunately, some can&#x27;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.

                              <span>This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.31 to improve the handling of supplementary groups in containers within Pods.
Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image
Although this behavior may not be popular with many Kubernetes cluster users/admins, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image.
Let&#x27;s see an example, below Pod specifies runAsUser&#x3D;1000, runAsGroup&#x3D;3000 and supplementalGroups&#x3D;4000 in the Pod&#x27;s security context.

                              <span>In Kubernetes v1.31, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to CPU management capabilities: the distribute-cpus-across-cores option for the CPUManager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.
Understanding the feature
Traditionally, Kubernetes&#x27; CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…</span>

Title: Thoughts During Imprisonment
Date: Oct 26, 1909
Source: Nihon Rekishi Issue 131 (1951)

 It is government suppression. It is tyranny. 
 Even until now, I am unable to give a viewpoint on whether the ending of a human life is a good or bad thing, regardless of someone giving me a good or bad name for it. Daring to be brief about whether or not to end a human life, I am neither for nor against either choice, because I am for the sake of everybody’s happiness, with an unshakeable faith to stand on the impossible conviction of working for the freedom of any or even all people. 
 I wish that I will behave in accordance with the demands of reason and not based on the demands of immediate emotions or instincts based on material desire. If this course of action is in a…</span>

                              <span>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet&#x27;s cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn&#x27;t new
enough to have support for this feature.</span>

                              <span>The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

                              <span>&quot;What&#x27;s the secret?&quot;
I asked this question to one of my clients today. He was 85 years old, looked 60, and was as fit and agile as a 50-year-old.
He replied: &quot;There&#x27;s no secret. I enjoy walking. That’s all.&quot;
No secrets. No tricks. Completely natural.
But that&#x27;s often how it is, isn’t it; we think there&#x27;s a code to crack, a secret recipe to follow to achieve success. When in reality, the answer lies in the most natural thing in the world.
If we want to increase our chances of being in good shape, then we need to make sure we move around a bit. If we want to become a better writer, then we need to make sure we write a lot.

                              <span>I’m currently outside, having a smoking break.
I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

Around 2AM this morning I had a realization that this was the most stressed I have ever been. On verge of a complete breakdown.
Why? Because I noticed around 10PM that jumpcomedy.com was entirely broken with all HTTP POST calls made by RTK Query failing. Nothing worked and though I had deployed recent changes, none of them would cause this. I was at a complete loss as to where to look, especially as this is working locally. Posting on the usual Discords (NextJS, Vercel) is leading to dead silence. I&#x27;m alone and have to fix this issue which I didn&#x27;t cause.
This isn&#x27;t the first production defect I&#x27;ve introduced in my 25 years of working, but this is the first one where I had absolutely nobody to turn to in a time of crisis while customer complaints are pilin…</span>

                              <span>I no longer want to simply be a developer, an artist, or a sporty person. I’ve changed my mindset:
from &quot;I want to be a developer&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who enjoys tinkering with coding and tech every day,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be an artist&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who appreciates and creates art,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be a runner&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who loves running and taking walks.&quot;
This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.
I remind myself that becoming is a lifelong journey that never truly ends. We never completely become anything; we are always in the process of becoming. So, there’s no point in fixating on final results.
Just enjoy the path, stay on the path, and keep becoming.</span>

 Another fighter became a martyr. On August 9, our comrade and anarchist-internationalist from Russia, Vladislav Iurchenko (nom de guerre “Pirate”), was killed in battle. He was 22 years old. Vladislav was part of the “Siberian Battalion” of the International Legion, and he was martyred in a fight during a landing operation on the Kinburn Spit.

Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.</span>
