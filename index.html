                              <span>By Friday, at least 110,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee Rafah, which is now under bombardment. Many of them have already been displaced two or three times. But all of them know nowhere is safe in Gaza now.

                              <span>In the morning vendors sell wares out of cargo bicycles and vans along the main road. There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.
If I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides.

                              <span>I feel I need to report my experience from Denmark, Jutland.
It started with white broad streaks, which most of all looked like fog, but then perhaps after 10 minutes or so, we saw colors of red, purple and green begin to emerge from the these streaks. Most astoundingly it all seemed to emanate from a fluctuating point in the middle of the sky. If you looked closely at this point  you could see it fall into itself, morphing and shifting continuously.
We went around the house and we could purple streaks at the top and orange to red patches at the bottom of the sky.
Colors observed:
Whitish blue,  
Green,
Purple,  
Red,
and Orange
An absolutely a beautiful experience.</span>

                              <span>A gold Volkswagen Jetta with no seatbelts picks us up from the airport. Our driver talks to Mom in thick accent, slurring syllables together in bunches. There are many words I can’t catch, but the lilting rhythm falls comfortably on my ears.
I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…</span>

                              <span>I’m writing on the way to bring my dog Worm to a park where we have sessions with a professional dog trainer. This is our seventh. We’ve been putting it off the past three weeks because it’s been way too hot to meet up at our usual 10am, so he suggested we meet a few hours earlier. The sun is up but not punishingly hot at 8, but this time is also the median hour of the sleep schedule I keep these days.
I agreed anyway, thinking it would be a good reason to make myself go to bed a little earlier—lying to myself as usual, lol.
Worm sleeps in my bed with me, bracketed by my right hip and a long pillow. She settles in most easily when I’m next to her, which means I’m technically in bed by 11pm. But my brain is never off that early, and I’ve developed the bad habit of bringing my laptop with me…</span>

                              <span>Will be interesting to see how this affects math research.  He has pumped unthinkable amounts of money into the field.  The only first-class flights I&#x27;ve taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)
Besides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that&#x27;s just the stuff that I&#x27;ve benefited from personally. I know there&#x27;s more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I&#x27;ve never heard of. He was very good to us all.
We&#x27;ve always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.  Simons making $3 billion, the rest of us making 90k apiece.</span>

                              <span>My initial reaction to the ad, upon watching it in the launch event was &quot;huh, that&#x27;s a fun reference to the Hydraulic Press Channel&quot;. The slapstick elements (trumpet noise, squishy balls) made it come across as light-hearted, rather than an ominous display of force by a large company crushing artists&#x27; tools.
This idea of &#x27;squashing all these tools down to a thin slab of glass&#x27; made sense given their somewhat unusual focus on the thinness of the device. It was a bit of a throwback to the early 2010s smartphone innovation, where the size of the devices was the yardstick by which manufacturers would outdo each other. I would charitably interpret it as an uninspired marketing team trying to spin some version of Jobs&#x27; classic &quot;the iPhone is simultaneously an iPod, phone and internet device&quot; - however the party trick is old, and nobody&#x27;s impressed anymore.
Perhaps the blowback is a sign of a wider weariness that people have accumulated towards big tech companies over the past few years, mixed with a nebulous malaise about &#x27;AI&#x27; and what it means for the status quo and people&#x27;s livelihoods.</span>

                              <span>It’s not my place to tell anyone how they should feel about anything, but the number of comments here suggesting people had a strong emotional reaction to this does kinda worry me. How do those of you who feel so strongly about this ad get through daily life? If I was feeling so upset about something like this, life would be pretty bad. Genuine question.
EDIT: I appreciate the amount of good-faith discussion on this comment. To be clear, if your reaction to the ad was along the lines of ‘this is distasteful and I don’t like it’, I totally get that. I’m referring to some of the comments I saw that likened it to ‘stress inducing’ or ‘like watching someone’s arm get cut off’ which are much more emotive.</span>

                              <span>It goes beyond aesthetics for me. It&#x27;s like they took everyone&#x27;s deepest fears about technology and AI, that it will replace or &quot;crush&quot; authentic human experience and creativity, and they just embraced and celebrate it by literally crushing representations of human creativity. At least I&#x27;m glad the corporate types were actually honest about their goals, though, instead of their typical doublespeak</span>

For that reason, he was also exactly the kind of person Israel has been targeting for elimination under the cover of its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. More

                              <span>A discussion of the origins of urbanization may provide some insight into the character of modern social problems by highlighting the long historical dynamic at work. It may not be out of place here to point out that anti‑states are well known in the modern world, above all in what the U.S. Federal Reserve Board classifies as eleven offshore banking centers. Five such enclaves are in the Caribbean: Panama, the Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the British West Indies (Cayman Islands). Three enclaves—Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore—were founded to conduct the China trade. The remaining three are Liberia, Lebanon, and Bahrain at the mouth of the Persian Gulf—the island which Bronze Age Sumerians called Dilmun when they used it to trade with the Indus valley and the Iranian shore.

                              <span>The UAW is on a roll. After winning stupendous contracts at the Big Three automakers this past year, the union then organized Volkswagen in Tennessee April 20. What’s eye-popping about this is that the UAW succeeded not only in the South, but also with a foreign car manufacturer – a twofer. Now as the union zooms in on a May vote by 5000 workers at Mercedes in Alabama, the larger implications of Shawn Fain’s still relatively new union presidency have become clear, namely, a change in workers’ culture in the anti-union, right-to-work South; because if the UAW racks up more wins in the region, that will alter the local political ecosystem. Politicos will find themselves in an environment that includes a growing union presence, something they have sought to extirpate for generations. More

                              <span>It’s difficult to imagine an Israeli war in the Middle East that allowed any Arab country to claim victory.  The history of the Middle East over the past 75 years has been a history of war, and the Israelis have been the overwhelming victor in each and every one of them.  Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 marked an overwhelming victory for the Israelis; it created the profound antagonisms that have marked Israeli relations with the Arab states over the past 75 years.  The United States and Israel over the years have indulged in a dialogue about a “peace process,” but Arab refugees have known neither “peace” nor “process.” More

                              <span>Israel’s disregard for the negotiations and the level of its violence can be measured based on two political realities. It does not take negotiations with the Palestinians seriously and it feels that it can bomb with impunity. This is so because, firstly, Israel is backed fully by the Global North states (mainly the United States and Europe) and secondly, it does not regard Palestinian political views as vital because it has succeeded in breaking the political unity amongst Palestinians and it has succeeded in politically disorienting the various factions by the arrest of their main leadership.

                              <span>If you are a &quot;delivery driven&quot; person who cancels holidays to keep working, I would say to you, from own experience: stop being stupid.
I know, that, specially when you get recognised for the hard work it is hard, but you will regret every minute.
If you work for a company that counts on your holidays and vacation to sell their products, you are helping to create the problematic world with have today.
If many do that, more will need to do. If none do it, and act like it is an absurd to request it (and it is) nobody is forced to do it and the company is forced to do real estimates even if that hurts your fav CEO pocket</span>

                              <span>Any impressionable kids reading... this story playing out like it did is highly company-dependent, as well as luck-dependent.
In a healthy company/organization:
* That outsourcing implementation approach probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened, because an experienced person could&#x27;ve guessed how that would turn out, before it was started (it&#x27;s such a cliche).
* Earlier on, people would tell the CTO it wasn&#x27;t working out, instead of lying and saying the opposite.
* Whenever they needed to do something smarter/creative to rescue the project, they could work with the CTO on that, and maybe even with the customer.
* There wouldn&#x27;t be marathon whip-cracking over the holidays, especially not after the team was already burning out.
* A manager/lead would go to bat for the success of the project and the health of the team, and insist upwards that the team needed a break over the holidays, if that needed to be clarified.
On that last point, in a &quot;half-healthy&quot; organization, a manager might intentionally be very vague, and omit information.  That happens, and might or might not be a good idea, depending.
But the way this story is told, it sounds like the manager/lead outright lied repeatedly up the chain of command, which is generally considered very-bad, in both healthy and unhealthy companies.
I&#x27;ll add that these things are vastly easier to armchair-quarterback.  Certainly we&#x27;re all going to make mistakes, especially when put in difficult positions, and/or when overextended/fatigued.  But it helps to look at scenarios, to try to learn from them, and to think from a distance how they might&#x27;ve been handled better, so you&#x27;re armed with that &quot;experience&quot;, the next time you&#x27;re tossed into a rough situation that has some similarities.</span>

                              <span>bears and cats seem to be the only animals other than humans that are able to appreciate a good view. i saw video the other day of a bear digging himself a hole and sitting in it, onlooking a lake somewhere in the banff region. the video reminds me of the times i&#x27;d go to montenegro with my family, id dig pockets into the sand to rest my knees and stomach before laying a towel down and going to sleep. similarly, i often find my cats sitting on their cat towers outlooking the view of the lake from my balcony. genuinely good living. i always get thrown back at idea of humans getting considering as the solely &quot;intelligent&quot; animals. most of us can&#x27;t sit for a few moments and enjoy a good view, meanwhile cat and bears do it all the time. in what world does that make sense?

anyways, i&#x27;ve become a bit more lax with blogging and such. it&#x27;s been a bit of a secondary function these past few months. i get the itch at times to do small things, like write a post, or read, or research or code something. at other times, i get even worse itchings to do more drastic things, move away, quit my job, or delete every trace of myself on the internet and live like a hermit. i get annoyed quite honestly, theres always something to do or something i would like to do, and all these options cause me to paralyze myself. i find myself walking a lot these days. spending most days out of the house, which helps. a little coffee and a walk in nature helps me soothe myself. i feel like the bear in the video. a bit of a hopelessly lost almost-22 year old bear. i think time will probably tell how this all goes.</span>

I often say &#x27;machine learning in Elixir is ready for production&#x27;. On further reflection, I realised that this statement dramatically undersells the true potential and capabilities of machine learning within the Elixir ecosystem. (I already posted these reflections on Twitter).
When I say &quot;production-ready,&quot; it&#x27;s not just about the ability to deploy machine learning models in a live environment. In the context of Elixir, being production-ready means deep integration with the weird and wonderful thing called the BEAM (Bogdan/Björn&#x27;s Erlang Abstract Machine). It means seamless compatibility with OTP (Open Telecom Platfo…</span>

                              <span>Following the GA release of Gateway API last October, Kubernetes
SIG Network is pleased to announce the v1.1 release of
Gateway API. In this release, several features are graduating to
Standard Channel (GA), notably including support for service mesh and
GRPCRoute. We&#x27;re also introducing some new experimental features, including
session persistence and client certificate verification.

Graduation to Standard
This release includes the graduation to Standard of four eagerly awaited features.
This means they are no longer experimental concepts; inclusion in the Standard
release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and
provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other
Kubernetes API, Standard Channel features can continue to evolve w…</span>

This surge, often referred to as the Great Resignation, or the Great Reshuffle, was uncommonly large for an economic expansion. In this post, we call attention to a related labor market change that has not been previously highlighted—a persistent change in retirement expectations, with workers reporting much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67. This decline is particularly notable for female workers and lower-income workers.</span>

                              <span>In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It&#x27;s not poetic; it&#x27;s real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here&#x27;s the truth about living as a paradox:
I&#x27;m drawn to happiness, sure, but I can&#x27;t shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I&#x27;m stuck in the middle.
I&#x27;m not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there&#x27;s a begrudging respect for the person I&#x27;ve become, scars and all.
When I say &quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It&#x27;s just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.
Attention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I&#x27;m just not used to being seen.
I&#x27;ve been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I&#x27;ve tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.
Listening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m great at keeping other people&#x27;s secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I&#x27;d rather keep them locked away.
So yeah, I&#x27;m a walking contradiction. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s confusing, but it&#x27;s real. And maybe that&#x27;s okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life&#x27;s contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.</span>

                              <span>I thought I’d take it easy this trip to Tokyo since I didn’t plan at all. Two days in, I’ve logged 22 miles, 56,000 steps on concrete in barefoot shoes. It’s okay, though—my overworked feet will have time to recover in China. The sheer amount of walking I’ve done is testament both to how pedestrian friendly Tokyo is and to the way I still try to minmax my travels at the expense of my physical and mental health. Old habits die hard.
I wrote a while back about how one of my favorite things about traveling is getting to microdose on cluelessness. These past few days in Japan have taught me that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. The last time I was in a place where I didn’t speak the local language was seven years ago (France and Italy), and there I could at least read, if not u…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a scientist who works in protein folding (or one of those other areas) and strongly believe that science&#x27;s goal is to produce falsifiable hypotheses, these new approaches will be extremely depressing, especially if you aren&#x27;t proficient enough with ML to reproduce this work in your own hands.
If you&#x27;re a scientist who accepts that probabilist models beat interpretable ones (articulated well here: https://norvig.com/chomsky.html), then you&#x27;ll be quite happy because this is yet another validation of the value of statistical approaches in moving our ability to predict the universe forward.
If you&#x27;re the sort of person who believes that human brains are capable of understanding the &quot;why&quot; of how things work in all its true detail, you&#x27;ll find this an interesting challenge- can we actually interpret these models, or are human brains too feeble to understand complex systems without sophisticated models?
If you&#x27;re the sort of person who likes simple models with as few parameters as possible, you&#x27;re probably excited because developing more comprehensible or interpretable models that have equivalent predictive ability is a very attractive research subject.
(FWIW, I&#x27;m in the camp of &quot;we should simultaneously seek simpler, more interpretable models, while also seeking to improve native human intelligence using computational augmentation&quot;)</span>

                              <span>Stepping back, the high-order bit here is an ML method is beating physically-based methods for accurately predicting the world.
What happens when the best methods for computational fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, nuclear physics are all uninterpretable ML models? Does this decouple progress from our current understanding of the scientific process - moving to better and better models of the world without human-interpretable theories and mathematical models / explanations? Is that even iteratively sustainable in the way that scientific progress has proven to be?
Interesting times ahead.</span>

                              <span>The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of odd to me (as someone who used to live there at its latest boom time) that nobody talks about Kansas City when it comes to this topic.
From the ~70&#x27;s until the early 2010&#x27;s Kansas City&#x27;s downtown was in a similar &quot;doom loop&quot; of crime, undevelopment, decaying historic buildings, etc... In that city 75% of the metro lives in suburbs, drives in to downtown for work and promptly leaves. Until about 2012 or so. Urban redevelopment kicked in, adding (free!) transit, boosting retail, arts district events, a new stadium, and crucially - *massive office to housing conversion projects*.
There are tons of success stories like the historic Fidelity Tower at 909 Walnut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909_Walnut), a huge 35-story tower that sat vacant (creepy) for the better part of a decade and is now home to 159 units. Ditto with the Power &amp; Light Building (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Power_and_Light_Bu...) (36 stories) - largely vacant for the better part of 20 years and now home to nearly 300 units. I could go on, every block has similar projects of 100+ year old buildings of nontrivial sizes that are now super unique apartments. I myself lived in the 30-story Commerce Tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Tower) for a while and it was incredibly cheap to do so (~$1100/month for 750sqft 1 bed on the 14th floor), I had a 10 minute commute by foot to my office, it was awesome. Even the more squat, broad midsize banking buildings have had major success with residential conversions.
These kinds of conversions have been proven out when there is willpower to do so at the city level - people will move in and prices typically get competitive fast if done at scale. I&#x27;ve lived in SF for 4 years now and I&#x27;m convinced its a policy problem not an economic problem.</span>

Their primary business goal is to sell hardware. Yes, they’ve diversified into services and being a shopping mall for all, but it is about selling luxury hardware.

                              <span>Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI.
In case it is not abundantly clear by now: Apple&#x27;s AI strategy is to put inference (and longer term even learning) on edge devices. This is completely coherent with their privacy-first strategy (which would be at odds with sending data up to the cloud for processing).
Processing data at the edge also makes for the best possible user experience because of the complete independence of network connectivity and hence minimal latency.
If (and that&#x27;s a big if) they keep their APIs open to run any kind of AI workload on their chips it&#x27;s a strategy that I personally really really welcome as I don&#x27;t want the AI future to be centralised in the hands of a few powerful cloud providers.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Conventional wisdom is that only certain office buildings can be converted to housing.
If you can buy the building cheap enough, conventional wisdom can be thrown out the window.
I once toured a building that had been converted from an old warehouse to residential.  Huge floorplate.  They had built the condo units around the edges, created a hallway, and then the inside was divided up into &quot;storage&quot; spaces.  Each condo owned the space directly across the hallway.  They were very large, and people had transformed them into offices, arcades, workshops, playrooms, theaters, etc.  You could do just about anything you wanted with the space, and because it wasn&#x27;t &quot;living space&quot; you didn&#x27;t have to worry so much about noise and the property taxes were lower than they otherwise would have been.
You can&#x27;t sell it for a price that includes that space as &quot;living space&quot; either.  Which goes back to the point - if you can buy the building cheap enough, you can make anything work.</span>

I went to a private &quot;college prep&quot; high school, and the amount of assigned, mandatory reading was insane. I spent so much time reading assigned novels that I just didn&#x27;t have time to read for pleasure. (And why read for pleasure if I already spent 30+ minutes reading a boring / awful novel as part of my homework?)
Once I was out of college, I rediscovered reading.</span>

The bridge is assembled over 2 nights at a motorway exit (so traffic can bypass it by driving off and immediately back on to the road). During night 1 the two end ramps are assembled and attached together to make a short bridge. During night 2 the ramps are driven apart, the central section is built to reach the full length and the entire structure is driven to the final location.
The entire length is 236 meters long providing a working length of 100 meters underneath. The assembled bridge can flex slightly at the joins between sections, and has a turning radius of 2 kilometers.</span>

                              <span>&quot;With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon’s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power.&quot;
That&#x27;s an incredible improvement in just a few years. I wonder how much of that is Apple engineering and how much is TSMC improving their 3nm process.</span>

                              <span>Recently I discovered that many coffee shops, maybe half in my sampling of a couple dozen in different cities, are selling cold coffee (brewed hot, then refrigerated) under the name cold brew, and even the ones that actually cold-brew them seem to be under the impression that it needs to be served cold. I was laughed at in one hipster joint for asking for a steamed or warmed cold-brew, and another one initially refused my request to warm it up saying that would make the coffee extremely sour. (It didn’t) Oh, and at least one other, maybe two, said they couldn’t warm cold brew (in view of both a steamer and microwave) or would have to charge extra (while someone’s cheaper latte was being steamed).
Reading the paper, it’s not clear whether their cold brew has lower acidity (higher pH) than the same coffee hot brewed. It does say that the sonic-brew has the same pH as the normal long-steep cold brew. I’m also curious if this cavitation/sonication brewing process is basically agitating the coffee, or doing something different, and how different it is from manually agitating a cold brew compared to letting it sit still for hours.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40281352">

                              <span>Private equity is akin to toxic poison for everyone who isn&#x27;t one of the (very few) general partners who bask in obscene amounts of scrooge-mcduck money.  Think of making a cool $30 million+ a quarter, per partner -- thanks real estate (and apparently, emergency medical services) &quot;investments&quot;!  This is a direct funnel to syphon money from the workers to the ruling class.  That&#x27;s even more cash than the top brass at FAAGs make.
How can this phenomenon be reigned in and sorted in the medium to long-term?
It&#x27;s a loss for everyone (99.9999%) except the miniscule quantity of winners (0.0001%, yes, that&#x27;s 1 in 1,000,000 - there aren&#x27;t that many large-scale P/E firms).  Housing owned by P/E couldn&#x27;t be more soul sucking.  Scratch that, this applies to every case I&#x27;m aware of where P/E firms own a thing.
Anecdote: Last month my dear old dog was suddenly very ill and I spent $12k on emergency surgery to save his sweet life.  No regrets, I&#x27;m grateful he was fixable.  But in the waiting room I did the conservative math for what the SAGE Emergency Veterinary Hospital in Redwood City, CA makes in a year (before the comparatively small overhead, tax-deductible expenses) and they are pulling in at least $30 million in this single location.  That&#x27;s.. a lot, for many 20 total staff.  Also they charged me $500 for each follow-up visit, which is way more than my real life surgeon charged me earlier this year! (Even including insurance, he didn&#x27;t charge much for the follow-ups to make sure I survived.)  Damn.
For the dog lovers out there: Doggo is alive and well, can maybe last another year or two we hope.
Btw, who owns SAGE?  NVA, a P/E firm.

I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I&#x27;ve gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I&#x27;ve stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.
When I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I&#x27;m not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert. Honestly, if a person had a spiritual exploration in the desert for 40 days, …</span>

While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not. Indeed, job shortfalls remain in more than a quarter of the country’s metro areas, including many in the New York-Northern New Jersey region. In fact, while employment is well above pre-pandemic levels in Northern New Jersey, jobs have only recently recovered in and around New York City, and most of upstate New York—like much of the Rust Belt—still has not fully recovered and has some of the largest job shortfalls in the country.</span>

                              <span>The U.S. housing market has had a tumultuous few years. After falling to record lows during the pandemic, the average 30-year mortgage rate rapidly increased in 2022 and 2023 and now hovers near a two-decade high of 7.2 percent. For those that locked in a low mortgage rate prior to 2022, this steep increase has significantly increased the cost of moving, as taking out a mortgage at current rates would potentially increase their monthly housing payment by hundreds or thousands of dollars, even if the amount they borrowed remained unchanged. As shown by Ferreira et al. (2011), this lock-in effect has the potential to reduce geographic mobility and turnover in the housing market and has gained the attention of  Federal Reserve leaders. In this post, we utilize special questions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys to estimate the extent to which mortgage rate lock-in is suppressing U.S. household’s moving plans.</span>

                              <span>&quot;and block its websites.&quot; So this keeps Israelis from reading Al Jazeera.
Now that&#x27;s new. Israel started Internet censorship in 2017.[1] Initially it was limited to &quot;terror group websites, online illegal gambling, prostitution services, hard drug sales&quot;. At the time, &quot;due to warnings from rights groups that the law poses a slippery slope toward additional censorship, the final version of the legislation dictates that rights groups may appeal the decisions.&quot;
Then, in 2021, there was the &quot;Facebook bill&quot;, authorizing very broad censorship.[2] That does not seem to have passed. It was first proposed in 2016, almost passed in 2018 [3], tried in 2021, and tried again in 2022. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have passed.
But something new happened recently. Wikipedia has a note at Censorship in Israel: &quot;This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: New ban issued by the knesset on foreign media channels. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2024)&quot;[4]
The Knesset gave the government the authority to ban foreign media on April 1, 2024.[5]
This isn&#x27;t just about preventing outside media from reporting from Israel. It keeps Israelis from viewing media the government doesn&#x27;t like. Haarez has good coverage.[6]
The US White House press secretary issued a weak statement condemning Israel&#x27;s action, but it was on April 1st and the costumed Easter Bunny overshadowed that statement.[7]

They always seemed very &quot;1984&quot; to me, and almost designed to engender resentment in a way that would ultimately backfire. So perhaps I&#x27;m in a like-minded echo chamber, but is there anyone that actually defends these DEI statements with a coherent argument, or can you point me to one online? If so, I&#x27;d honestly love to hear it, and I mean this quite genuinely. I did some googling beforehand and found loads of &quot;how to write a good DEI statement&quot; articles, but literally every single one of them just took it at face value that these were a good thing to begin with (or, perhaps in their defense, that &quot;academic jobs require it&quot;, so you better learn how to write one in any case).</span>

                              <span>Traefik is pretty cool, but suffers from the same, terrible problem of Ansible: there is a lot of documentation, and a lot of words written, yet you can never find anything you need.
I have used it since v1 and I routinely get lost in their docs, and get immensely frustrated. I have been using Caddy for smaller projects simply because its documentation is not as terrible (though not great by any stretch)
Technical writers: documentation by example is good only for newbies skimming through. People familiar with your product need a reference and exhaustive lists, not explanation for different fields spread over 10 tutorial pages. Focus on those that use the product day in and day out, not solely on the &quot;onboarding&quot; procedure.
This is my pet peeve and the reason why I hate using Ansible so damn much, and Traefik to a lesser extent.</span>

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been able to watch anything lately like animes, youtube videos, dramas, movies, documentaries etc.
Watching feels just too slow for me. If I read, I can consume the content with my preference of pace. That&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t do with watching. Yes, I can speed up the video most of the time but it is still not enough.
It is not like I read super fast by the way. I&#x27;m a quite average reader in terms of speed. Reading just feels more personal, internalizable and absorbable.
It&#x27;s probably because reading is an active process while watching is a passive process.
The important thing is that I realized this reality within myself and I decided to reduce watching videos. So I&#x27;ve been purposely avoiding watching videos for awhile now. I can say that consuming contents in reading format is much more better.</span>

Sometimes something comes out of it, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. But I keep doing it in one form or another. Because...
It&#x27;s easier to keep going than to get started.
I find it more motivating to do it publicly - even if no one reads it. It adds a bit of healthy &quot;pressure&quot;. And it&#x27;s more fun, especially with nice tools like Bear blog.
But it doesn&#x27;t matter how you do it.
Write on a piece of paper, your phone, a computer, or whatever. Write spontaneously or thoughtfully, in depth or effective, personal or general. Write a sentence, 500 characters, or three pages.
It doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s all up to you. There&#x27;s no contest, and there&#x27;s no right or wrong.
Just keep writing...</span>

I don&#x27;t know exactly when this happened, but I think things haven&#x27;t been good for a while now. My mom and her siblings are intentionally very vague; they haven&#x27;t even told my grandparents. I understand not wanting to spook the parents but don&#x27;t know if I agree. I know I would want to know as soon as possible if my firstborn were on death&#x27;s doorstep.
My uncle&#x27;s been smoking since before I was born, so it&#x27;s not like we couldn&#x27;t have foreseen this coming. But I think my grandpa doing the same without issue well into his eighties lulled us all into a false sense of security. The timing stunned me, not least because we found out at com…</span>

                              <span>The best advice I got in college was from a senior. &quot;Pick the teacher not the course&quot; he told me. This was contrary to the general method. Everyone picked a course based on how lenient the grading was or interest.
I respected the guy so decided to follow his advice. I chose &#x27;Computational Complexity&#x27; as an elective. A subject I had no interest in. The Prof was known for strict grading and the material was supposed to be really tough. It was all theory. No practical coding. On paper it was the worst choice I could have made. It turned out to be the best course I ever took.
In my college you can sit for am elective course for first week or two before committing to it. Kind of like window shopping for knowledge. So I decided to check the course out. I knew nothing about it. Had no interest as well. It quickly changed. The Prof teaching it had a passion that was infectious. He would encourage doubts. If someone asked something silly he would say &quot;ah! it seems trivial on the face of it but reveals deeper complexities&quot; with a happy glint in his eyes. There were no stupid questions in his class. So I chose the teacher not the course. Going with my gut and my seniors advice against all common sense. Only 11 other people in the entire college took the course.
I had the most fun in those classes. Learned so much. Fell in love with formal proof writing. Had my mind blown several times. The extra class hours spend absorbing the material, making my way through new proofs felt effortless.
It taught me a lesson that I always keep in mind. Environment matters. The people you surround yourself with matter. Whether in work or personal life. Anything can become interesting, profound and world changing if done with right people.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m soon traveling to Seattle for work. Surprisingly, I&#x27;m more anxious about this trip than seems reasonable, and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve traveled, nor is it even the first time I&#x27;ve gone to Seattle for work. It&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;m going there. Now that I think about it, I can see how the first time was kind of traumatizing in some ways. Perhaps talking about it would help me work through it.
Let&#x27;s start from the beginning...
Last time I went, I flew from my country to Mexico City, and then from there to Seattle. I took the same route on the way back. Overall, it was fairly quick and was by far the best option offered by the travel agency that the company I work for uses (all the other routes were waaay longer or had a lot more legs).
My way there was... o…</span>

Painful disinflation is and always has been about getting wage inflation down. Forget payroll employment, the big news […]

                              <span>I have always been lazy and ambitious. My life mostly has been a weird experiment in combining the two. Being ambitious means I want to achieve a lot, something that required hard work. Being lazy means, well I would rather not work hard.
And no this is not some post about smart work. I never understood smart work anyways. It assumes people are dumb and don&#x27;t know how to approach problems from high leverage points. I am not sure if any of these people even exist when you are competing at a high level.
Competing at a high level means you are up against smart crazy human beings willing to burn everything including themselves. You have to grind hard to have a shot. So I had to solve my hard work issue.
I soon realised that my issue was not hard work. It was work that &#x27;felt&#x27; like hard work. I can just program the wet squishy computer between my skull to change the &#x27;feeling&#x27; settings. So hard work feels like a breeze. Even extremely enjoyable.
How can this programming be done? Well the key insight is you can bore yourself to a point that anything is enjoyable. Also you can gaslight yourself into making any mundane task feel grand. So what looks like mundane paperwork to someone on the outside could feel like the holy act of putting ink on paper and rewriting history to you. You get my point right?
Everyone has a different brain and how you programme this squishy thing will be personal to you. Just spend time with yourself. Introspect to read the documentation.
Be the cracked self programmer you need to be!</span>

                              <span>in this world, we met much later than usual. college roommates, at the cusp of graduation, in an apartment that resembled the 2nd floor of one the many homes i&#x27;ve left behind. i don&#x27;t remember what you were studying this time around, but your room was always filled with music and the murmur of your friends&#x27; voices.
we lived like strangers for the most part. our schedules never coincided. we were never home at the same time. we spoke infrequently and only via alphabet magnets on our fridge.
&quot;fod here&quot;, &quot;tysm&quot;, &quot;rain tom&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;was loud?&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;
then finally — an intersection. carpooling home from a mutual friend&#x27;s party, squished together in the back seat. i was nodding off and you guided my head to your shoulder. i tell you that it&#x27;s been a while since i&#x27;ve seen you, so you promise to develop a habit of forgetting your keys.
from there, it blurs together. the bump of the road, the hair on my cheek, the itch of your sweater, the gentle hand on my thigh.
i know i&#x27;m meant to love you in every lifetime we meet.</span>

                              <span>The increasing dominance of large firms in the United States has raised concerns about pricing power in the product market. The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span>

In the morning we went out to a breakfast place, courtesy of our host. When the waitress took our orders, I watched as my coworkers and hosts each ordered a cup of coffee along with their food. During breakfast, they talked about how important coffee is to a scientific workplace.
At our institute, there is a single set of coffee machines on the top floor, set up to encourage interactions among scientists.
When scientists take social breaks, it&#x27;s often coded as &quot;coffee break&quot;. One scientist even wrote an opinion piece encouraging more socialization in science through coffee breaks.
The problem is that I don&#x27;t drink coffee. Honestly, I barely take in caffeine. I used to drink black tea in the morning irregularly, then I tried …</span>

                              <span>The Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
acts as the main connection between the kubelet
and the Container Runtime.
Those runtimes have to provide a gRPC server which has to
fulfill a Kubernetes defined Protocol Buffer interface.
This API definition
evolves over time, for example when contributors add new features or fields are
going to become deprecated.
In this blog post, I&#x27;d like to dive into the functionality and history of three
extraordinary Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are truly outstanding in
terms of how they work: Exec, Attach and PortForward.
Exec can be used to run dedicated commands within the container and stream
the output to a client like kubectl or
crictl. It also allows interaction with
that process using standard input (stdin), for example if users want t…</span>

                              <span>With the release of Kubernetes 1.30, the feature to prevent the modification of the volume mode
of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

I thought that instead of typing up another rant, I&#x27;d do something a bit different. I want to share a little anecdote with you.
Around 20 years ago, I joined the British Army; right at the height of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.
Yeah, I&#x27;ve never been the sharpest tool in the box.
Anyway, Iraq was shit. I lost a couple of friends, more were badly hurt, and I myself suffered a minor shrapnel wound.
It&#x27;s fair to say that I saw shit out there that no-one should ever see. I finished my tour of Iraq and less than a year later I found myself in Afghanistan.
For me, Afghan was marginally better than Iraq. I won&#x27;t go into detail as to why as that could reveal who I am, but suffice to say, it wasn&#x27;t quite as shit as Iraq.
I got back from Afghan and I was fucked. Not physically though. Mentally. The Army might spin this yarn that they give their troops the help they need, but the fact of the matter is, if you went to the &quot;Med Centre&quot; claiming you were having mental health problems, you&#x27;d quickly become a laughing stock of the battalion.
You&#x27;d be labelled a pussy. A fanny. Not tough enough be a soldier.
Note: This might not be the case anymore. It&#x27;s been a long time since I served, but that&#x27;s what it was like then I was serving.
So I didn&#x27;t get help, and it utterly fucked me. I was having nightmares. I was taking it out on my loved ones. I was all over the show.
Then my (now) wife convinced me to go see a professional to help me process some of this baggage.
I did, and it really helped. Actually, it was one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done. Do I still have demons? Yes. Do I let them affect my life? For the most part, no.
So, my message to you is - whether you&#x27;re a soldier, a police officer, a fire fighter, a janitor, an office worker, or anything else - if you have shit going on upstairs, don&#x27;t let it fester. Go and see someone about it. Someone impartial, who can just listen and help you process that shit.
You can thank me later.
Peace. ✌️

The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking

                              <span>Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a type of AI used to generate content, including conversations, images, videos, and music. Generative AI can be used directly to build customer-facing features (a chatbot or an image generator), or it can serve as an underlying component in a more complex system. For example, it can generate embeddings […]</span>

As expected, there were no changes to the neoliberal policies promoted and imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions. A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

validating admission webhooks, it may be interesting to read our
previous post about the new feature.
If you have already heard about ValidatingAdmissionPolicies and you are eager to try them out,
there is no better time to do it than now.
Let&#x27;s have a taste of a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, by replacing a simple webhook.
Example admission webhook
First, let&#x27;s take a look at an example of a simple webhook. Here is an excerpt from a webhook that

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>
