&gt;    - Session management

                              <span>I&#x27;m amused that neither the LLM or the author identified one of the simplest and most effective optimizations for this code: Test if the number is  max _before_ doing the digit sum. It&#x27;s a free 5.5x speedup that renders some of the other optimizations, like trying to memoize digit sums, unnecessary.
On an m1 macbook pro, using numpy to generate the random numbers, using mod/div to do digit sum:
Base: 55ms
Test before digit sum: 7-10ms, which is pretty close to the numba-optimized version from the post with no numba and only one line of numpy. Using numba slows things down unless you want to do a lot of extra work of calculating all of the digit sums in advance (which is mostly wasted).
The LLM appears less good at identifying the big-o improvements than other things, which is pretty consistent with my experience using them to write code.</span>

This may be an underestimation, as Psychiatric News reported later in 2024, “More than 1,500 intravenous (IV) infusion clinics have proliferated nationwide.” Ketamine industry revenues of $3.1 billion were reported in 2022, and projected to be $6.9 billion by 2030.

                              <span>One of the reasons I’m having difficulty “enjoying the holidays” is the editorial writing of Bret Stephens.  His columns defending Israel’s brutal military campaign that targets sanctuary areas and so-called safe zones in Gaza are typically chauvinistic and bellicose.  Stephens supports any Israeli military option that “advances Israel’s national interests on all fronts.”  His lecture at Harvard last year argued that “taking out most, but not all, of Hamas is not enough,” which seems to justify the genocidal campaign that Israel conducts.  Stephens has never mentioned that this campaign targets Gaza’s hospitals and health infrastructure.  As for those who protest Israeli actions, Stephens calls them “Iran’s useful idiots” and anti-semites.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think you have to have Fuck You Money to get to this point. Most people eventually become disillusioned with work enough that they reevaluate what matters to them. Getting a very profitable exit is just one way to trigger that experience.
In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I&#x27;m not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It&#x27;s a way of taking back control.
When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I&#x27;ve nurtured...a lot more than what I&#x27;ve built, in most ways. I&#x27;ve heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like &quot;I now enjoy making other people rich.&quot;
No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.</span>

I think his problem is his identity (founder of Loom) suddenly disappeared.
Now he needs to develop a new identity.
This is especially difficult for single founders without kids (in the sense that people with spouse/kids already derive much of their identity from those 2 things).
Selling a company isn’t all that different from going through a divorce (in the sense that your identity needs to be completely rebuilt from scratch)</span>

That&#x27;s a CAN-SPAM act violation.
FTC: &quot;Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.&quot;[1]
Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.
The actual regulation text:
§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.
Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient&#x27;s electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:
(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or
(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).
That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.

One that&#x27;s centered around &quot;you&quot; and filled with thousands/millions of LLM bots praising you, treating you like a celebrity, etc. Each of your posts will get tens of thousands of &quot;likes&quot;, hundreds of comments, etc. Dm&#x27;s straight to your feed, people wanting you, etc etc.
If the newsfeed is already mostly &quot;the algorithm&quot;, might as well take it to the extreme. I bet tons of people would get addicted to the dopamine hit of celebrity status (whether it&#x27;s bots or not).</span>

Rejection from journals is like rejection from VCs -- it happens all the time and often not for any good reason.

                              <span>Hilarious irony:
&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an &quot;epsilon loss&quot; in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.
&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!</span>

Thank you to every one of you who has made HN among the most intellectually dense places on the web -- I wouldn&#x27;t be where I&#x27;m today without reading all the insightful comments, submitted links and perspectives of all the HN-ers over the last 7 years.
My wish for the new year: hopefully, AI singularity is still a few years away and doesn&#x27;t happen in 2025!</span>

                              <span>I built and run a saas product solo (&gt; $500k/year). Honestly, I have never found any advice useful. I&#x27;ve been to saas founder meetups (like microconf), I&#x27;ve read the books, etc.
Any advice I give may not apply to you and your business. My business is b2b and it&#x27;s a platform for certain kinds of professionals as well as an API that powers many well known businesses.
I&#x27;ve only had success through two general strategies:
1. Networking (friend of friends, friend of customers, etc). Leverage your network to find more customers.
2. The &quot;Long Game&quot; (SEO, word of mouth, etc). This is where I get most of my customers.
I&#x27;d say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc). Use networking to determine how valuable the product is and if people give a damn about it. If no one wants to talk to you about it, no one is going to want to pay for it.</span>

Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t be too critical of Mozilla for providing a privacy-first LLM service - for free. The other big privacy-first LLM provider is Apple, which requires users to have their devices/subscriptions to use, and definitely uses advanced telemetry by default.
Not to speak of all the other providers who are either paid or free-but-mine-your-data.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Credit card delinquency rates, which are seen as a precursor to write-offs, peaked in July, according to data from Moody’s, but have only fallen slightly and remain nearly a percentage point higher than they were on average in the year before the pandemic.
This is a prime example of a style of reporting that really grinds my gears.
The citation is clearly to another internet source, so a link should be provided. If it truly cannot be linked because it is private, more context is still needed to understand what this data means.
I actually can’t find the source myself, but I can find “Delinquency Rate on Credit Card Loans, All Commercial Banks” from the Federal Reserve. [1]
The percents from that source somewhat match those referenced in the FT quote. “Peaked in July”
- 2024Q1 3.15%
- 2024Q2 3.24%
- 2024Q3 3.23%
Using 2019 as “the year before the pandemic”, the average was 2.5825. Is +0.6475 “nearly a percentage point”? I guess it technically would round up.
Seemingly important context that the quote doesn’t give is that 3.23% is lower than any time 1991Q3 to 2011Q4. But, maybe the trend matters more for this metric.

                              <span>I worked with John for a few years in the 1990s. This was during the heyday of BBSes, when he joined our small team at Mustang Software after Mustang bought Qmodem. John moved to Bakersfield California (with his family, including OP!) to be with us. John left a few years later due to I think business differences with management.
John was personable and full of joy. He always loved a good joke. I remember the parties (not wild, we were pretty tame back then) we would have around the pool at his place. He was generous with his time.
The story of Qmodem itself was a bit different. Qmodem for DOS was a one-man shareware business and was John&#x27;s pride and joy. It was clear that he poured everything into that program. It was finely tuned and just worked. Times were changing though, and people were calling for a Windows version. Unfortunately, John was not interested in learning Windows programming, so Scott Hunter (now at Microsoft), Dan Horn, and I built Qmodem for Windows. It was good, but it really never had the same level of polish that John&#x27;s work did. It was &quot;Qmodem&quot; in name only.
After John left Mustang he also left Bakersfield and I lost touch with him. I&#x27;m sure he continued to make the people around him smile. Thank you for your time and contributions, John.</span>
