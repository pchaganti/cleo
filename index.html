 The first impression produced upon a stranger by a village in Great Russia is undoubtedly gloomy. The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive.

 Much has been written lately in condemnation of the free libraries, on the ground that they were chiefly used by those who cared only for light reading, and that the more serious books were rarely in demand. It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels.

 THE Russian educated woman is known to some extent in this country for the part which she took in the struggles for political freedom. Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. 
 If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…</span>

 THE necessity of growing more foodstuffs in this country has perhaps never been so evident as it is now. That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming? Could not, let us say, several County Councils, especially in those counties where there are patches of a lighter soil, establish a number of sm…</span>

 The train had just arrived at the station of N—–, an out-of-the-way place on one of the branches of the South-Eastern system. The few travellers alighted—three men and a woman—and stood on the platform, waiting till the way was deal- to cross to the other side and make their way out. 
 The men belonged in the vicinity and knew each other. They talked together, while the woman—a young brunette, thin and poorly dressed in black—stood apart, leaning on the railing. Her eyes roved over the surrounding country and seemed to s…</span>

                              <span>I bought into the hype and I feel bad for the company where I implemented it. One true endpoint to rule them all and cause endless headaches in the process.
With most tech that I screw up I assume that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t using it right&quot; but with GraphQL I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could. The permissions/auth aspect alone is a nightmare. Couple that with potential performance issues (N+1 or just massive amounts of data) and I want nothing to do with GraphQL anymore. Everything we attempted to fix our permissions issues just caused more problems. It would break existing queries and debugging GraphQL sucked so much.
If you only live on the frontend and someone else is responsible for the backend GraphQL then I understand why you might like it. From that perspective it&#x27;s amazing, you can get as little or as much as you want with the specific fields you want. No waiting on the backend team to write an endpoint. However even then you end up saving queries as files or abstracting them (maybe IDE support has improved but it wasn&#x27;t great last time I was using it ~5 years ago) and now you just have REST endpoints by another name.
At one point we considered whitelisting specific queries and that&#x27;s when I knew we had gone too far and made a mess for ourselves. If we had taken the time to just write REST endpoints instead we would have gotten way more done and had way fewer grey hairs.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s important to remember that all best practices are not created equal. I&#x27;d prioritize readability over DRY. I&#x27;d prioritize cohesion over extensibility. When people talk about best practices, they don&#x27;t talk about how a lot of them are incompatible, or at least at odds with each other. Writing code is about choosing the best practices you want to prioritize as much as it&#x27;s about avoiding bad practices.</span>

At 24 I ended up as the chair of a not for profit that stood on top of $30 million of real estate _because no one else wanted to_. Getting quorum was impossible because we needed three out of five board members to show up to a meeting.
People have this idea it&#x27;s mustache twirling villains running these things. It&#x27;s usually the idiot thats about to burn out.</span>

                              <span>I ran a multi-million dollar a year non-profit and had a full-time job. It&#x27;s not unusual to chair or &quot;run&quot; a non-profit and have a regular job, non-profits are actually set up to make this easy to do. If that non-profit somehow mystically turned into a for-profit enterprise, for a multitude of reasons (some less obvious) I would have clearly had to pick one or the other. If said non-profit had commercialized transformer as a service, I&#x27;d have quit DigitalOcean (double so if I was well vested).
Just to make it fair with the situation: I honestly don&#x27;t know if I would have proactively quit one or the other. Depending on the workloads, I may very well have tried to moonlight both for a while, I&#x27;m unsure.
I don&#x27;t think this tweet by Paul is weird at all.</span>

                              <span>Worked on two GraphQL projects; I was quickly cured from the hype. I recognize a lot of points in this article.
In both these projects the GraphQL had started small. I came in during a more mature phase of these projects (2 and 4 years). That&#x27;s where the requirements are harder, more specific, and overall complexity has grown. Adoption and demand on the API were growing quickly. Hence you logically spend more time debugging, this is true for any codebase.
But GraphQL has everything in it to make such problems even harder. And both these projects had clear signs of &quot;learning-on-the-go&quot; with loads of bad practices (especially for the N+1 problem). Issue descriptions were much vaguer, harder to find in logs and performance issues popped up in the most random places (code that had been running and untouched for ages).
Fun fact; in both these projects the original devs who set it up were no longer involved. Probably spreading their evangalism further elsewhere.
RPC and REST are just more straightforward to monitor, log, cache, authorize and debug.</span>

                              <span>This seems silly. It’s been obvious even to casual observers like myself for years that Waymo/Google was one of the only groups taking the problem seriously and trying to actually solve it, as opposed to pretending you could add self-driving with just cameras in an over-the-air update (Tesla), or trying to move fast and break things (Uber), or pretending you could gradually improve lane-keeping all the way into autonomous driving (car manufacturers). That’s why it’s working for them. (IIUC, Cruise has pretty much also always been legit?)
Don’t even get me started on the “didn’t take psych 102: Attention and Memory”-level cluelessness required to believe a human can safely pay attention well enough in a vehicle that reliably tricks you into believing it’s autonomous to take over in the split seconds before a disaster…
I find it hard to believe that the Tesla and Auto Manufacturer positions aren’t knowingly deceptive. I mean, what are they going to say? “It’s too hard so we’re just waiting for Waymo or Cruise to license their tech once it works”?
I’m gonna stop here before I start mocking geohot… I seriously can’t believe the journalists who wrote those early stories were willing to risk their lives like that…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not normally a person thankful for life. I&#x27;ve been existing, not living, for a long time. I wake up, do what I have to do to keep my scholarship and my body in decent condition, and go to sleep. Repeat. My days have a rhythm I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy, because college life is the same stressful day over and over again, with a little respite here and there. And it&#x27;s like, God, I&#x27;m 20 years old. I should be at the club.
But life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don&#x27;t know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend. Being able to take it slow in the morning, enough to think about things like this, is rare.
I&#x27;m alive. That&#x27;s something.</span>

                              <span>I recently read Kristin&#x27;s post where she notes that a lot of blogs have a very serious tone to them, and laughed because it was something I clocked too, at least in my own posting behavior recently!
I think I naturally like to reflect, but I&#x27;d noticed that whenever I came on here, I found myself endeavoring to write Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter1, because a lot of the posts I read were (either intentionally or naturally) Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I&#x27;m happy for the reminder to unclench. Honestly, I personally prefer reading the day-to-day, thesis-less stuff myself.2

                              <span>I recently came across a tweet that rubbed me the wrong way.
It stated: &quot;Mediocre people often have a clear tell: you&#x27;ll often see them hanging out with other mediocre people, probably because the A+ folks avoid them.&quot;
This reeks of the kind of elitist, self-congratulatory attitude that plagues certain circles. Who determines what makes someone &quot;mediocre&quot; or an &quot;A+&quot;? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.
Excellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don&#x27;t just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of &quot;A+ folks.&quot; The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.
Perhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...
 and I&#x27;ve all fallen for the bait.</span>

This topic is always so alarmist.  I have kids and a spouse.  We all have Find My and Location Sharing on our phones.  I don&#x27;t FrEaK oUt that my kids are going to die if I&#x27;m not tracking their every movement.  But it&#x27;s nice to glance at Find My app and see if the kids are still hanging out at Starbucks or they got to school on time.  It&#x27;s convenient to see which corner of the park they&#x27;re at when I need to go pick them up.  I can see if my wife&#x27;s still at Whole Foods and send her a message to pick up baru nuts.  They can see if I&#x27;m still at work or headed home.
This idea of helicopter parents vs free-range glory is a false dichotomy.</span>

                              <span>Reminds of of the replacement of &quot;threeks&quot; at the UW-Madison campus in the 1980s. At the time, it was common for satirical parties to win student elections and do odd things like cover the campus with plastic flamingos. One of the satirical parties was upset that the UW-Madison cafeteria didn&#x27;t have true forks (with four tines) but only &quot;threeks&quot; (forks with three tines). So they decided to work with friends at Northwestern university outside Chicago to trade their cafeteria&#x27;s forks for UW&#x27;s threeks. They were successful, but obviously both UW&#x27;s and Northwestern&#x27;s administration weren&#x27;t pleased and the trade was reversed.</span>

This constant tracking of kids is unnecessary and dangerous. Generations of kids survived without their parents needing to know their location at all times.
And yes, I totally admit, some kids (very few actually depending on the locale) didn&#x27;t survive. But we&#x27;ve traded this false sense of &quot;safety&quot; for kids that are so risk averse it is seriously negatively affecting their development. I highly recommend the writings of Jonathan Haidt - he not only has great arguments but also has a lot of data to back up his conclusions.
Kids don&#x27;t need more tech, they need less of it (and FWIW, most adults, too).</span>

                              <span>This mindset assumes that the only measure of success is monetary. If he left Google to try and get richer than staying at Google, then sure, he probably lost.
However, he kept trying again before job hunting or returning to big tech. This tells me the monetary factor was smaller than something else.
You mention the underrated educational experience in your last sentence, but there&#x27;s so much more than that. He was probably never worried about his autonomy, being laid off, working with (or for) people he didn&#x27;t want to work with, corporate politics, or anything else corporate bureaucracy introduces. This likely freed up his brain to be more creative and actually be used to 100% of its capacity.
I believe the obsession with TC in tech is highly problematic and there are a lot of talented folks optimizing for promotions via internal politics, rather than solving real problems for real people.
I also wish healthcare wasn&#x27;t tied to employment, but that&#x27;s a post for another time.</span>

Unfortunately, while we had a QA person on this, and nearly 100 beta testers, the iPhone camera APIs are a mine field. We’ll get a fix out as soon as we have details.</span>

There seems to be an exclusion for using the code outputs as part of &quot;development&quot;. But wait! It also prohibits &quot;any internal usage by employees in the context of the company&#x27;s business activities&quot;.

They only compare to other open-weight models, not GPT-4 or Opus, but a normal company or individual can do whatever they want with the Llama weights and outputs.

                              <span>I could not hear anyone in any crowded situation. At middle age I thought my hearing was leaving. Yet every audiologist I went to said my hearing was fine. So  I found the best audiologist in my fairly large metro area, and scheduled a year in advance (the wait list was that long).
After a whole day of tests the audiologist comes in and says I have good news and bad news and good bad news. The good news is that my hearing was beyond great, it was at the level of a 5 year old. The bad news: I could hear so well I was unable to differentiate sound; my hearing hadn’t gotten worse, my brain’s ability to separate sound had. The good bad news is that my hearing would inevitably deteriorate, as all ours does, and for several years I’d be able hear in public places!
I think part of what has made this worse is that restaurant and public space designers have stopped thinking about sound. Most bars opened in the last 15 years have cement floors, very little sound insulation, and they’re based on the idea that you’re not having a good time unless your ears are ringing.
I’ve stopped patronizing these places if only because I literally cannot maintain conversations.</span>

In groups and with friends, it&#x27;s inevitable that you end up in a busy restaurant or a bar, and it always frustrates me that I don&#x27;t hear something, I ask the person to repeat only to not hear it again, usually because they repeat it at the same low level (considering the circumstances). Missing jokes and throwaway comments is even worse (&quot;hey what are you all laughing about, I didn&#x27;t hear it, could you repeat it for me like three times until I hear it&quot;).</span>

I think you fundamentally misunderstand the role of the board of directors. It&#x27;s often been said that the board (of any company) has basically one job: to hire (and fire) the CEO. While that may be a slight exaggeration, the wisdom behind that quote is that things turn out badly when the board meddles in decisions of a company&#x27;s executive leadership - if they don&#x27;t like the decisions being made, they should replace the CEO, and that&#x27;s where their power lies.
You talk about &quot;filing formal complaints&quot; - what does this even mean?? They&#x27;re the board, who else would they file formal complaints to? &quot;Hand off Sam&#x27;s responsibilities to other people&quot;?? Again, any corporate governance expert would say that&#x27;s a recipe for disaster, never mind not even feasible the way corporate hierarchies work.
I&#x27;ve commented many times before that I think the way the board handled the Altman&#x27;s filing was, at best, woefully naive, and their communication at the time (even after he was fired) abysmal. But neither do I think it was some sort of &quot;coup&quot;, and your recommendations simply don&#x27;t make sense.</span>

                              <span>On April 31, 300 mm of rain fell in the mountains of Northern Rio Grande do Sul, causing dam breaks, landslides and submerging entire towns, leaving over 160 people dead as it headed south towards the Guaíba drainage basin, where all of the streams and rivers of the northern third of the state converge to enter into a river that runs directly past downtown Porto Alegre. Devastated by a huge flood in 1941, the City of Porto Alegre used Dutch technology to construct a huge dike, floodgate and pumping station system in the 1960s to prevent a similar tragedy from every happening again. As the water level in the Guaíba River surpassed the 3-meter mark during the first days of May, the public found out that some of the flood gates were missing rubber seals and bolts, and many had rusted into their tracks.

                              <span>Global capitalism has produced multiple intersecting crises that are intensifying conflict between and within states. These crises are a global economic slump; sharpening interimperial rivalry between the United States, China, and Russia; climate change; unprecedented global migration; and pandemics, of which COVID-19 is only the most recent example. These crises have undermined the political establishment, caused political polarization in most countries of the world, opening the door to the Right and the Left, and triggering waves of explosive yet episodic struggles from below. We have not witnessed such a period of crisis, conflict, wars, political instability, and revolts in decades. More

                              <span>South Africa has a general election today with 28m citizens registered to vote. Since the end of the apartheid regime three decades ago, the African National Congress (ANC) has won all the elections with substantial majorities. But this time there is the possibility that the ANC will poll less than 50% of those voting.

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these (...)

It also made me realize that cURL&#x27;s default to not redirect automatically is probably intentional and is a good default. Praise be to Daniel Stenberg for this choice when implementing cURL.</span>

Title: Solidarity and its Discontents?
Subtitle: Riots, Rebellion and Repression in Bristol 2011-2023

Source: https://bangupandsmash.noblogs.org/downloads/



The media, the schools, the judges, the cops, politicians, surveillance, technology, work. All have their role to play in repression. [1]
 Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance. All these words are difficult to discuss because they combine personal experiences with repressive practices deliberatel…</span>

Killing King Abacus
 To Kill King Abacus is to create relations without measure. If we aim to destroy capitalism we cannot reproduce its necrophilic logic which reduces relationships to numbers. To Kill King Abacus is to destroy the social net which privileges mediated transactions and images over direct relations. Because money is a general equivalent and thus is nearly limitless in its applications, it conquers other signifiers of value; capitalism transforms other value systems into itself.

Title: Errico Malatesta: A Brief Biography
Date: 2020
Notes: A brief biographical statement used to preface a reader for the DSA LSC Political Education Working Group&#x27;s Malatesta Reader, which was used in a series of study circles in 2020 to explore Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Towards Anarchy,&quot; and &quot; An Anarchist Programme&quot;.

 Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Italy on 14 December 1853. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II . 
 Malatesta was introduced to Mazzinian Republicanism while studying medicine at …</span>

i watched laufey’s concert in manila today, may 28th, with my friends gabby and carmen.
i spent the whole day abuzz. it felt like everything fell right into place; i didn’t have much work that early morning because america was on a holiday. just an hour or two’s worth of tasks, then i was off to bed. i didn&#x27;t have to roll up to the venue half asleep.
i had brunch and then a smoothie, then i spent half the day putting my outfit together (see: looking through my mom&#x27;s closet for shoes).
gabby came over  with my stray kids merch (i brought bangchan with me to the concert) and we had a snack. carmen picked us up at 5:50pm and we ate at jollibee for a quick dinner. we arrived just as people were trickling into the concert hall.

                              <span>Recently, I came across a content creator who stated that the antidote to the overconsumption of media content or any sort of information is creation, and it struck a chord with me.
My name is Fatine, I am a 23-year-old student, and that is all you need to know for now.
My consumption tendencies are not unique to me. The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.
During these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.
&quot;Dump it&quot; is a self-discovery journey where I try to turn months of introspection and café conversations into concise paragraphs, backed by research.</span>

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.</span>

Title: Native American Anarchism
Subtitle: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism
Date: 1932
Notes: What is meant by ‘Native American’ in the title is ‘local to America’, not ‘indigenous American’. The text undoubtedly still contains many OCR errors that are hard to find without reading the entire book. Finally, some text appears missing through errors in how the book was originally published, such as a paragraph ends naturally with a period at the end of page 112, but then begins half-way through a sentence at the beginning of page 113 (“exchange and recognized that money”).

Notes: This zine is a transcription of The No State Solution: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon, a live and recorded event which took place on January 22, 2024 in unceded Lekwungen territory in so-called occupied “Victoria, BC, Canada.” While a few grammatical errors have been fixed, we did our best to stay true to the original transcript of our speakers. It is not to be confused with Shuli Branson’s No State Soluton (2023).

 For Soren, 
who taught me the value of a leap. 
 “What we are dealing with here is another version of the Lacanian ‘il n’y a pas de rapport’: if, for Lacan, there is no sexual relationship, then, for Marxism proper, there is no relationship between economy and politics, no meta-language enabling us to grasp the two levels from the same neutral standpoint, although—or, rather, because—these two levels are inextricably intertwined.”

 Democracy has been the American religion since before the Revolution —from New England town halls to the multicultural democracy of Atlantic pirate ships. But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic?

Date: 1971
Notes: In this historical essay the redeemer of the Dutch proletariat is reviewed against the background of his own day and age. Author Rudolf de Jong (born 1932) studied political and social-science, and since 1960 works at the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam. He has published books on the Spanish Civil War and articles on anarchism, Latin America, and Spain. A summary of his essay on Provos and anarchists appeared in the Autumn 1967 issue of Delta. The present article is translated by Elizabeth Wentholt-Haig.

Financed by agribusiness, these advertisements portray a virtuous cycle, showcasing images of contented rural workers amidst soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar cane plantations, as well as happy urban families. They are all content because they can feed, clothe themselves, and fuel their cars, thanks to the agro-industry.

                              <span>last weekend i went to see a movie with some friends from high school and one of them pulled me aside to be like: &quot;do you remember one of the first times we spoke? it was in the wing where they always made us line up for assembly and you were asking me if the art for this series got better over time.&quot; 

i didn&#x27;t. this must have been close to eight years ago. 

another friend, who first introduced me to haikyuu!!, quickly chimed in with a &quot;no, she asked me the exact same thing in history club. right before we watched magic mike xxl.&quot; that last bit could have been a joke, though it probably isn&#x27;t. regardless, i didn&#x27;t really remember it either. sophomore year was surprisingly busy for me, so i imagine i must have spent the rest of that period catching up on sleep.

                              <span>I have been listening to JRE for a long time. There are some common themes. Chimpanzee obsession, humans as biological boot-loaders for AI, and looking at people as babies.
The last one is a powerful idea. Basically in your day-to-day interaction when someone is being really difficult and mean, the first instinct is to be mean back to them. To put out the fire with fire. It never works out. A great idea is to pause and visualise them as babies. I personally visualise them as little kids throwing a fit.
How do you deal with such kids? You are gentle and firm as the situation requires. Maybe discipline them in the right way if needed. Look at their viewpoint and try to align incentives. Maybe you are in the wrong?
The point is, if a little kid is mean to you, you don&#x27;t take it personally. People (generally) are not mean to little kids back out of spite. You don&#x27;t hold grudges against them.
It is an awesome framework that does wonders for your peace of mind. Do give it a shot.</span>

                              <span>Ah... how difficult it is to admit this, but I failed. Actually, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s difficult, if I&#x27;m afraid, or if I just lack courage, despite many people saying that fear is the absence of courage, so this might be redundant.
I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor... I remember setting up LANs for acquaintances or friends to play games, and even setting up a server (more li…</span>

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>

hacks? Don&#x27;t tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.
First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>
