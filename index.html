                              <span>After the jury came in with its verdict that Donald Trump was guilty of a scheme and coverup to illegally influence the 2016 election, the Biden campaign issued a statement saying that the judgment demonstrated that “no one is above the law,” not even a former President. The overwhelming truth is that the majority of  More

When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Before I finished watching DuckTales, I was going through their TV Tropes pages and found they had their own dedicated Broken Base page, which I thought was funny.
According to the main page, a Broken Base is defined as the following:
A Broken Base is a civil war among fans of a particular franchise. Almost every franchise has at least some internal conflict among its fanbase, but a truly broken base is characterized by a sustained and exceptionally vicious conflict between two or more large, vocal, and entrenched factions with little or no middle ground to be found between them.

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

As we enter the eighth month of Israel’s genocidal campaign against Palestinians, the flow of weapons to Israel continues from the United States, Germany, Canada, Italy, Australia, and other Western countries. Even as some governments claim to have halted transfers or to not be sending weapons at all, they continue to provide licences or parts and components that are instrumental to the continuing onslaught. As people are now being pulled from the rubble in Rafah, in a strip of land already known as the world’s “largest open-air prison,” in a country and people bordered and confined by a violent settler colonial state, the relationships between the profiteers of the military-industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the border industrial complex come starkly into focus. And in the demands of the student encampments, the connections of these structures of state violence to universities becomes clear as well.

                              <span>Netanyahu addresses the Knesset.
Forgotten in the mainstream media’s coverage of the Israeli assault on Gaza—if it was ever known by the correspondents—is the long history of Netanyahu and Likud in the creation and support of Hamas. Despite the flood of reports and commentaries in the mainstream media no mention is ever made of Israeli’s complicity in creating and sustaining Hamas in order to split the Palestinians politically and to sever Gaza from the West Bank. That was done in order to prevent forever the establishment of a Palestinian state. For Likud and Netanyahu the greatest threat is peace. Peace would end the dream of Likud and its rightwing allies of an Israeli state that includes the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.

On Tuesday, Stacy Gilbert, a 20-year veteran of the State Department, resigned in protest, after charging that Biden’s State Department falsified a report on whether Israel was restricting the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza. Gilbert had been one of the Department’s experts helping to assemble the NSM-20 report to Congress assessing Israel’s compliance with US law in its military operations in Gaza. But she charges the report was removed from the experts before it was completed and its conclusions adulterated by the leadership of the department.

                              <span>I love my blog! I really do! I want to write every day. But I don&#x27;t. Why? Because of the Perfection Bug!
&quot;You need to share a unique thought&quot;
&quot;Your idea should be worth penning&quot;
&quot;You need to write in great detail&quot;
Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.
But today, I decided to squash that bug!
I don&#x27;t need unique thoughts. I don&#x27;t need amazing ideas. I don&#x27;t need to explain things in detail.
All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all I need to write on my blog.
So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to messing with the blog&#x27;s CSS! I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.
I&#x27;ve also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...
While I&#x27;m deciding, please enjoy the croissant button. It&#x27;s given me more serotonin than it should.</span>

                              <span>If anyone is perplexed or surprised why Americans are so upset about the economy, they should look no further than the Income Distribution and Dynamics in America (IDDA) recent report by the Federal Reserve Board of Minneapolis and its data site that looks at the stagnation of American income and economic mobility in America. It unfortunately confirms what we already know—the neoliberal state benefits unevenly and in ways that confound an ability to challenge it..

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has been operating as a lender of last resort through its “discount window” (DW) for more than a century. Historically, however, the DW has been plagued by stigma—banks’ reluctance to use the DW, even for benign reasons, out of concerns that it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness. In this post, we report on new research showing that once a DW facility is stigmatized, removing that stigma is difficult.</span>

Since the early 1980s, Boris has been repeatedly prosecuted for articulating left-wing ideals. More

But much Democratic opposition exists in the form of incentives for green energy industries, for example, those built into the Inflation Reduction Act. In terms of actually holding climate polluters accountable, other than Biden’s budgetary proposal to end tax breaks (which is, after all, only a proposal), and a pause on natural gas permits, Democratic challenges have come in the form of “homework assignments for companies, and requests for Justice Department investigations,” wrote Axios reporter Ben German.

                              <span>I don’t believe in peace anymore. I used to think of myself as a pacifist. Now I’m not so sure. Today I understand what the slogan “No Justice, No Peace” means. But I want more than justice. I would be ok with nearly anything if it stopped the genocide in its tracks. “Does that mean  More

                              <span>Today I got coffee with a college friend who I last saw in July of 2023. In the months since then, she has not only quit her job, but also somehow gotten engaged AND married (in a courthouse wedding) without telling any of us. What is going on? Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven&#x27;t even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.
This is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I&#x27;ll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through &#x27;husband&#x27; will catch in my mouth and &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; will slip out instead.

MK: Hello and welcome to THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES, a podcast for and about queer and neurodivergent kids and teens living out anarchy and youth liberation. 
 Here at THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES we believe that youth autonomy is not only crucial to queer and trans liberation, but to anarchy itself. Governance is inherently based on projecting linear narratives of time and Development and gender onto our necessarily asynchronous and atemporal queer lives, and kids, teens, and everyone else affected by anti-child ageism are at the center of this form of oppression. 
 Our goal with the podcast is to create a s…</span>

 The first impression produced upon a stranger by a village in Great Russia is undoubtedly gloomy. The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. 
 The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes. Sometimes, when f…</span>

 Much has been written lately in condemnation of the free libraries, on the ground that they were chiefly used by those who cared only for light reading, and that the more serious books were rarely in demand. It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…</span>

 THE Russian educated woman is known to some extent in this country for the part which she took in the struggles for political freedom. Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. 
 If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…</span>

 THE necessity of growing more foodstuffs in this country has perhaps never been so evident as it is now. That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming? Could not, let us say, several County Councils, especially in those counties where there are patches of a lighter soil, establish a number of sm…</span>

 The train had just arrived at the station of N—–, an out-of-the-way place on one of the branches of the South-Eastern system. The few travellers alighted—three men and a woman—and stood on the platform, waiting till the way was deal- to cross to the other side and make their way out. 
 The men belonged in the vicinity and knew each other. They talked together, while the woman—a young brunette, thin and poorly dressed in black—stood apart, leaning on the railing. Her eyes roved over the surrounding country and seemed to s…</span>

I wake up, do what I have to do to keep my scholarship and my body in decent condition, and go to sleep. Repeat. My days have a rhythm I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy, because college life is the same stressful day over and over again, with a little respite here and there. And it&#x27;s like, God, I&#x27;m 20 years old. I should be at the club.
But life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don&#x27;t know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend. Being able to take it slow in the morning, enough to think about things like this, is rare.
I&#x27;m alive. That&#x27;s something.</span>

                              <span>One of the iron laws of people being creative on the internet is that it’s only a matter of time until the haters arrive.
Yesterday on Twitter, I saw post after post mocking the increasing popularity of bearblog, the “bear”-bones blogging platform that simply gives people a blank slate and lets them go at it. One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. &quot;Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...&quot;
To the contrary - I&#x27;m loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.
In this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest. Amidst it all, bearblog stands tall as a quiet, &quot;old-internet&quot; venue -- a corner of the web well worth preserving.</span>

                              <span>I recently read Kristin&#x27;s post where she notes that a lot of blogs have a very serious tone to them, and laughed because it was something I clocked too, at least in my own posting behavior recently!
I think I naturally like to reflect, but I&#x27;d noticed that whenever I came on here, I found myself endeavoring to write Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter1, because a lot of the posts I read were (either intentionally or naturally) Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I&#x27;m happy for the reminder to unclench. Honestly, I personally prefer reading the day-to-day, thesis-less stuff myself.2
Last Sunday I went on an overnight staycation with my friends at a small villa on the outskirts of the city! It started out a little …</span>

                              <span>I recently came across a tweet that rubbed me the wrong way.
It stated: &quot;Mediocre people often have a clear tell: you&#x27;ll often see them hanging out with other mediocre people, probably because the A+ folks avoid them.&quot;
This reeks of the kind of elitist, self-congratulatory attitude that plagues certain circles. Who determines what makes someone &quot;mediocre&quot; or an &quot;A+&quot;? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.
Excellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don&#x27;t just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of &quot;A+ folks.&quot; The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.
Perhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...
 and I&#x27;ve all fallen for the bait.</span>

                              <span>Global central banks and finance ministries held nearly $12 trillion of foreign exchange reserves as of the end of 2023, with nearly $7 trillion composed of U.S. dollar assets. Nevertheless, a narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system. Some market participants have similarly linked the apparent increase in official demand for gold in recent years to a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.</span>

The media, the schools, the judges, the cops, politicians, surveillance, technology, work. All have their role to play in repression. [1]
 Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance. All these words are difficult to discuss because they combine personal experiences with repressive practices deliberatel…</span>

Killing King Abacus
 To Kill King Abacus is to create relations without measure. If we aim to destroy capitalism we cannot reproduce its necrophilic logic which reduces relationships to numbers. To Kill King Abacus is to destroy the social net which privileges mediated transactions and images over direct relations. Because money is a general equivalent and thus is nearly limitless in its applications, it conquers other signifiers of value; capitalism transforms other value systems into itself.

Title: Errico Malatesta: A Brief Biography
Date: 2020
Notes: A brief biographical statement used to preface a reader for the DSA LSC Political Education Working Group&#x27;s Malatesta Reader, which was used in a series of study circles in 2020 to explore Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Towards Anarchy,&quot; and &quot; An Anarchist Programme&quot;.

 Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Italy on 14 December 1853. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II .
