                              <span>At a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump invoked a chilling convergence of law, order, and violence—a cornerstone of what can only be described as his politics of disposability. By referencing The Purge, a dystopian film where the government legalizes all forms of violence, including murder, for 12 hours, Trump escalates his rhetoric to a dangerous metaphor. In his hands, “the purge” becomes more than just a narrative device; it embodies a vision in which state-sanctioned violence reaches its grotesque climax. More

Several winners have actually asked that the payout be donated back to other organizations fighting patent trolls. This isn&#x27;t intended to be anyone&#x27;s full time job. It is intended to reward technical people with industry knowledge who may be able to help surface prior art and are as sick of patent trolls as we are.</span>

Just so happens that the &quot;love centre&quot; is also the &quot;vomiting centre&quot; along with a load of other stuff. I&#x27;d treat this hand-wavy claim with the same kind of skepticism - your counter-example is an excellent one. I agree that looking at a phone first thing in the morning is a bad idea, but for very different reasons.</span>

On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”
This is interesting to me. It does make some evolutionary sense but at the same time, i wake up every morning and look at my girlfriends face, hopefully that does not subconsciously trigger the same response.
That said,  the &quot;sky before screens&quot; idea has been rummaging in my mind since i first heard about it https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/sky-before-screens-has-ma...</span>

This official explanation by the Israeli military was meant to justify the killing of 492 people and the wounding of 1,645 in a single day of Israeli strikes.
This ready-to-serve explanation shall accompany us throughout the Israeli war in Lebanon, however long it takes. Israeli media is now heavily citing these claims and, by extension, US and western media are following suit. More

                              <span>Hi Matt, great that you&#x27;re participating here and I&#x27;m broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine&#x27;s conduct.
However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites.
To be entirely blunt it&#x27;s all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it&#x27;s because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance.
If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE&#x27;s conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It&#x27;s not going to go away on its own.</span>

                              <span>Connectome-adjacent neuroscientist here. Definitely not a dead end! But also definitely not the whole picture.
One of the main open questions in neuroscience right now is how network structure, dynamics, and function are related in the brain. Connectomes provide tremendous insight into structure, but as mentioned this does not generically solve either the dynamics or function problem. For example, for many of these neurons we don&#x27;t have a good understanding of their input-output relationship, and the nature of this relationship can strongly affect the dynamics that emerge in a highly connected network. Individual variability across connectomes, and how connectomes change over development are also a significant issue, but at least for the fly it&#x27;s thought that many of the basic structures are pretty conserved across adult animals, even if many of the details could differ.
Modulo these caveats, knowing the physical network structure of the brain does still impose huge constraints on what kinds of models we should be using for gaining insight into dynamics and function. For example, there are well known areas (the &quot;mushroom bodies&quot;) with specific feed-forward connectivity patterns that are very different from a random recurrent network. Further, there are at least some areas in the fly brain where we think there are indeed quite clean structure-function relationships, e.g. in the central complex of the fly brain, which contains a physical ring of neurons and is thought to support a &quot;bump&quot; of activity that acts as a sort of compass that helps flies navigate via a ring-attractor-like dynamical system. Thus, even though it has many missing pieces, a wiring diagram like this can be tremendously useful for generating hypotheses to guide more targeted experiments and theoretical studies.</span>

                              <span>Always cool to see new mutex implementations and shootouts between them, but I don’t like how this one is benchmarked. Looks like a microbenchmark.
Most of us who ship fast locks use very large multithreaded programs as our primary way of testing performance. The things that make a mutex fast or slow seem to be different for complex workloads with varied critical section length, varied numbers of threads contending, and varying levels of contention.
(Source: I wrote the fast locks that WebKit uses, I’m the person who invented the ParkingLot abstraction for lock impls (now also used in Rust and Unreal Engine), and I previously did research on fast locks for Java and have a paper about that.)</span>

It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

                              <span>Disclaimer: I wrote this article before OpenAI released o1, which now hides its &quot;reasoning&quot; tokens making them inaccessible through the tiktoken library. I think o1 uses the same base tokenizer as GPT-o, but unfortunately we can no longer observe this directly.
GPT-o introduces a new tokenizer o200k_base, which both doubles the model&#x27;s vocabulary size to 200k (previously 100k with GPT-4) and significantly improves token compression, especially for non-English tokens.

Source: GPT-o release
Compression
For non-Latin scripts, o200k_base achieves significantly higher token compression compared to GPT-4&#x27;s c100k_base, demonstrating more efficient word tokenization.
For example, looking at the Tamil sentence நீ எப்படி இருக்கிறாய்? நான் நல்லா இருக்கேன். (translation: How are you? I am fine.), c10…</span>

In the process we have a contagion of functional illiteracy, cultural apocalypse and no real vibrancy. The Muhammadan spirit is missing from Dawah Inc.

Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

I was feeling rather cooped up earlier so I went out for a walk. Smack in the pouring rain. Thankfully, my sneakers were worn and in need of replacing so getting them soaked wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal; still, one is forced to ask oneself if they&#x27;re capable of making good life decisions when the wind starts howling against your umbrella. By the time I got to the halfway point of my walk, lightning was flashing furiously. Like I said, not a good life decision.
Almost every store was closed today. The only things left running were big corporate: convenience stores and chain cafes. I stopped by a Louisa (Taiwan&#x27;s Starbucks equivalent) and saw that there was only the barista inside.

This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.

COBOL&#x27;s promise was that it was human-like text, so we wouldn&#x27;t need programmers anymore.  A lot like &quot;low code&quot; platforms, and now LLM generated code.
The problem is that the average person doesn&#x27;t know how to explain &amp; solve a problem in sufficient detail to get a working solution.  When you get down to breaking down that problem... you become a programmer.
The main lesson of COBOL is that it isn&#x27;t the computer interface/language that necessitates a programmer.</span>

                              <span>Custom fit lightweight wheelchairs are expensive. My Ti-Lite (one of the most popular lightweight chair brands) Aero Z starts at $3k and goes up quickly with wheels and backrest and casters and various other options that I need for sitting 16 hours a day without creating more problems. Insurance covers this for me every 5 years, but of course that&#x27;s not a luxury every one has. Most plans don&#x27;t cover DME 100%.
What Zack and Cambry are doing is great.
(edit) I’d like to add that I think part of being able to drive costs down is that they’re not offering these via insurance so they sidestep the need for FDA approval to market it as a medical device (hence the company name), CMS approval and HCPCS coding and all the regulatory costs that come with that.
Now don&#x27;t get me started on power wheelchair cost...</span>

But I have spent the past year struggling to get back into Mozilla store after a manual review. As far as I can tell, there are maybe two reviewers that are based in Europe (Romania?). The turn around time is long when I am in the US, and it has been rife with this same kind of &quot;simple mistake&quot; that takes 2 weeks to resolve. 
&quot;You need a privacy policy&quot;–we already have one. &quot;You are using machine generated and minified code&quot;–no you are looking at the built code, not the included source. &quot;We cannot reproduce your source&quot;-that&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow instructions and are in the wrong directory.

                              <span>I think it’s reasonable to expect that one of Firefox’s most popular extension publishers gets a higher tier of review service. Gorhill (and other top extension devs) are providing real value to Firefox, and have demonstrated good behavior for years.
This doesn’t mean they should get to publish whatever they want, but if a reviewer is about to reject a high profile plugin, they should get a second set of eyes on it. Which would have obviously caught the mistake here.
Feels like another “Firefox is underinvested in developer relations” story, which is surprising given how much they rely on them.
Edit: honestly the idea that gorhill doesn’t have a dedicated rep at Mozilla is baffling to me. According to their stats the extension has 8.4 million users. They should call him on the phone to let him know there’s a problem with his extension.</span>

I think I can live with the legalization of sports betting if there are strong restrictions against marketing and advertising.

China has nearly one-fifth of the world&#x27;s population and on some measures is the largest economy in the world, although per person national income is only 30% of that of the US.

                              <span>Recent events have heightened awareness of systemic risk stemming from nonbank financial sectors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.</span>

Cohost was the first place where it felt like, consistently, someone was always reading. Something about the site&#x27;s design and user culture created a magical space where people approached things with openness and curiosity and willingness to give their time and attention.
This felt like a place where you could write about anything and people would care. I&#x27;ve talked about the Put your Helmet…</span>

it really is precious, sometimes. to look at something and be able to experience it with your senses. it&#x27;s novel, most days. you just do it without thinking.
but then there&#x27;s times when you experience an intangible unreality so strong that it becomes a force in your life that can&#x27;t be measured. we don&#x27;t have scales for that, or weights that add up the unreal intangible space that exists between little lights in a grid &amp; your brain.
there is a space, somewhere within the imagination, that fills in bit by bit over time. like reading a book, making the world come to life, hearing voices, making up the parts that the author never tells you. internet spa…</span>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus.

Do you want to present your blogging timeline in a stylish way? Or perhaps have a unique style for your micro thoughts? Or keep a changelog for documenting your blog’s development?
Say hello to the latest cub in the Bearming theme family: Timeline.
Here’s an example with the time-focused timeless song In the Year 2525 (further down the page, you’ll find instructions on how to implement it on your blog):
Year 3535
In the year 3535, ain&#x27;t gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie, everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.
Year 5555
In the year 5555, your arms hangin&#x27; limp at your sides, your legs got nothin&#x27; to do, some machine&#x27;s doin&#x27; that for you.

As an aside, I&#x27;m starting to get annoyed with the &quot;we moved fast and broke things, we&#x27;re smol indie hackers&quot; defense that has been popping up more lately in various contexts. The whole incident started because they got venture capital for their fork and were in a startup accelerator for several months: that&#x27;s not moving fast or being indie.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I would add a generic “culture fit” component to each candidate score which you could use as a hedge to admit legacies without calling them as such.
This is not new. This is a battle as old as time.
Want to keep out poor people? Require them to live on campus instead of locally at home. Want to keep out the wrong kind of person? Start requiring college essays to get a &quot;culture fit&quot;. Or add &quot;geographic diversity&quot; to get less NYC Jews, or require &quot;well rounded&quot; candidates that do more than pass tests to keep out Asian Americans. Or conduct interviews so you can see their race in-person without asking for it on a form.

&quot;In 2019...[Assemblyman Phil] Ting tried to push through a bill banning legacy preferences in California. That effort fell short. But he did succeed with a measure requiring private colleges to report to the Legislature how many students they admit because of ties to alumni or donors.&quot;
This time, &quot;an earlier version [of the bill] had proposed that schools face civil penalties for violating the law, but that provision was removed in the State Senate.&quot;
This is a battle against powerful people. Wins will be incremental. About the smartest things those opposing this could have done would have been firing up (a) nihilistic elements about how nothing changes and (b) outrage at anything short of an absolute ban with criminal penalties and forced revocation of degrees to legacy graduates or whatever.</span>

Will be interesting to see how important that is to the selective universities in the state. I don’t see how being named and shamed on an official government website is much different than the status quo of being named and shamed in a media report on legacy admissions.</span>

                              <span>I love everything about this.
There is this undercurrent to our technology landscape. A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost.  I can only describe it as a live exploration of concepts _through_ technology, where functional fixedness is a foreign concept, including in the shared experience of social construct; everything becomes parts to be remixed in a way.  In this place people just do things that, by way of having fun, just becomes art.  It&#x27;s emergent gameplay just by following a solitary &quot;rule of cool.&quot;
I saw this page and was immediately transported back to the late 1990&#x27;s and early &#x27;aughts.  The kind of &quot;I glued these things together and just look&quot; attitude that graced the pages of hackaday.com and slashdot.org.  LED &quot;throwies&quot; come to mind.
In this case we have a de-facto art installation.  I imagine that this was probably put together with odds and ends, maybe installed illegally, and probably doesn&#x27;t have longevity in mind for its construction. It lightheartedly challenges some conventions, challenges ideas about privacy, brushes up against copyright, and is entertaining to boot. Most importantly, how it was made is less interesting than what it _does_, and where it carries the conversation of the observer.  Or maybe: that&#x27;s the point.</span>

                              <span>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m a YC alum whose last start-up was acquired by Google, who applied to this batch and didn&#x27;t get an interview.
YC is not the stamp of quality it once was, to be sure, though it still works as social proof, because investors (especially VCs) want to invest in companies other investors like (or failing that, companies they imagine other investors would like).  YC would say that they aren&#x27;t trying to be a stamp of quality or social proof, they are just trying to help start-ups.
If I had to take a stab at articulating how YC has changed, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s become a VC, picking ideas to generate returns.
This rejection email from 2022 that someone posted online cements the idea for me (excerpted):

                              <span>In recognition of Deaf Awareness Month and the importance of inclusivity in the tech community, we are spotlighting Catherine Paganini, facilitator and one of the founding members of CNCF Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Working Group (DHHWG). In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar, a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team, sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes.
Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion. Through his involvement in the DHHWG, he connected with members of the Kubernetes community who encouraged him to join SIG ContribEx - the group responsible for sustaining the Kubernetes contributor experience.

a classic. delicious Y2K Teal. iconic. gotta love her. 4.5/5.
blueberry

barely distinguishable from the original Bondi Blue, but from what i can tell in photos online and in real life, it&#x27;s a slightly lighter color compared to bondi blue. but because of that, i think it&#x27;s missing some contrast. i don&#x27;t like it as much. 3/5
grape

underappreciated one! this color combination makes me think of the Teenz Zone at my library circa 2000. 4/5
tangerine

truthfully, my fondness for this one is 99% because of The Cheat&#x27;s computer. but it&#x27;s a fun, retrofuturistic color choice, especially with the form factor. on its own i give it a 4.5/5, but it gets elevated to 5/5 because it makes me think of Homestar.

                              <span>In a world of endless notifications, feature-bloated apps, and constant digital noise, I found myself yearning for simplicity. That&#x27;s why I created Nihil - a suite of minimalist tools designed to help you focus on what truly matters.
The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That&#x27;s the core of Nihil&#x27;s philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

What Makes Nihil Different?
Purposeful Design
Every feature in Nihil is there because …</span>

                              <span>My first time watching Everything, Everywhere, All At Once (EEAAO) was at a friend&#x27;s house with about ten other Asian immigrants. There&#x27;s a scene where the male lead, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), was putting googly eyes all over the lanterns and doing a sneaky shush at the camera before running away.
&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s [deadname],&quot; said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.
Eh? That&#x27;s me?
I&#x27;ll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my &quot;I have to be a man&quot; phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It&#x27;s very easy to read it that way because Waymond&#x27;s character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead. He is presented as effeminate, weak, and his voice is high-pitched and lacks a full range. As a knee-jerk gut reaction, we foc…</span>

This is a project I&#x27;ve started many times before without a lot of success on several different WordPress sites—all of which no longer exist. The first was a free blog I set up when I first came to Japan in 2015 as a student. I&#x27;d seen so many blogs by other exchange students and thought it&#x27;d be pretty exciting. The only problem was that I didn&#x27;t think that anything I was doing was very exciting, so I quickly stopped doing it. I&#x27;ve tried since to make several paid sites that focus on my reading and writing book reviews. There were a lot of problems with that, most of which came down to the fact that I was extremely worried about making the &quot;perfect&quot; site even though it was just something that I wanted to do for fun. WordPress has always just also been r…</span>
