                              <span>You know how, for the past however many years, Bandcamp has had a little Discovery chart at the bottom that tracks best-selling albums in various categories?
Well, now it looks a bit like this:
There&#x27;s something very weird to me about hiding the discoverability of albums behind a series of links without any...you know, albums on display.
The biggest thing to me, however, is the categories chosen &amp; what seems very noticeably omitted... Soundtracks are nowhere to be found. Game music is a huge part of Bandcamp&#x27;s presence, and game soundtracks have always felt like an embarrassing little side-effect of Bandcamp&#x27;s popularity. Nearly every editorial focuses on indie hits, the big hitters that&#x27;ve come to the platform, etc. etc... Yet somehow, Epic bought Bandcamp at one point in time before it w…</span>

                              <span>A lot of you probably know that I have ADHD. I talk about it fairly often.
I didn&#x27;t get diagnosed until somewhat recently, because, as is the story for a lot of women with ADHD, my symptoms as a little girl were different than the ones that were typically recognized, AKA the ones that young boys tend to exhibit more often. I was incredibly messy: my desks, lockers, backpacks, and bedroom tended to be absolute chaos. I lost things like homework and winter gloves a lot. I was constantly spacing out and daydreaming. I was generally kind of weird and bad at conversations.
But I wasn&#x27;t disruptive or hyperactive, and I got good grades despite my problems with remembering to do homework, so my symptoms weren&#x27;t seen as symptoms. They were flaws. I didn&#x27;t need help, I just needed to try to be bette…</span>

                              <span>On Saturday V came over after my game to bake brownies with me. People (especially my boss from work) always ask me how he&#x27;s doing, which is a hard question for me to answer because I don&#x27;t see him often. Even when I do, we don&#x27;t talk much. He doesn&#x27;t share much about what&#x27;s on his mind and we share few overlapping interests.
Perhaps because our conversations don&#x27;t scratch the same itch of depth that my chats with other friends do, I don&#x27;t feel as gnawing a desire to see him regularly. So I appreciate it extra when he reaches out and asks to catch up, since I don&#x27;t do nearly as good a job of keeping in touch with him as I do with my other friends.
Anyway, the brownies we made with my almond flour were okay. They tasted fine but turned out on the dry side because the recipe called for a sma…</span>

I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. The point of a strike is to demonstrate the value of your labor by withholding it. Withholding your labor in a slow week would be counterproductive. Strikes (just like any effective form of protest) are supposed to be inconvenient, so in saying what you said, you&#x27;re really just expressing you don&#x27;t like strikes. Having this blow up in election week is a risk the Times knowingly took in not meeting their workers&#x27; needs sufficiently, and drawing out the negotiations as long as they have. The guild is doing the right thing.</span>

If you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.
I have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.
Yes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it&#x27;s usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).
Yes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).
Yes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it&#x27;s something you need with a remote env anyways.
---
The only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I&#x27;m my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn&#x27;t your source code in 99.5% of cases, it&#x27;s the team that executes that source code in production.
If you&#x27;re in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I&#x27;ve worked in those too...)</span>

                              <span>&gt;&gt; [Why not build programmer performance measurement tooling?] It&#x27;s the job of a manager to know what their reports are up to, and whether they&#x27;re doing a good job of it, and are generally effective. If they can&#x27;t do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.
Agreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart&#x27;s law. [0]
In the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.
Consequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won&#x27;t use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They&#x27;ll only use those dashboards.
Which then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.
Helping a colleague doesn&#x27;t show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn&#x27;t on the sprint board? Fuck that.
Which is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.
And then, because this is the work reality you&#x27;ve created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you&#x27;re left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.

                              <span>In an era marked by unprecedented threats to democracy from rising authoritarian forces, universities—once celebrated citadels of democratic learning and public service—now find themselves caught in a profound political and ideological siege. Rather than championing social justice or fostering spaces for rigorous intellectual exchange, many institutions have shifted their priorities to profit, silencing dissent and embracing market-driven models that serve a predatory capitalism, thus betraying their democratic mission. This crisis has deep roots, but the recent onslaught by far-right politicians and a reactionary billionaire elite is without precedent in its intensity and scale. This trend weakens the humanities and liberal arts, stripping higher education of its capacity to serve as a democratic public sphere and robbing it of the potential to cultivate socially aware students who challenge injustices and hold power to account. Increasingly, higher education runs the risk of becoming either right wing indoctrination centers or dead zones of the imagination. More

                              <span>I recently had a horrific dream that transported me from the safety and peace of Vietnam to the blazing hell on earth that is Gaza. I was holding a sniper rifle and in my sights was an IDF soldier. There’s not a shred of doubt in my mind that I would have pulled the trigger had the dream not ended. While I’m a great supporter of non-violence, I also firmly believe in the right of self-defense, including in Gaza where Israel is the invader and a fanatical agent of genocide. More

                              <span>Maybe it’s a small thing but I still can’t get over a line from Larry Hogan’s 2020 memoir. It’s about the first covid death to occur on Hogan’s watch as Maryland governor, the job he held from 2015 to 2023. “[It was] a Prince George’s County man in his sixties who had underlying medical issues,”  More

                              <span>There&#x27;s a decent amount of cynicism in the comments, which I understand. I think this is a really cool and novel study, though.
Historically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).
The last couple of decades we&#x27;ve seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).
This mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.
The method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.
The whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.</span>

                              <span>At a former company, we were all issued YubiKey Nanos, which just never worked for me. None of my coworkers had a problem, but I couldn’t get the damn thing to register a touch no matter what I did, including swapping keys.
 Eventually I came across a thread on an internal list for employees over forty, with several other people who were all having the same problem. The solution? Lick your finger. Gross, but it did the trick. And I’m stuck licking my finger every time I need to make a YubiKey work.</span>

                              <span>Touchscreens are anti-accessibility.
Lack of tactile feedback for the sight-impaired is the obvious part but there is another thing:
Touchscreens just stop registering your touch when you get old. The older you get the less moisture there&#x27;s in your skin, which at some point makes touch screens ignore you.

there&#x27;s nothing wrong with people who do that. they&#x27;re not shallow. it&#x27;s the digital equivalent to carrying a sketchbook with you, and it&#x27;s certainly more portable and intuitive to use than other digital art mediums.

I have friends still chained to the demon-site formerly known as Twitter1 and I keep hearing them complain about how the internet is so mean and angry, how everyone just posts bait to piss people off and don&#x27;t meaningfully engage with eachother. Unfortunately, this is the way much of the modern internet is, and not due to any malicious intent: Websites that are free need to serve you ads, and the more ads the better. Therefore, these sites want to maximize the time you spend on them, so you can see more ads. …</span>

                              <span>i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since 2008.
they’re mostly self portraits.
his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.
sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.

a couple of things inspire me:
along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.
ex:
18 September 2024 
Onsdag

The logs arrive, I can now start building my house. 

the other thing that encourages me creatively is that he’s been doing this project since 2008. that’s a long time. It astounds me that more people aren’t liking his drawings.
the number of likes on his work doesn’t seem to faze him.
he just continues drawing, sharing his work, and not making things more complicated than they need to be.
he loves to draw, so he does it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve deleted my youtube watch history and paused it.


friend was a bit annoyed that he couldn&#x27;t see my youtube recommendations anymore, but I take this as an absolute win.
Now all I have to waste time with is my subscription tab, which is much less frequent in content I actually want to consume.
As always on bearblog, being more mindful on what you consume is a good thing.</span>

                              <span>This post shows how to use the Webmention.io API to display all the interactions people have had with your blog posts.
You’ll need two things to make this work:
Your website must be set up to use the Webmention.io service.
You’ll need a bit of custom JavaScript to show the interactions below each blog post.
Setting up Webmention.io itself is outside the scope of this post, as this website already provides detailed instructions.
Now, let’s move on to the custom JavaScript you’ll need.
The JavaScript Code
Below is the complete JavaScript code. I’ll explain how each part works after the code.

my laptop shipped with Windows 11, and i was getting increasingly frustrated with it. it felt sluggish and unnecessarily unresponsive, despite the fact that my laptop&#x27;s specs were &quot;Decidedly Fine&quot;. between that, and needing something in my life to obsess over and fixate on, i decided to take the leap and try out Linux.
and, well. about half a year later, i ended up killing my Windows 11 partition altogether, and running Linux Mint full time. there&#x27;s been pros and cons. i&#x27;ll get to that.

Depending on who you ask, that might be a lot of time, or just a tiny fraction of their entire life, but one thing is true, a lot can change in that time.
4 Years ago, there was a tiny being, an unknown fella by most people, who was starting to have questions. That tiny being felt like they didn&#x27;t fit anywhere, What was their purpose? Why were they suddenly feeling like this? Are they just overthinking things? They just couldn&#x27;t tell at all.
4 Years ago, these questions were driving them insane, everytime they tried to ignore what was causing them these questions, it would intensify even more, it doesn&#x27;t help things that they barely had friends around that time, friends that could help them with these doubts...
4 Years ago, they gave up questioning this and decided to go inves…</span>

bear.css.observer takes any subdomain from subdomain.bearblog.dev and splits the screen into two panels. On the left is a live preview of the blog content. On the right is an editor where you can tweak the CSS in real-time. As you type, the changes are instantly applied to the preview panel on the left.
To make things more user-friendly, I included some themes that users can select from a dropdown menu. This allows for quick testing of different looks and formatting options without writing CSS from scratch. Submit your theme here.
Once you&#x27;re happy with the styling, you will have a couple options. You can click a button to save the style sheet to localStorage for future sessions. Or you can copy the CSS directly from the editor to your clipboard, making it easy to paste into your bear blog&#x27;s theme customization area. You can export it as a .css file as well.
Admittedly, it&#x27;s a silly project, but I thought some people might find it handy to preview styles throughout their site (including inner pages) without mucking about with Overrides.
Note: bear.css.observer is set to , and the Playground data is stored in your browser.</span>

                              <span>People always say this guy just has had bad luck with his employers but I live in Melbourne and work in data and reckon the whole industry is a scam.
Like why didn&#x27;t anyone catch the issue with the logs? Because it doesn&#x27;t matter, every data team is a cost-centre that unscrupulous managers use to launch their careers by saying they&#x27;re big on AI. So nothing works, no-one cares it doesn&#x27;t work, most the data engineers are incapable of coding fizzbuzz but it doesn&#x27;t matter.
People always wonder why banks etc. use old mainframes. There&#x27;s like a 0% success rate for new data projects. And that 0% includes projects which had launch parties etc. but no-one ever used the data or noticed how broken it was. I don&#x27;t think a lot of orgs which use data as core-infra could modernize, the industry is just so broken at this point I don&#x27;t think we can do what we did 30 years ago.</span>

                              <span>I like the programmers on here telling the professional users that Excel is overblown and they could just use Numbers, OpenOffice or Google sheets.
Imagine an accountant coming on here and telling you that you don&#x27;t need vi, emacs, sublime text or VSCode. You certainly don&#x27;t need your IDEs. After all it&#x27;s perfectly possible to code in Notepad.
You also don&#x27;t need your languages. BASIC was perfectly good.
The killer feature of Excel for financial modelling,  over &#x27;proper&#x27; software,  databases etc is portability and auditability.
Everything I do at work is subject to external audit. Every audit firm in the world has Excel. The tax advisors have Excel too, as to the tax authorities. Apprentices are trained in Excel. The people I hire may not have used our ERP, but they have all used Excel. It is the one constant in our world. The actual accounting records are in an ERP, but all of the outputs are in Excel. I have worked at several multinationals and several SMEs. Excel was everywhere.</span>

                              <span>&gt;he asked the team, “for this meeting I’d like us to try and introduce ourselves a little differently. If you’re comfortable, I’d like us to try and be 10% more vulnerable than we normally would in a work setting.” I remember feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement rise in my chest. I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was. Some of my coworkers shared deeper things I’d never heard in a work setting. It was awkward. It was beautiful.
I&#x27;d rather not have my manager forcing me to do group therapy. I owe the company some work hours and they own me money.
If I want to have personal relations with someone from my work, befriend somebody, share personal things, that is my choice. My personal life is not the company business.
Of course I wouldn&#x27;t say all that to the manager, but &#x27;I&#x27;ll put him on the list of people I should be careful about, and fake some confessions.</span>

Joseph Edwards, a Jamaican refrigeration mechanic, spoke of radical labor politics in Rasta idioms. Let’s reason “to Rahtid!”
His selected writings have been published as Workers Self-Management in the Caribbean (2014). When we read his ideas comparatively with Trinidad’s CLR James, Guyana’s Walter Rodney, and Jamaica’s Michael Manley and Trevor Munroe we can begin to see the antagonisms or debates within the Caribbean radic…</span>

This piece, authored by Joseph Edwards—also known as Fundi or the Caribbean Situationist—offers a unique perspective within the anti-authoritarian tradition of the Caribbean left.
Assumed to be the first publication of the Trinidadian labor organizing group, The New Beginning Movement (NBM) (1971–1978), this booklet was released as Abeng Pamphlet No. 1. The NBM drew inspiration from the Black Power Revolt and the legacy of C.L.R.

I&#x27;ve been using the app for years and it&#x27;s a really great piece of software, well designed and well built. It&#x27;s always been incredible value for the price, especially given that it basically replaces Photoshop for a wide swath of the market without compromising on UX (which is a problem for other competitors) at a price point that&#x27;s like 1-2 months of an Adobe subscription (I don&#x27;t even know exactly what that costs any more because Pixelmator + parts of the Affinity suite got me out of their clutches).
Adobe must not be stoked about this news. And I&#x27;ll just keep my fingers crossed this all heads in a direction that&#x27;s more Logic than Dark Sky.</span>

                              <span>Is there any way this can go bad?
When Apple acquired DarkSky, they absolutely destroyed a service that I loved and relied on. Four years on, Apple Weather is less reliable than DarkSky, and not even close to feature complete.
But DarkSky was a cross-platform service, whereas Pixelmator is software that&#x27;s already Apple-only. I&#x27;m wondering how much I should be worried, and if I should already be abandoning ship.</span>

                              <span>This might sound stupid but I refuse to go to dentists that have &quot;too nice&quot; of an office.
Over the years I have lived in several places and had a variety of dentists and one common theme that sticks with me, the nicer and higher tech the office is, the more procedures they are going to recommend you. They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow.
I&#x27;ve had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done.
The dentists there took xrays, etc and didn&#x27;t find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong.
When I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums.
This has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill. When i got to college and went to the dentist there, they couldn&#x27;t find a problem.</span>

I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context.
It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter.
Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander&#x27;s family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. Thi…</span>

                              <span>People who blog sometimes share advice, myself included. Advice about life, careers, relationships… anything, really. If it’s something someone has lived through, chances are they’ve got insights to offer. Sure, some might call it unsolicited advice, but you’re free to read it or skip it, so it doesn’t matter much in the end.
Here’s the secret: the advice bloggers give? It’s often as much for themselves as it is for you.
And that’s no surprise. Writing is often called therapeutic, meditative, or an exercise in self-reflection. All of those are true. As we write (as I’m doing right now) thoughts that we hadn’t even realized we had come bubbling up. Sometimes, these thoughts take the form of advice. Advice that’s just as relevant to us as it might be to anyone else.
So, is it a problem that the advice bloggers write is actually for them? I don’t think so. It’s obviously helpful for the bloggers themselves, who apparently needed it in the first place. And for readers, it could be just the advice they’ve been searching for, without knowing it. That’s the beauty of blogging: you can stumble upon a story that really speaks to you. Reaching just one person with a story is already a success.
So go ahead. Write your story, and put it out there for the world to see. There might be someone out there who truly needs to read it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure about you, but for me, the web feels untrustworthy these days. So much of the content is either AI generated or created just to sell something, it&#x27;s really hard to find authenticity online. How do you know what sites to trust? Where do you find quality content?
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for a couple of years now, trying to figure out a solution. I feel like we need to wall off parts of the web. You know, have a gated community to keep the riff-raff out. Of course, that feels a bit icky, and keeps out people who might be looking for a better web. It also creates an echo chamber, and that is another pressing issue with the internet. There is also the logistics of how you could do this. I mean, in a way, Medium does this with a login and blocking of articles and that …</span>

MAGA was in force on a crisp Sunday afternoon outside Madison Square Garden in late October. I joined tens of thousands of faithful seeking entry to the Woodstock of fascism. The lineup featured some of the worst people in America: Elon Musk, Stephen Miller, Rudy Giuliani, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK, Jr., JD Vance, Tucker Carlson, Elise Stefanik, Trump’s progeny, C-list racists and cranks, and the Demagogue-in-Chief himself.  More

                              <span>In the last couple of months, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, in that order, made announcements about using nuclear power for their energy needs. Describing nuclear energy using questionable adjectives like “reliable,” “safe,” “clean,” and “affordable,” all of which are belied by the technology&#x27;s seventy-year history, these tech behemoths were clearly interested in hyping up their environmental credentials and nuclear power, which is being kept alive mostly using public subsidies.

                              <span>Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is getting his share of criticism for stopping the paper’s presidential endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris less than two weeks before the election.  Much of the criticism is well deserved, but Bezos correctly identifies the declining credibility of the mainstream media, including his Post as well as the New York Times.

So I filled out my ballot, though not very joyfully, and drove to the drop-off site in our little mill town, where the ballot box was being &quot;monitored&quot; by four MAGA people, adorned in their red hats, who, undeterred by the drenching rain, recorded my arrival on their cellphones and asked to see my ID, a request I replied to with a customary Italian gesture, as I told them had left my papers in Juarez.

                              <span>In 2022 I started building an application for creating Customs declarations. After evaluating some options and writing code in various programming languages and frameworks such as .NET/F#, Go, Rust, React, I eventually decided to write it in Ruby on Rails. Why? Because I was already familiar with Rails and because of that I could literally go 10x faster than I was with any of the aforementioned options that were quite new to me. I told myself that this was temporary, a proof of concept and that later on, I would rewrite it in a different language that wouldn&#x27;t let me shoot myself in the foot as easily as I tend to do with Ruby. The Rails application however quickly grew in functionality and my colleagues really liked the application. I could quickly build features that would make them more…</span>

                              <span>I love the idea of a clean slate. Long time readers of my blogs will know this because I’ve deleted all my posts in search of a clean slate dozens of times. I always get the itch around the New Year or my birthday to start fresh and to have my blog reflect the most recent version of myself. So, I try and throw everything away so that I can rebuild from scratch.
After a couple of decades of starting a with a “clean slate” online and in my personal life, I’ve come to realize that there is no such thing. A clean slate doesn’t truly exist.
In order to have a clean slate, you would need to erase everything that came before. Sure, I can delete the blogs so the public does not see them, but I still wrote them. I still allowed these ideas and concepts to flow from my brain to my hands and manifest…</span>

                              <span>This is probably Google&#x27;s Altavista moment, by making their results crappier by the year in search of Ad dollars everyone has felt that there is a potential for search to be better and once that becomes available they&#x27;ll be in a continious game of catch-up.
Yes, Google has their own AI divisions, tons of money and SEO is to blame for part of their crappiness. But they&#x27;ve also _explicitly_ focused on ad-dollars over algorithmic purity if one is to believe the reports of their internal politics and if those are true they have probably lost a ton of people who they&#x27;d need right now to turn the ship around quickly.</span>

                              <span>Been thinking about this a lot [1]. Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?
The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple&#x27;s Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.
Combining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.
Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.
I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.

                              <span>Introduction
Recently there&#x27;s a report from Github on the rise of snake language to be the top on Github. Yes, Python overtakes Javascript!

Below is a nice time series graph showing language progression over time:

Inspired by this achievement, I once again write how to speedup Python to almost near C/C++ speed! The tools we are using: Codon and Cython to speedup integrate calculation in Python.
Python code
First lets take a look at the original python code.
def f(x):
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a, b, N):
    s &#x3D; 0
    dx &#x3D; (b - a) / N
    for i in range(N):
        s +&#x3D; f(a + i * dx)
    return s * dx

Fairly simple and straightforward.
Codon code
Now here&#x27;s the Codon version:
def f(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a: float, b: float, N: int) -&gt; float…</span>

                              <span>I work for Google, and I just got done with my work day. I was just writing I guess what you&#x27;d call &quot;AI generated code.&quot;
But the code completion engine is basically just good at finishing the lines I&#x27;m writing. If I&#x27;m writing &quot;function getAc...&quot; it&#x27;s smart enough to complete to &quot;function getActionHandler()&quot;, and maybe suggest the correct arguments and a decent jsdoc comment.
So basically, it&#x27;s a helpful productivity tool but it&#x27;s not doing any engineering at all. It&#x27;s probably about as good, maybe slightly worse, than Copilot. (I haven&#x27;t used it recently though.)</span>

Apple is well on its way to ensure you can only run things they allow via app store, they would probably already be there if it wasn&#x27;t for the pesky EU.
If you send your computer/phone to Apple for repair you may get back different physical hardware.
Those things very much highlight that &quot;your&quot; Apple hardware is not yours and that privacy on Apple hardware does not actually exist, sure they may not share that data with other parties but they definitely do not respect your privacy or act like you own the hardware you purchased.
Apple marketing seems to have reached the level indoctrination where everyone just keeps parroting what Apple says as an absolute truth.</span>

                              <span>I really respect Apple&#x27;s privacy focused engineering. They didn&#x27;t roll out _any_ AI features until they were capable of running them locally, and before doing any cloud-based AI they designed and rolled out Private Cloud Compute.
You can argue about whether it&#x27;s actually bulletproof or not but the fact is, nobody else is even trying, and have lost sight of all privacy-focused features in their rush to ship anything and everything on my device to OpenAI or Gemini.
I am thrilled to shell out thousands and thousands of dollars to purchase a machine that feels like it really belongs to me, from a company that respects my data and has aligned incentives.</span>

How do people deal with this? I simply don&#x27;t understand the value proposition. Does Google now have 25% subtly wrong code? Or do they have 25% trivial code? Or do all their engineers babysit the AI and bugfix the subtly wrong code? Or are all their engineers so junior that an AI is such a substantial help?
Like, isn&#x27;t this announcement a terrible indictment of how inexperienced their engineers are, or how trivial the problems they solve are, or both?</span>

                              <span>&gt; Google’s hash match may well have established probable cause for a warrant to allow police to conduct a visual examination of the Maher file.
Very reasonable. Google can flag accounts as CP, but then a judge still needs to issue a warrant for the police to actually go and look at the file. Good job court. Extra points for reasoning about hash values.</span>

                              <span>What’s amazing is that in the past I’ve felt the need to upgrade within a few years.
New video format or more demanding music software is released that slows the machine down, or battery life craters.
Well, I haven’t had even a tinge of feeling that I need to upgrade after getting my M1 Pro MBP. I can’t remember it ever skipping a beat running a serious Ableton project, or editing in Resolve.
Can stuff be faster? Technically of course. But this is the first machine that even after several years I’ve not caught myself once wishing that it was faster or had more RAM. Not once.
Perhaps it’s my age, or perhaps it’s just the architecture of these new Mac chips are just so damn good.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s not forget that jaywalking was essentially created by the automotive industry and its lobbyists, to make life more convenient for drivers. It started in car-heavy places like California, and eventually became a law virtually everywhere in the US, but was never really enforced in New York City, where most people walk or take public transit, rather than drive. If, like most New Yorkers, you walk several kilometers a day, through dozens of intersections, it&#x27;s ludicrous to suggest that you should only walk at crosswalks, and only when the walk sign is lit. New Yorkers don&#x27;t have a concept of &quot;jaywalking&quot;; it&#x27;s just &quot;walking.&quot;</span>
