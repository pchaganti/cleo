This long-form essay was sent to us for publication by “some communist study group“. It discusses the historical role of Ukraine in the contemporary political economy, the response from radicals in the West towards the Russian invasion, and the material effects on the global political economy emanating from the disruption of a major bread basket, specifically with an eye towards revolt. The questions raised here are important not just for the current moment, but also for any social movement that desires to truly engage with “present state of t…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Data structures play a crucial role in determining the performance and efficiency of algorithms. The Array of Structs (AoS) and Struct of Arrays (SoA) are two popular data structures used to represent complex data. Although they can store similar data, they differ in memory layout, access patterns, and performance.
Here&#x27;s an excellent video on Data Oriented Design by Andrew Kelley the creator of Zig programming language.
Array of Structs (AoS)
An AoS is a data structure composed of an array of structures, where each structure represents a single entity with multiple fields or members. The structures are stored contiguously in memory, one after the other.
typedef struct {
    int id;
    float x;
    float y;
} PointAOS;

PointAOS is a struct containing three fields: id (an int…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s from my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic when they can actually see you hurting. For the millionth time in my life, I wished depression manifested like the flu or some other recognizable disease, just to make it simple for me and for the people around me.
How much easier would it be if mental illness were physical - visible and tangible? A runny nose and a sore throat - people would understand. They would offer me tissues, a warm cup of tea, and a sympathetic get well soon. But a shitty compilation of mental symptoms and an even shittier chemical make up? How do I explain an intangible pain?
What can I say, anyway? Sometimes I feel like I am carrying around a heavy suitcase full of sadness everywhere that I go. The smallest task feels impossible. Everything is dull yet heavy, all at once.  Everything matters too much yet nothing matters. Anything would be easier to explain than what&#x27;s really going on.
I think this topic further resonates with me as someone with high-functioning depression. I recall an attempt to open up about my state with a close friend, who reacted with amusement and disbelief, as if I was exchanging lighthearted banter. But you are so put together, Tala. You are successful, ace tests, and excel at work - it must be a misdiagnosis.
I was overwhelmed with shame that later transformed into rage. I found it impossible to articulate the depth of pain - that yes, I am waking up everyday, leaving bed, fulfilling my obligations. But I am still struggling, still fighting a relentless battle with the energy I have left.
And there are millions of us suffering a silent, invisible battle against our mental illnesses, while we present a facade of normalcy to world. Because sometimes silence is the easier option.</span>

This is a bit crass of course; that page is for things I generally don’t want to do and isn’t meant for explanation, exceptions and nuance. Of course there are services I subscribe to - I currently pay for Proton, Spotify and Apple Fitness.
One reason is, of course, that these services don’t offer lifetime payment. But in their cases, I understand how that’s not feasible - their services are heavily dependent on serving content via cloud and development of new content and improved features. The bandwidth needs to be paid for, artists, devs and fitness trainers need to be paid constantly.
But I try to limit what I subscribe to. Everyone has a maximum amount of subscriptions they’re willing to have at the same time and p…</span>

As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I understand that Charlie Munger&#x27;s observation &quot;“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” is applicable everywhere - including science.
Academic scientists&#x27; careers are driven by publishing, citations and impact.  Arguably some have figured how to game the system to advance their careers.  Science be damned.</span>

                              <span>These sorts of articles raise so many thoughts and emotions in me.  I was trained as a computational biologist with a little lab work and ran gels from time to time.  Personally, I hated gels- they&#x27;re finicky, messy, ugly, and don&#x27;t really tell you very much.  But molecular biology as a field runs on gels- it&#x27;s the priimary source of results for almost everything in molbio.  I have seen more talks and papers that rested entirely a single image of a gel which is really just some dark bands.
At the same time, I was a failed scientist: my gels weren&#x27;t as interesting, or convincing compared to the ones done by the folks who went on to be more successful.  At the time (20+ years ago) it didn&#x27;t occur to me that anybody would intentionally modify images of gels to promote the results they claimed, although I did assume that folks didn&#x27;t do a good job of organizing their data, and occasionally published papers that were wrong simply because they confused two images.
Would I have been more successful if fewer people (and I now believe this is a common occurrence) published fraudulent images of gels?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the more important thing is that everybody just went along with this.  I participated in many journal clubs where folks would just flip to Figure 3, assume the gel was what the authors claimed, and proceed to agree with (or disagree with) the results and conclusions uncritically.  Whereas I would spend a lot of time trying to understand what experiment was actually run, and what th e data showed.</span>

                              <span>I am always glad to see people pursuing creating their own programming language. More people should give it a try, IMHO.
A tricky thing that comes up with Rust comparisons is that often, Rust has a feature that&#x27;s weird or hard to use, but it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s the only solution that makes sense within the constraints Rust has placed upon itself. Clicking some links gets me to https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/src/branch/master/docs/yao/de...
&gt; Yao&#x27;s biggest goals are: Correctness, Convenience, Performance, in that order.
Having clear goals is a great thing when making a language, because they give you guidance on what is appropriate to include and what is not.
Rust has certainly demonstrated having similar goals, but in a slightly different order: Correctness, Performance, and then Convenience. So it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if Yao could do some things better than Rust, in accordance with its goals. But that also means that sometimes, Rust would be useful where Yao cannot be. Everything is tradeoffs.
Incidentally, I actually think that figuring out what your values are, and what your needs are, is a great way to pick a programming language. Decide what matters to you as an engineer, and then find a language that shares similar values. I gave a conference talk a few years back on this idea, and how I viewed Rust&#x27;s values at the time https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-tradeoffs/
This was based off of bcantrill&#x27;s Platform as a Reflection of Values, which was very influential on me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Xhx970_JKX4
If you&#x27;ve ever heard about Oxide&#x27;s focus on values, this is some of the older background on that.</span>

                              <span>We took our kids to Disney World once.
When asked what their favorite part of the trip was, they responded..
The hot tub.
At the hotel.
My kids light up the most when I am fully engaged with them, fully present, entertaining their ideas, and asking questions.
Their favorite family trip so far?  When we traveled to Arkansas to mine for crystals.  AKA, dig in the dirt all day.  They saw it on a YouTube video. They asked to go.  So we obliged. I had never been to Arkansas.  It&#x27;s beautiful.
We stayed at a resort, Diamonds Old West Cabins, with a huge playground outside the cabins, archery, and a bubble party every evening at 6 pm.
They still talk about that trip.</span>

Food, gambling, etc. are all backed by hordes of brilliant well paid people trying to get you to ruin your life so they make money. On the other side is just regular people like us stressed out trying to survive.
This isn&#x27;t some &quot;freedom&quot; issue, it&#x27;s an incredibly huge power asymmetry and I think &quot;we the people&quot; need protection from these forces</span>

                              <span>The most depressing thing for me is the feeling that I simply cannot trust anything that has been written in the past 2 years or so and up until the day that I die. It&#x27;s not so much that I think people have used AI, but that I know they have with a high degree of certainty, and this certainty is converging to 100%, simply because there is no way it will not. If you write regularly and you&#x27;re not using AI, you simply cannot keep up with the competition. You&#x27;re out. And the growing consensus is &quot;why shouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;, there is no escape from that.
Now, I&#x27;m not going to criticize anyone that does it, like I said, you have to, that&#x27;s it. But what I had never noticed until now is that knowing that a human being was behind the written words (however flawed they can be, and hopefully are) is crucial for me. This has completely destroyed my interest in reading any new things. I guess I&#x27;m lucky that we have produced so much writing in the past century or so and I&#x27;ll never run out of stuff to read, but it&#x27;s still depressing, to be honest.</span>

The thing I’m tired of is elites stealing everything under the sun to feed these models. So funny that copyright is important when it protects elites but not when a billion thefts are committed by LLM folks. Poor incentives for creators to create stuff if it just gets stolen and replicated by AI.
I’m hungry for more lawsuits. The biggest theft in human history by these gang of thieves should be held to account. I want a waterfall of lawsuits to take back what’s been stolen. It’s in the public’s interest to see this happen.</span>

                              <span>Sports gambling has been legal in the UK since 1960. Gambling wasn&#x27;t seriously problematic in this country until 2005, when regulations were substantially liberalised. Pre-2005, sports betting was something that old men did in dingy backstreet shops; post-2005, it became a widespread social phenomenon, turbocharged by advertising and the growing influence and accessibility of the internet.
There&#x27;s a false dichotomy between prohibition and laissez-faire, which the US seems particularly prone to. You&#x27;ve seen similar issues with the decriminalisation of cannabis, where many states seem to have switched abruptly from criminalisation to a fully-fledged commercial market. There is a broad spectrum of other options in between those points that tend to be under-discussed.
You can ban gambling advertising, as Italy did in 2019. You can set limits on maximum stakes or impose regulations to make gambling products less attractive to new customers and less risky for problem gamblers. You can have a single state-controlled parimutuel operator. Gambling does cause harm - whether it&#x27;s legal or not - but it is within the purview of legislators to create a gambling market in which harm reduction is the main priority.</span>

                              <span>Sports gambling, like all gambling, ruins lives. It&#x27;s certainly worth having the discussion about whether people should be able to run a train through their life and the lives of their families via app.
But a much easier argument against sports betting is that it ruins the sports. Players throw. They get good at subtly cheating. The gambling apparatus latches itself to the sport, to the teams and players, the umpires and judges, the sporting organizations. With this much money on the line, it&#x27;s not a matter of if but when games are thrown, cheated -- the bigger the game, the bigger the incentive. It&#x27;s even easier now because of the amount of side/parlay betting that is available. It exhausts the spirit of competition.
Sports gambling is diametrically opposed to sport itself.</span>

                              <span>Faced with two wars, nuclear confrontation, extreme economic inequality, and a climate crisis -- not to mention threats to reproductive rights, forever chemicals, housing shortages, gun violence, and rising educational debt – what do 82% of Republican and 39% of Democratic voters, according to a Pew Research poll, say is the most important issue in the Presidential election? Immigration. A nation of immigrants, with dying main streets, empty classrooms, and labor shortages in key industries, is about to cast its votes based in large part on which candidate can best be trusted to reduce rates of both legal and illegal immigration.

                              <span>The launching of the widespread terror campaign targeting civilians in Lebanon is an integral part of the Israeli war strategy to achieve tactical military objectives. The new Israeli strikes which started on September 17 with the exploding pagers have resulted so far in more than 5000 killed and injured Lebanese.
For the past 11 months, the Lebanese Resistance limited its attacks exclusively to Israeli military bases, in or near, the &quot;Jewish-only&quot; colonies along the Lebanese border. The current Israeli assault was likely planned to take place on September 16 ahead of the aexplosion of the pagers, but had to be postponed due to an unforeseen clash with the visit of Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein. Consequently, Israel may have failed, either due to confusion or technical difficulties, to reprogram the pagers’ activation to another date. More

                              <span>This story starts a long time ago. My wife had just returned from Canada, had finished her PhD, and I was a Software Designer working for one of the founding companies of Silicon Valley, though I was based in Brazil.

I believe everyone here must know what depression is, right? Well, if you don’t know, you can click here and read more about it… Well, what probably some people don’t know is that there is chronic depression, meaning no matter how much you try to improve, change, take medication, find hobbies, or whatever the attempt may be; you will die with depression. And I’ve had it since I was 16, but I’m not going to tell you my age, right (I’m in my 20s, lol).
In the past, I have tried to kill myself, but I was saved by a guy who is a great friend, and at the time, I went to live at his house, to be away from everything and everyone, with my phone turned off, just studying 5/6 hours a day, creatin…</span>

As you&#x27;ve realized, this should have been (and was) obvious for a long time. But that doesn&#x27;t make it any less hypocritical or headline worthy.</span>

                              <span>The problem I have with this is simple and has to do with the lack of separation of entities.
Automattic is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.com is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation IS NOT a competitor with WPEngine.
There is a dispute between Automattic and WPEngine. The resources of Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation should not be leverage in this dispute.
The fact that those boundaries are crossed means that anyone who is in competition with Automattic might have any and all ecosystems that Matt has any control over leveraged against them if they upset Matt or Automattic in any way.
It is very poor taste and changes the perspective of the product. Instead of a professional entity who will engage professionally it is now a form of leverage that a single person could wield against anyone who crosses them.
To be clear these same exact actions can be taken against anyone who insults one individual. This look is embarrassing.</span>

Wow, that&#x27;s brave. Create a wrapper around ChatGPT, call it a lawyer, and never check the output. $193k fine seems like peanuts.

That entity will scrape the internet and train the models and claim that &quot;it&#x27;s just research&quot; to be able to claim that all is fair-use.
At this point it&#x27;s not even funny anymore.</span>

Taken as a whole, OpenAI is now just a for-profit entity beholden to investors and Sam Altman as a shareholder. The non-profit is really just vestigial.
I guess technically it&#x27;s supposed to play some role in making sure OpenAI &quot;benefits humanity&quot;. But as we&#x27;ve seen multiple times, whenever that goal clashes with the interests of investors, the latter wins out.</span>

I often tell clients &quot;The first thing you asked me to do was to move a dining room chair into the living room. Then you asked me to do the same with the toilet. The latter only works if we tear out all the plumbing.&quot;
Non-coders seem to understand these analogies intuitively.</span>

When, of course, it&#x27;s not celebrating them by arming the criminal. Or approving them by letting them go unpunished. And it has been doing so for decades. And live on our TV screens.

 Jean-Baptiste Vidalou, “We Are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle” (Cambridge: Polity, 2023) 
 It’s shameful. The original French publication of We are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle by Jean-Baptiste Vidalou was in my hands since April 2018. Frequently described as “the French Seeing Like a State,” the book explores the art of state making in France. Having been in stimulating dialogues with Jean-Baptiste Vidalou (JBV) since 2018, and being linguistically challenged, I knew the general ideas and points in the book—…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how capable the new 1B model is, considering it&#x27;s just a 1.3GB download (for the Ollama GGUF version).
I tried running a full codebase through it (since it can handle 128,000 tokens) and asking it to summarize the code - it did a surprisingly decent job, incomplete but still unbelievable for a model that tiny: https://gist.github.com/simonw/64c5f5b111fe473999144932bef42...
More of my notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/llama-32/
I&#x27;ve been trying out the larger image models to using the versions hosted on https://lmarena.ai/ - navigate to &quot;Direct Chat&quot; and you can select them from the dropdown and upload images to run prompts.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to have missed this part of the story in all the chaos, but from the NYTimes in March:
Ms. Murati wrote a private memo to Mr. Altman raising questions about his management and also shared her concerns with the board. That move helped to propel the board’s decision to force him out.
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/technology/openai-executi...
It should be no surprise if Sam Altman wants executives who opposed his leadership, like Mira and Ilya, out of the company. When you&#x27;re firing a high-level executive in a polite way, it&#x27;s common to let them announce their own departure and frame it the way they want.</span>

                              <span>&gt; &quot;I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.&quot;
This is now to me the &quot;old school&quot; internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don&#x27;t blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly &quot;Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?&quot;
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it&#x27;s been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don&#x27;t participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these &quot;professional&quot; creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.</span>

                              <span>In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>Hey,
How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …</span>

                              <span>five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn&#x27;t really my choice; the doctor said that they could &quot;try to do some creative billing,&quot; but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i&#x27;m away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i&#x27;m living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i&#x27;ve met so many wonderful friends. i&#x27;ve lost a few. i&#x27;ve bought a car. i&#x27;ve gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i&#x27;ve had more than a few mental health episodes... i&#x27;ve also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i&#x27;ve learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what&#x27;ll happen in the next five!</span>

                              <span>I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.
I don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.
I have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.
this isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.
I don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?
but it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.
do what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.
on my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️

                              <span>Trading activity in benchmark U.S. Treasury securities now concentrates on the last trading day of the month. Moreover, this stepped-up activity is associated with lower transaction costs, as shown by a smaller price impact of trades. We conjecture that increased turn-of-month portfolio rebalancing by passive investment funds that manage relative to fixed-income indices helps explain these patterns.</span>

Remove two screws from the bottom of the phone – easy, I can totally do this!
Soften the glue and pull out the back – hmm, I guess it&#x27;s doable if I can find replacement glue.
Disconnect dozens of cables and parts – wow, it&#x27;s going to be hard to remember how everything goes back together.
Peel off protective foam from motherboard – is it even possible to replace this stuff?
CNC grind the existing 128GB NAND to dust – I should probably stop watching now...</span>

                              <span>Common Crawl is shown in their screen shot of &quot;Providers&quot; along side OpenAI and Antropic. The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it&#x27;s a major source of content for the Wayback machine.
In fact, that&#x27;s the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone&#x27;s site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).
There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don&#x27;t, and that applied whether they are bots or people.</span>

I’ve not… really… spent a lot of energy thinking of a “my time on Cohost” retrospective post like some folks have done (which have all been a pleasure to read!) because I’m not sure I really can. I think it’s easy to pick apart the stuff that’s individually made Cohost such a wonderful place to exist on, and certainly added to the greater whole of the thing, but trying to sum up everything into A Post feels impossible. How do you sum up years of emotion and attachment in a way that’s, like, understandable to others outside your specific lived experience on a website built to let the individual tailor it to their desires.
I tried tackling some of it in my last blog post in a more pointed manner. I’ve been spending a lot more time sorta doomer-think…</span>

It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.
I’ll give you an example.

These are the questions posed by Matthew Graybosch for September&#x27;s IndieWeb Carnival, Power Underneath Despair.
My darkest moment in life occurred about five years ago. For a long time, I understood that something wasn&#x27;t right, but refused to accept it — both for those around me and for myself.
&quot;I&#x27;m handling this myself! I won’t let anyone think there’s something wrong with me, ever. I got this!&quot;
I tried weight training, yoga, meditation, running, seeking spirituality, reading books, attending online events, going on retreats…
While these activities provided some temporary relief, they weren&#x27;t enough. My issues ran deeper. I needed professional help but had the foolish belief that seeking it was a sign o…</span>

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it&#x27;s because i need to promote something or i&#x27;m reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don&#x27;t like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn&#x27;t; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed &quot;posting&quot; on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr&#x27;s design the most) so i&#x27;m unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i&#x27;ll ask them. if i&#x27;m gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i&#x27;ll message them instead of posting into the void.
it&#x27;s all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on because you&#x27;re shouting into the void and they&#x27;re not in it, but you don&#x27;t actively talk to them because there&#x27;s this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i&#x27;m pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i&#x27;m looking forward to never thinking about social media again.</span>

Introductions
Arvind: Hello, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you
like to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with
Kubernetes?
Kensei: Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada
(@sanposhiho), a software engineer at
Tetrate.io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more
than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG-Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of
two SIG subprojects,
kube-scheduler-simulator and
kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.

 “THOMAS PAINE … WAS NEVER ENOUGH of an optimist to let his natural anarchism run its full course.”[1] His contemporary, William Godwin, said in his “Enquiry Concerning Political Justice” (1793), “With what delight must every well-informed friend of mankind look forward to the dissolution of political government, of that brute engine which has been the only perennial cause of the vices of mankind … and no otherwise to be removed than by its utter annihilation.” Paine takes a more negative stance:— “Some writers have so confounded society with government as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only diff…</span>

Title: Anarchy is Love

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…</span>

                              <span>Standard metrics point to an improvement in Treasury market liquidity in 2024 to levels last seen before the start of the current monetary policy tightening cycle. Volatility has also trended down, consistent with the improved liquidity. While at least one market functioning metric has worsened in recent months, that measure is an indirect gauge of market liquidity and suggests a level of current functioning that is far better than at the peak seen during the global financial crisis (GFC).</span>

Title: The Making of the Spanish CNT-IWA (2010–2024)
Date: September 21, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 23rd September 2024 from libcom.org

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside. This (rather incomplete) article resumes the story of that conflict as seen through the eyes of what is now the CNT (CIT).

                              <span>Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).</span>

                              <span>from Lars Syll Based on our interviews, heterodox economics appears to be a positive project, inevitably deﬁned somewhat in terms of the mainstream but not exhaustively so. It is also eﬃcacious, with policy and real-world impact. It is a complex object, not amenable to deﬁnition by a single criterion. Its dimensions are partly intellectual, in […]</span>
