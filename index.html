                              <span>Employers don&#x27;t reward long-term employees because they don&#x27;t need to. Even though everyone knows you make more by job-hopping, companies are following a rational strategy because too few people &quot;walk the walk&quot; despite wanting more salary. Arguably unethical, but rational.
At the cost of losing a minority of job-hoppers they retain the cheap majority that:
    - finds job interviews exhausting, or is anxious about being rejected

    - dislikes conflict or negotiation

    - has good relationships with colleagues they don&#x27;t want to lose

    - has a comfortable commute or WFH arrangement they don&#x27;t want to change

    - is proud of becoming an expert / go-to-person in some part of the business and doesn&#x27;t want to lose that source of social capital

    - is proud of product or service they have made a big contribution to and wants to &quot;see it through to the end&quot;

    - believes leaving would place an unfair burden on other team-members or would be disloyal to a manager they consider a friend

    - (US only) cannot risk losing healthcare

It&#x27;s the same reason why your phone/insurance/whatever provider puts up the prices year-after-year: although some people leave, enough people simply put up with it that they make more money this way. &quot;Do nothing&quot; is an easy choice and companies are banking on enough people making that choice.</span>

&gt; The company is switching to an on-device approach that is more private and works on each phone independently.
They&#x27;re literally harvesting all of your location history, transaction histories, etc. What exactly is more private about doing it on your phone? It&#x27;s not like your entire maps history will be stored on the device exclusively.</span>

                              <span>This is bad advice.
Say I have a user table, and the email is unique and required, and we don’t let users update their email, and we don’t have user deletion. If I’m going natural PK, I make email the primary key.
But … then we add the ability for users to update their email. But it should still be the same user! This is trivial if we have a surrogate primary key, a nightmare if we made email the natural primary key.
Or building on that example, maybe at first we always require an email from our users. But later we also allow phone auth, and you just need an email OR a phone number. And later we add user name auth, SSO, etc. Again, all good with surrogate primary keys, a nightmare with natural primary keys.
There are countless examples like this. You brought up cars, same thing with licence plates, for example. Or even Social Security Numbers/Social Insurance Numbers - in Canada SINs are generally permanent, but temporary residents can have their SIN change if they later become permanent residents, but they’re still the same person.
You want your entities to have stable identity, even if things you at one time thought gave them identity change. Surrogate primary keys do that, natural primary keys do not. Don’t use natural primary keys, use surrogate primary keys with unique constraints/indexes.
I challenge you to come up with a single plausible example where you’re screwing yourself by choosing surrogate PK + unique constraints/indexes. Meanwhile there are endless examples where you’re screwing yourself by choosing natural PK.</span>

It seems to be in the bloodstream, so to speak (as in the endless streams, even rivers, of blood eternally being spilled). And in a sense, war, the urge to take someone else’s territory or simply kill endless numbers of… well, us… has certainly been in that very same bloodstream at least since the first great literary work of the Western world, The Iliad, was written. In some sense, you could say that, 3,000 years later, we’re all still in Troy. More

Figures on the distribution of family wealth provided by the Federal Reserve Board show that when the wealth inequality virus recovers after a downturn, it generally produces new levels of inequality.

                              <span>The police state is interested in maintaining the power structure in the police state. As long as petty or even organized crime does not upset the balance of power, the authorities couldn’t care less - crime against Americans is no danger to them. Just as the  Russian government has no interest in cracking down on its blackhat population, as long as they target non-Russian orgs.</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ve solved the problem with an incorrect assumption.  You have assumed that the ideal situation is to use all of the chips in your collection.  A better solution is to ask, what is the most playable breakdown for the poker games I am playing.  If I am playing 25c/50c no limit hold&#x27;em with 8 players... and a typical buy-in of $20 per player... as an experienced poker host at these limits, I maintain that the ideal breakdown is:
12x 25c
12x $1
1x $5
If you have a set with 100x of white, blue, red, green, etc... your total number of chips used for 8 players is:
96x white (25c)
96x blue ($1)
8x red ($5)
If players lose all of their chips... they can re-buy with $5 (red) chips and make change from the players that have all of the lower denomination chips.
What I have proposed above is a proper solution if you want to play poker.</span>

                              <span>Parsing is an application domain where I&#x27;d expect more hard logic and less soft feelings than in this article.
&quot;I feel that CFGs more naturally represent how we think&quot; but
&quot;All this doesn&#x27;t apply to situations where you trying to parse some language, whose specification explicitly says that the language is based on PEG formalism&quot;
A terrible context free grammar (with left and right recursion, not a small feat) is presented.
&quot;I blindly converted grammar above to Haskell code&quot;
&quot;I accidentally discovered my grammar was ambiguous!&quot;
&quot;All this gave me psychological trauma (figuratively speaking). I will never use Parsec (and PEG parsers) anymore.&quot;
Denial that an ambiguous grammar is a defect, denial that the ambiguity has to be resolved, refusal to use parser combinators to resolve the ambiguity in the correct way.
It&#x27;s also strange to see someone react to a modest, non-shameful failure (guess what, parsing is difficult is language design is even more difficult) that should be a nice learning opportunity (elegant context free grammars are usually insufficient in practical usage) with anger and radicalization far beyond an acceptable level of blaming the tools.
The other post in the blog, however, follows a similar general pattern: never use a popular technique (de Bruijn indices rather than parser combinators), because they advocate another technique (expressing lambda calculus terms with randomly generated globally unique identifiers for all bound variables rather than pure context free grammars) because that&#x27;s what they like.</span>

                              <span>Because this opinion has surfaced a number of times here: Yes, Tolkien did care deeply about the realism of his world. And because he spent his whole life studying pre-modern societies, the societies he creates in Middle Earth do function very realistically. I think there are two reason why many readers miss this:
(1) Much of Tolkien&#x27;s world-building is implicit rather than explicit. He doesn&#x27;t talk about Aragorn&#x27;s tax policy because he doesn&#x27;t need to; Aragorn is recognisably a feudal king and there is a standard way taxes are done a feudal system (i.e. the vassals take care of gathering them). Tolkien has a deep understanding of how such societies function, but much of this comes out indirectly in the story, through the way the characters behave and what they can and cannot do.
(2) Pre-modern societies are so deeply different from modern ones (economically, culturally, and socially) that I think many readers stumble across things they find unexpected and dismiss it as &quot;unrealistic fantasy&quot;, without understanding that in such a context, this is exactly how one would expect the world to work. For example, the deep devotion and self-sacrificial service Sam shows to Frodo is often discussed in terms of friendship (and it is a great friendship), but one cannot fully understand it unless one also understands it as a (very positive) master-servant relationship.
If you want a better understanding of the deeper realism of LotR, I cannot recommend Bret Devereaux&#x27; blog highly enough. He is an ancient military historian and has written extensive (but entertaining!) analyses of both LotR and GoT.

                              <span>I understand the frustration, but at the end of the day I think they do serve a purpose. They&#x27;re not great at that purpose, but they&#x27;re good enough and they generally produce false negatives (smart people fail) rather than false positives (you hire an idiot). And this makes sense, because a false negative is low cost (maybe you spend 50% longer interviewing candidates) but a false positive is high cost (you hire an idiot and have to spend months establishing that, firing them and starting the hiring process again).
The side effect of this though, is that it&#x27;s an extremely painful process for the applicant. Even if you&#x27;re a great software engineer, you&#x27;re going to freeze up, miss something, have a bad day, and fail a few interviews. Now for most software engineers failure is an unusual and harrowing experience, so they react really badly to it. Especially ina 
 scenario where it&#x27;s difficult to blame anyone but yourself. But just don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s fine! just move on, there&#x27;s plenty of jobs and the interview process is a blunt tool, not a final evaluation of your worth in life.</span>

                              <span>Leetcode style interviews probably serve two functions:
1) A way to suppress wages and job mobility for SWE. Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.
2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear/similar objective.
Meet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…
Or is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.
To the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.
I’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree/number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.
Someone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree/number theory/inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.</span>

The best part was that instead of attacking the messenger and denying any problem, Cox seem to have acted like the very model of responsible security response in this kind of situation. I&#x27;d love to read a follow up on what the bug was that intermittently permitted unauthorised access to the APIs. It&#x27;s the kind of error that could easily be missed by superficial testing or depending on the reason behind the bug, perhaps not even experienced in the test environment.</span>

                              <span>My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.</span>

                              <span>Today is one of those days when I feel I have nothing to write.
Then I started thinking...
What is it that says you have to have something to write to start writing? It&#x27;s just an idea, an idea of how things work.
You have something to write.
You write it.
It doesn&#x27;t have to be like that. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.
There are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...
It should be sunny on Midsummer day (it&#x27;s a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).
When life doesn&#x27;t go the way it&#x27;s “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.
What if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things &quot;should be”? What if we face the day with a little &quot;let&#x27;s see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings&quot;?
It&#x27;s worth trying.

                              <span>This is a short story I wrote a while back :
It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…</span>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.</span>

                              <span>Many Americans are celebrating the news of Donald Trump’s conviction on 34 felony charges in a hush-money incident that took place ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Newspaper headlines screamed “TRUMP GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS” and media reports relied on superlatives such as “historic” and “unprecedented” to label the unanimous jury verdict. Given that Trump has been unusually adept at avoiding accountability for a staggering number of alleged crimes, the verdict felt like a long-overdue comeuppance. More

                              <span>Governments worldwide are in a race to see which one can encourage the most women to have the most babies. Hungary is slashing income tax for women with four or more children. Russia is offering women with 10 or more children a “Mother-Heroine” award. Greece, Italy, and South Korea are bribing women with attractive baby bonuses. China has instituted a three-child policy. Iran has outlawed free contraceptives and vasectomies. Japan has joined forces with the fertility industry to infiltrate schools to promote early childbearing. A leading UK demographer has proposed taxing the childless. Religious myths are preventing African men from getting vasectomies. A eugenics-inspired Natal conference just took place in the U.S., a nation leading the way in taking away reproductive rights.

                              <span>More than a desire to restore a supposed national glory, Trump’s quest to “make America great again” is the search for his own “authentic essence.” His narcissism is pathological. He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him. More

During the extremely wet winter a year earlier, the great Tulare Lake had once again overflowed its dams, dikes, levees and ditches, as it does every once in a while despite all the efforts of government and agribusiness, and spread to its full size of 800 square miles just south of the Rancheria, The return of the lake brought new faith and determination to these extraordinary people, who have lived here since long before the coming of the Europeans whom they have barely managed to survive.

                              <span>The article does a decent job of explaining of how Chinese characters work, but it falls short of explaining why.
The reason why Chinese continues to use a logographic writing system is due to both tradition and practicality. English has grossly grouped together Chinese as one unified language, when in actuality it is not. In fact, many &quot;dialects&quot; are mutually unintelligible--one speaker cannot understand another speaker. If all of China switched to using a phoenetic writing system, everyone would write everything differently. It&#x27;d be very difficult--impossible at some points--to read and write materials from other &quot;dialects&quot;. However, with a logographic approach, everyone can understand that the character 工 means &quot;work&quot; even if I pronounce it like [wirk] and someone else pronounces it like [wak], for example. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why subtitles are so prevalent in Chinese media. Obviously, this problem can be eliminated by eliminating individual &quot;dialects&quot;, which is sort of promoted through the adoption of Mandarin Chinese. Many Chinese media is also dubbed in the standard dialect so that actors with regional dialects can be understood.
As for Chinese characters in other languages, Japanese becomes a lot easier to read with the addition of Chinese characters. Kanji allows sentences to be shorter, less ambiguious, and easier to parse. Unlike Chinese, each character is not just a single syllable, and there are many homonyms in Japanese because there&#x27;s a smaller set of sounds.

                              <span>Totally fair question! My reasons were:
1. To maximize Photon&#x27;s battery life I tried to make the hardware do the absolute minimum to record imagery. To that end, Photon stores images on an unformatted SD card (ie one huge linear array of bytes) which is easy and fast to index into.
2. A 16-bit MSP430 handles writing the image data, and the MSP430&#x27;s codespace is 99% exhausted without dealing with the complexities of a filesystem like FAT32, so adding support for a filesystem wouldn&#x27;t currently fit. (This line of MSP430, MSP430FR2433, has a maximum of 16 KB of FRAM, but perhaps I could use a different line.)
3. Photon stores images as RAW image data that require post-processing to view the images. Since I wanted to provide a polished app to view the imagery anyway, I figured I&#x27;d just make it a requirement.
I&#x27;m not saying those are all particularly good reasons, but that was my reasoning anyhow.</span>

                              <span>I think there’s one flaw in the overall theory presented in the article: it was demand for coal for heating independent of the industrial revolution that really kickstarted things and the labor exploited for coal mining was the lowest of the socioeconomic classes. Before the industrial revolution England was already mining around five times more coal than the rest of the world combined just to survive winters. Once they exhausted the easy surface deposits they had to go deeper and deeper which required mechanized power to work against the water seeping in. The first engines were invented not when labor became too expensive but when it was impossible to do with human labor at all.
After reading Coal - A Human History I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs and a surface supply of coal just big enough to get the industry started but not enough to supply the growing population without digging deeper.</span>

Lame ducks can mess around and get away with a lot of things they might not otherwise if they were facing re-election.
I like to use that term to describe the habit I have of completely abandoning my usual routine before big life changes like going to college or starting a new job. This week I&#x27;ve replaced my usual routine of exercise and healthy eating with junk food binges and late bedtimes. Instead of reading and writing before bed I play videogames. I don&#x27;t so much consciously decide to do this as much as I fall into it without meaning to: I think my brain knows that th…</span>

                              <span>The Washington Post’s journalists recently exposed what many already suspected or knew. Donors from society’s richest 1 percent pressured university administrators and political leaders to use police and other means to crush peaceful student protests. The students wanted a change in United States and Israeli policy and action to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Growing numbers of faculty are joining the students’ protests. They too have been unjustly persecuted by the same “authorities.” More

                              <span>I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Synopsis
 How can the link between city and child be made more fruitful and enjoyable for both the child and the city? 
 At a time when a significant proportion of the city’s children are at war with their environment, the question raised by this book becomes ever more urgent for teachers and parents, citizens and policy makers. Through an enormously rich range of refere…</span>

Title: International Workers Aid To Bosnia
Subtitle: Syndicalists truck flour directly to Bosnia unions
Date: December 1994
Notes: This article, from a presentation on June 1993 at the European Syndicalist Conference, appeared in Nov.-Dec. 1994 Industrial Worker newspaper

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.

                              <span>I love my blog! I really do! I want to write every day. But I don&#x27;t. Why? Because of the Perfection Bug!
&quot;You need to share a unique thought&quot;
&quot;Your idea should be worth penning&quot;
&quot;You need to write in great detail&quot;
Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.
But today, I decided to squash that bug!
I don&#x27;t need unique thoughts. I don&#x27;t need amazing ideas. I don&#x27;t need to explain things in detail.
All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all I need to write on my blog.
So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to messing with the blog&#x27;s CSS! I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.
I&#x27;ve also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...
While I&#x27;m deciding, please enjoy the croissant button. It&#x27;s given me more serotonin than it should.</span>

                              <span>If anyone is perplexed or surprised why Americans are so upset about the economy, they should look no further than the Income Distribution and Dynamics in America (IDDA) recent report by the Federal Reserve Board of Minneapolis and its data site that looks at the stagnation of American income and economic mobility in America. It unfortunately confirms what we already know—the neoliberal state benefits unevenly and in ways that confound an ability to challenge it..

                              <span>One of the core responsibilities of central banks is to act as “lender of last resort” to the financial system. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has been operating as a lender of last resort through its “discount window” (DW) for more than a century. Historically, however, the DW has been plagued by stigma—banks’ reluctance to use the DW, even for benign reasons, out of concerns that it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness. In this post, we report on new research showing that once a DW facility is stigmatized, removing that stigma is difficult.</span>

                              <span>Becoming a PhD economist can provide a fulfilling and financially secure career path. However, getting started in the field can be daunting if you don’t know much about the preparation you’ll need and the available job opportunities. If you’re wondering what it means to be an economics researcher or how to become one, please read on. We’ll review how to prepare for a career in economics research, what an economics PhD program entails, and what types of opportunities it might bring. Economic education is a core component of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s mission to serve the community. To empower would-be economists, this post provides information for students who seek a career in economics research. We hope this information will be helpful to students interested in economics, regardless of their background and economic situation.  This information is most applicable to students applying to programs in the United States.</span>

In the months since then, she has not only quit her job, but also somehow gotten engaged AND married (in a courthouse wedding) without telling any of us. What is going on? Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven&#x27;t even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.
This is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I&#x27;ll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through &#x27;husband&#x27; will catch in my mouth and &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; will slip out instead.
Most of this can be chalked up to unfamiliarity. I&#x27;ve been u…</span>
