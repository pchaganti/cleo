                              <span>In an era marked by unprecedented threats to democracy from rising authoritarian forces, universities—once celebrated citadels of democratic learning and public service—now find themselves caught in a profound political and ideological siege. Rather than championing social justice or fostering spaces for rigorous intellectual exchange, many institutions have shifted their priorities to profit, silencing dissent and embracing market-driven models that serve a predatory capitalism, thus betraying their democratic mission. This crisis has deep roots, but the recent onslaught by far-right politicians and a reactionary billionaire elite is without precedent in its intensity and scale. This trend weakens the humanities and liberal arts, stripping higher education of its capacity to serve as a democratic public sphere and robbing it of the potential to cultivate socially aware students who challenge injustices and hold power to account. Increasingly, higher education runs the risk of becoming either right wing indoctrination centers or dead zones of the imagination. More

                              <span>I recently had a horrific dream that transported me from the safety and peace of Vietnam to the blazing hell on earth that is Gaza. I was holding a sniper rifle and in my sights was an IDF soldier. There’s not a shred of doubt in my mind that I would have pulled the trigger had the dream not ended. While I’m a great supporter of non-violence, I also firmly believe in the right of self-defense, including in Gaza where Israel is the invader and a fanatical agent of genocide. More

                              <span>i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since 2008.
they’re mostly self portraits.
his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.
sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.

linus-malmqvist
a couple of things inspire me:
along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.
ex:
18 September 2024 
Onsdag

The logs arrive, I can now start building my house. 

the other thing that encourages me creatively is that he’s been doing this project since 2008. that’s a long time. It astounds me that more people aren’t liking his drawings.
the number of likes on his work doesn’t seem to faze him.
he just continues drawing, sharing his work, and not making things more complicated than they need to be.
he loves to draw, so he does it.</span>

                              <span>The November Ask Me Anything blogging challenge is going well. Today&#x27;s question is once again from @annie@social.lol on Mastodon. She wants to know, &quot;What&#x27;s an important lesson you&#x27;ve learned about relationships?&quot; As a happily married guy, albeit in marriage number four, I feel fully qualified to share my expertise on this one. Anyway, relationships also include friends, work, and more.
High School Sweethearts
I got married the first time to my high school sweetheart. I was 18, she was 17. We already had a baby and had another one pretty quickly to boot. Today, all four of us are doing OK. Getting an early start on children made me a young grandparent able to do plenty of stuff with my huge collection (13) of descendants. Although the marriage didn&#x27;t last long (three years), it did not rui…</span>

                              <span>At a former company, we were all issued YubiKey Nanos, which just never worked for me. None of my coworkers had a problem, but I couldn’t get the damn thing to register a touch no matter what I did, including swapping keys.
 Eventually I came across a thread on an internal list for employees over forty, with several other people who were all having the same problem. The solution? Lick your finger. Gross, but it did the trick. And I’m stuck licking my finger every time I need to make a YubiKey work.</span>

                              <span>4 Years ago.
Depending on who you ask, that might be a lot of time, or just a tiny fraction of their entire life, but one thing is true, a lot can change in that time.
4 Years ago, there was a tiny being, an unknown fella by most people, who was starting to have questions. That tiny being felt like they didn&#x27;t fit anywhere, What was their purpose? Why were they suddenly feeling like this? Are they just overthinking things? They just couldn&#x27;t tell at all.
4 Years ago, these questions were driving them insane, everytime they tried to ignore what was causing them these questions, it would intensify even more, it doesn&#x27;t help things that they barely had friends around that time, friends that could help them with these doubts...
4 Years ago, they gave up questioning this and decided to go inves…</span>

                              <span>I just posted the text below on my Swedish blog. It felt right at the time, but now I&#x27;m not so sure anymore. Welcome to my world of constant ambivalence and confusion.
Follow-up post on November 3: The Upsides of English Blogging
November is a month filled with various blog challenges. I considered participating in one of them, but instead decided to create my own:
Writing in Swedish all month long.
It might not sound very challenging since Swedish is my native language. However, I&#x27;ve only been blogging in English recently.
Taking a break from this routine feels a bit daunting. But I still want to do it to see how it feels and if the content of the texts changes. This is the first text in a long time that I&#x27;m writing in Swedish without considering an English translation.
Even though my English texts are always written in Swedish first and then translated, it&#x27;s not the same. I notice how I adapt my writing to suit the translation. I avoid ordinary language, puns and the like, and I rarely use idioms or metaphors.
The writing becomes stiff and forced. It feels restrictive, boring, and inexpressive. At least that&#x27;s how it feels to me.</span>

                              <span>People always say this guy just has had bad luck with his employers but I live in Melbourne and work in data and reckon the whole industry is a scam.
Like why didn&#x27;t anyone catch the issue with the logs? Because it doesn&#x27;t matter, every data team is a cost-centre that unscrupulous managers use to launch their careers by saying they&#x27;re big on AI. So nothing works, no-one cares it doesn&#x27;t work, most the data engineers are incapable of coding fizzbuzz but it doesn&#x27;t matter.
People always wonder why banks etc. use old mainframes. There&#x27;s like a 0% success rate for new data projects. And that 0% includes projects which had launch parties etc. but no-one ever used the data or noticed how broken it was. I don&#x27;t think a lot of orgs which use data as core-infra could modernize, the industry is just so broken at this point I don&#x27;t think we can do what we did 30 years ago.</span>

                              <span>I like the programmers on here telling the professional users that Excel is overblown and they could just use Numbers, OpenOffice or Google sheets.
Imagine an accountant coming on here and telling you that you don&#x27;t need vi, emacs, sublime text or VSCode. You certainly don&#x27;t need your IDEs. After all it&#x27;s perfectly possible to code in Notepad.
You also don&#x27;t need your languages. BASIC was perfectly good.
The killer feature of Excel for financial modelling,  over &#x27;proper&#x27; software,  databases etc is portability and auditability.
Everything I do at work is subject to external audit. Every audit firm in the world has Excel. The tax advisors have Excel too, as to the tax authorities. Apprentices are trained in Excel. The people I hire may not have used our ERP, but they have all used Excel. It is the one constant in our world. The actual accounting records are in an ERP, but all of the outputs are in Excel. I have worked at several multinationals and several SMEs. Excel was everywhere.</span>

                              <span>&gt;he asked the team, “for this meeting I’d like us to try and introduce ourselves a little differently. If you’re comfortable, I’d like us to try and be 10% more vulnerable than we normally would in a work setting.” I remember feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement rise in my chest. I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was. Some of my coworkers shared deeper things I’d never heard in a work setting. It was awkward. It was beautiful.
I&#x27;d rather not have my manager forcing me to do group therapy. I owe the company some work hours and they own me money.
If I want to have personal relations with someone from my work, befriend somebody, share personal things, that is my choice. My personal life is not the company business.
Of course I wouldn&#x27;t say all that to the manager, but &#x27;I&#x27;ll put him on the list of people I should be careful about, and fake some confessions.</span>

                              <span>Putting concerns about future states aside, congrats to the Pixelmator team. I&#x27;ve been using the app for years and it&#x27;s a really great piece of software, well designed and well built. It&#x27;s always been incredible value for the price, especially given that it basically replaces Photoshop for a wide swath of the market without compromising on UX (which is a problem for other competitors) at a price point that&#x27;s like 1-2 months of an Adobe subscription (I don&#x27;t even know exactly what that costs any more because Pixelmator + parts of the Affinity suite got me out of their clutches).
Adobe must not be stoked about this news. And I&#x27;ll just keep my fingers crossed this all heads in a direction that&#x27;s more Logic than Dark Sky.</span>

                              <span>Is there any way this can go bad?
When Apple acquired DarkSky, they absolutely destroyed a service that I loved and relied on. Four years on, Apple Weather is less reliable than DarkSky, and not even close to feature complete.
But DarkSky was a cross-platform service, whereas Pixelmator is software that&#x27;s already Apple-only. I&#x27;m wondering how much I should be worried, and if I should already be abandoning ship.</span>

                              <span>This might sound stupid but I refuse to go to dentists that have &quot;too nice&quot; of an office.
Over the years I have lived in several places and had a variety of dentists and one common theme that sticks with me, the nicer and higher tech the office is, the more procedures they are going to recommend you. They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow.
I&#x27;ve had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done.
The dentists there took xrays, etc and didn&#x27;t find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong.
When I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums.
This has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill. When i got to college and went to the dentist there, they couldn&#x27;t find a problem.</span>

I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context.
It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter.
Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander&#x27;s family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. Thi…</span>

Today is apparently National Fountain Pen Day. As always, I have no idea who comes up with these holidays, but here I am, fully embracing it. I wish I could do a similar ode to my fountain pens like I did with my cameras during National Camera Day, but I only have one fountain pen, so that would be a very short post. Ask me again next year— maybe I’ll have a different answer by then.
There are also a myriad of writing challenges starting up today, which is super exciting. These are the times when more people are motivated to write, which in turns means more things to read. It’s a win/win for everyone!
The two challenges I have my eye on are:

Some very exciting news in the world of Beastieball: the Early Access release date has been set for November 12th! That&#x27;s like, less than 2 weeks away... I better get everything ready...
Here&#x27;s the trailer!!


But wait, you want more?
Well. Okay.
How about the BEASTIEBALL Original Sound Track? It&#x27;s now up for pre-order on Bandcamp!!
BEASTIEBALL Original Sound Track by Lena Raine

I wanted to take a moment to talk about how I&#x27;ll be releasing the OST, since it&#x27;s my first Early Access game:
When the game first releases, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of music in the game! 61 tracks, with an estimated runtime of around 2 hours 40 mins. That&#x27;s about as much as Chicory had when it released in full! However, there&#x27;s a lot more music we want to add to the game on the road to its 1.0 r…</span>

                              <span>People who blog sometimes share advice, myself included. Advice about life, careers, relationships… anything, really. If it’s something someone has lived through, chances are they’ve got insights to offer. Sure, some might call it unsolicited advice, but you’re free to read it or skip it, so it doesn’t matter much in the end.
Here’s the secret: the advice bloggers give? It’s often as much for themselves as it is for you.
And that’s no surprise. Writing is often called therapeutic, meditative, or an exercise in self-reflection. All of those are true. As we write (as I’m doing right now) thoughts that we hadn’t even realized we had come bubbling up. Sometimes, these thoughts take the form of advice. Advice that’s just as relevant to us as it might be to anyone else.
So, is it a problem that the advice bloggers write is actually for them? I don’t think so. It’s obviously helpful for the bloggers themselves, who apparently needed it in the first place. And for readers, it could be just the advice they’ve been searching for, without knowing it. That’s the beauty of blogging: you can stumble upon a story that really speaks to you. Reaching just one person with a story is already a success.
So go ahead. Write your story, and put it out there for the world to see. There might be someone out there who truly needs to read it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure about you, but for me, the web feels untrustworthy these days. So much of the content is either AI generated or created just to sell something, it&#x27;s really hard to find authenticity online. How do you know what sites to trust? Where do you find quality content?
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for a couple of years now, trying to figure out a solution. I feel like we need to wall off parts of the web. You know, have a gated community to keep the riff-raff out. Of course, that feels a bit icky, and keeps out people who might be looking for a better web. It also creates an echo chamber, and that is another pressing issue with the internet. There is also the logistics of how you could do this. I mean, in a way, Medium does this with a login and blocking of articles and that …</span>

                              <span>Trumpism is capacious. It contains contradictions and absurdities. It borrows from the left and the right. An explosive mix of love and hate propels it. Anyone can afford the price of admission. They only need to embrace Trump, MAGA, and conspiracies.
MAGA was in force on a crisp Sunday afternoon outside Madison Square Garden in late October. I joined tens of thousands of faithful seeking entry to the Woodstock of fascism. The lineup featured some of the worst people in America: Elon Musk, Stephen Miller, Rudy Giuliani, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK, Jr., JD Vance, Tucker Carlson, Elise Stefanik, Trump’s progeny, C-list racists and cranks, and the Demagogue-in-Chief himself.  More

After evaluating some options and writing code in various programming languages and frameworks such as .NET/F#, Go, Rust, React, I eventually decided to write it in Ruby on Rails. Why? Because I was already familiar with Rails and because of that I could literally go 10x faster than I was with any of the aforementioned options that were quite new to me. I told myself that this was temporary, a proof of concept and that later on, I would rewrite it in a different language that wouldn&#x27;t let me shoot myself in the foot as easily as I tend to do with Ruby. The Rails application however quickly grew in functionality and my colleagues really liked the application. I could quickly build features that would make them more…</span>

I always get the itch around the New Year or my birthday to start fresh and to have my blog reflect the most recent version of myself. So, I try and throw everything away so that I can rebuild from scratch.
After a couple of decades of starting a with a “clean slate” online and in my personal life, I’ve come to realize that there is no such thing. A clean slate doesn’t truly exist.
In order to have a clean slate, you would need to erase everything that came before. Sure, I can delete the blogs so the public does not see them, but I still wrote them. I still allowed these ideas and concepts to flow from my brain to my hands and manifest…</span>

                              <span>This is probably Google&#x27;s Altavista moment, by making their results crappier by the year in search of Ad dollars everyone has felt that there is a potential for search to be better and once that becomes available they&#x27;ll be in a continious game of catch-up.
Yes, Google has their own AI divisions, tons of money and SEO is to blame for part of their crappiness. But they&#x27;ve also _explicitly_ focused on ad-dollars over algorithmic purity if one is to believe the reports of their internal politics and if those are true they have probably lost a ton of people who they&#x27;d need right now to turn the ship around quickly.</span>

                              <span>Been thinking about this a lot [1]. Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?
The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple&#x27;s Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.
Combining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.
Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.
I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.

                              <span>Introduction
Recently there&#x27;s a report from Github on the rise of snake language to be the top on Github. Yes, Python overtakes Javascript!

Below is a nice time series graph showing language progression over time:

Inspired by this achievement, I once again write how to speedup Python to almost near C/C++ speed! The tools we are using: Codon and Cython to speedup integrate calculation in Python.
Python code
First lets take a look at the original python code.
def f(x):
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a, b, N):
    s &#x3D; 0
    dx &#x3D; (b - a) / N
    for i in range(N):
        s +&#x3D; f(a + i * dx)
    return s * dx

Fairly simple and straightforward.
Codon code
Now here&#x27;s the Codon version:
def f(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a: float, b: float, N: int) -&gt; float…</span>

                              <span>About six weeks ago, I opened up a Duolingo account. I don’t have a great desire to become bilingual, but I’ve read about all the benefits of learning a new a language and I figured, what the heck. I started with Latin, which I was enjoying, but decided I should switch to something a bit more practical. Being in the United States, Spanish was the logical choice, and so I moved my lessons over to Spanish.
Every day, I take three or four minutes to do my little challenges. It’s been a fun little distraction, but one that occasionally irritates me. For example, I’ve mistyped and lost hearts, which of course, prompts the app to sell me a membership, something I’m not interested in at this time. I don’t allow many notifications from apps on my phone, so Duolingo sends me emails to remind me to …</span>

                              <span>I’ve come to realize that education works best when it’s built around the learner. Not just teaching someone information but lighting a fire in them to seek out knowledge on their own.
That’s when it all changes. When students are genuinely curious, and they’re allowed the freedom to explore that curiosity, they become teachers to themselves.
They’re learning not because they have to but because they want to. That inner motivation is what takes learning beyond just facts and assignments—it makes it something exciting and meaningful.

But how do we actually make this shift? I’ve been thinking a lot about that, especially when I look back on how much public schooling is still rooted in traditional “chalk and talk” methods. A teacher at the front, lecturing while students sit passively—it has…</span>

Today, lots of people were disappointed that a well-liked Internet service, Omnivore, which allowed you to save articles to read later, subscribe to newsletters without using your personal email, and have some articles automatically archived, was turning off its servers on November 15. Some folks had just transitioned to using Omnivore, only to find that their efforts were now wasted. It was my favorite way to read a couple of my favorite writers, so I had to scramble to come up with an alternative.
People have seen it happen time and again. Huge, popular websites and companies have just disappeared or changed so completely…</span>

                              <span>I work for Google, and I just got done with my work day. I was just writing I guess what you&#x27;d call &quot;AI generated code.&quot;
But the code completion engine is basically just good at finishing the lines I&#x27;m writing. If I&#x27;m writing &quot;function getAc...&quot; it&#x27;s smart enough to complete to &quot;function getActionHandler()&quot;, and maybe suggest the correct arguments and a decent jsdoc comment.
So basically, it&#x27;s a helpful productivity tool but it&#x27;s not doing any engineering at all. It&#x27;s probably about as good, maybe slightly worse, than Copilot. (I haven&#x27;t used it recently though.)</span>

                              <span>Mac OS calls home every time you execute an application. 
Apple is well on its way to ensure you can only run things they allow via app store, they would probably already be there if it wasn&#x27;t for the pesky EU.
If you send your computer/phone to Apple for repair you may get back different physical hardware.
Those things very much highlight that &quot;your&quot; Apple hardware is not yours and that privacy on Apple hardware does not actually exist, sure they may not share that data with other parties but they definitely do not respect your privacy or act like you own the hardware you purchased.
Apple marketing seems to have reached the level indoctrination where everyone just keeps parroting what Apple says as an absolute truth.</span>

                              <span>I really respect Apple&#x27;s privacy focused engineering. They didn&#x27;t roll out _any_ AI features until they were capable of running them locally, and before doing any cloud-based AI they designed and rolled out Private Cloud Compute.
You can argue about whether it&#x27;s actually bulletproof or not but the fact is, nobody else is even trying, and have lost sight of all privacy-focused features in their rush to ship anything and everything on my device to OpenAI or Gemini.
I am thrilled to shell out thousands and thousands of dollars to purchase a machine that feels like it really belongs to me, from a company that respects my data and has aligned incentives.</span>

How do people deal with this? I simply don&#x27;t understand the value proposition. Does Google now have 25% subtly wrong code? Or do they have 25% trivial code? Or do all their engineers babysit the AI and bugfix the subtly wrong code? Or are all their engineers so junior that an AI is such a substantial help?
Like, isn&#x27;t this announcement a terrible indictment of how inexperienced their engineers are, or how trivial the problems they solve are, or both?</span>

Very reasonable. Google can flag accounts as CP, but then a judge still needs to issue a warrant for the police to actually go and look at the file. Good job court. Extra points for reasoning about hash values.</span>

New video format or more demanding music software is released that slows the machine down, or battery life craters.
Well, I haven’t had even a tinge of feeling that I need to upgrade after getting my M1 Pro MBP. I can’t remember it ever skipping a beat running a serious Ableton project, or editing in Resolve.
Can stuff be faster? Technically of course. But this is the first machine that even after several years I’ve not caught myself once wishing that it was faster or had more RAM. Not once.
Perhaps it’s my age, or perhaps it’s just the architecture of these new Mac chips are just so damn good.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s not forget that jaywalking was essentially created by the automotive industry and its lobbyists, to make life more convenient for drivers. It started in car-heavy places like California, and eventually became a law virtually everywhere in the US, but was never really enforced in New York City, where most people walk or take public transit, rather than drive. If, like most New Yorkers, you walk several kilometers a day, through dozens of intersections, it&#x27;s ludicrous to suggest that you should only walk at crosswalks, and only when the walk sign is lit. New Yorkers don&#x27;t have a concept of &quot;jaywalking&quot;; it&#x27;s just &quot;walking.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>Hi, I lead the teams responsible for our internal developer tools, including AI features. We work very closely with Google DeepMind to adapt Gemini models for Google-scale coding and other Software Engineering usecases. Google has a unique, massive monorepo which poses a lot of fun challenges when it comes to deploying AI capabilities at scale.
1. We take a lot of care to make sure the AI recommendations are safe and have a high quality bar (regular monitoring, code provenance tracking, adversarial testing, and more).
2. We also do regular A/B tests and randomized control trials to ensure these features are improving SWE productivity and throughput.
3. We see similar efficiencies across all programming languages and frameworks used internally at Google and engineers across all tenure and experience cohorts show similar gain in productivity.

                              <span>As a programmer of over 20 years - this is terrifying.
I&#x27;m willing to accept that I just have &quot;get off my lawn&quot; syndrome or something.
But the idea of letting an LLM write/move large swaths of code seems so incredibly irresponsible. Whenever I sit down to write some code, be it a large implementation or a small function, I think about what other people (or future versions of myself) will struggle with when interacting with the code. Is it clear and concise? Is it too clever? Is it too easy to write a subtle bug when making changes? Have I made it totally clear that X is relying on Y dangerous behavior by adding a comment or intentionally making it visible in some other way?
It goes the other way too. If I know someone well (or their style) then it makes evaluating their code easier. The more time I spend in a codebase the better idea I have of what the writer was trying to do. I remember spending a lot of time reading the early Redis codebase and got a pretty good sense of how Salvatore thinks. Or altering my approaches to code reviews depending on which coworker was submitting it. These weren&#x27;t things I were doing out of desire but because all non-trivial code has so much subtlety; it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.
So the thought of opening up a codebase that was cobbled together by an AI is just scary to me. Subtle bugs and errors would be equally distributed across the whole thing instead of where the writer was less competent (as is often the case). The whole thing just sounds like a gargantuan mess.
Change my mind.</span>

You don&#x27;t just acquire $7T.

Gross Fixed Capital Formation (Net Investment + Deprecation) isn&#x27;t much more: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFIRSAXDCUSQ
Google, Apple, and Microsoft together don&#x27;t even spend $100B on CapEx per year. And they&#x27;re worth almost $10T put together.
Asking for $7T when you&#x27;re a $100B company is so ridiculous it&#x27;s beyond belief.</span>

I find that ai can help significantly with doing plumbing, but it has no problems with connecting the pipes wrong. I need to double and triple check the updated code - or fix the resulting errors when I don’t do that. So: boilerplate and outer app layers, yes; architecture and core libraries, no.
Curious, is that a property of all ai assisted tools for now? Or would copilot, perhaps with its new models, offer a different experience?</span>

 An ‘inimitable singularity’: this is how Ronald Creagh described the American utopian communities he studied for his doctoral thesis. [1] But Ronald himself was also an inimitable singularity. 
 A cosmopolitan by family and culture, with British, Italian, Egyptian roots, he had studied in France and written his MA on the free thought periodicals in nineteenth century North America – after having been a priest for many years. He then turned towards the early anarchist movement; this led him to visit the CIRA library (Centre international de recherches sur l’anarchisme) in Lausanne, in the early ’70s.

 Ronald Creagh took great satisfaction from the fact that he was born in Alexandria, Egypt, a historic city that was the centre of ancient learning. He grew up in a multicultural milieu in Port Said, Egypt. He was the offspring of a British-Sicilian father and a Franco-Lebanese mother and was taught Sicilian by his paternal grandmother. He said that Sicilian was his first language. 
 In 1947, his family migrated to Australia, while Ronald moved to France to become a Roman Catholic priest. He took a degree in sociology at the Sorbonne, a masters’ degree at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, and then taught at the Institute of Human Sciences and Techniques and…</span>

 Longtime French anarchist scholar and activist Ronald Creagh died on September 8 at age 94. 
 He was in touch with anarchists and anti-authoritarians on several continents. Those who knew him personally appreciated his broad-minded openness and supportive spirit. 
 Some Fifth Estate staffers were among those who found him engaging and attentive in conversations on many subjects. In recent years he was a regular reader of our online current and past articles and enjoyed discussing them.

 Given the political crisis that Venezuela is going through and that was manifested in the events before, during and after April 11, we anarchists consider it necessary to state our position. In this regard, therefore: 
 1) Hugo Chavez&#x27;s contradictory policies have not benefited the most disadvantaged sectors of the country, increasing in three years of management the rates of poverty, unemployment and social insecurity. In addition, his government repeats errors and vices characteristic of previous ones. But in no way do the sectors of the current oppositi…</span>

 But still we know that when the Europeans came, the Bushmen lived in small tribes (or clans), sometimes federated together; that they used to hunt in common, and divided the spoil without quarrelling; that they never abandoned their wounded, and displayed strong affection to their comrades.
