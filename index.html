Under threat from Israeli tanks, the parents and siblings of Ms. Kamla (a pseudonym) were forced to evacuate al-Bureij camp and relocate to her central Gaza home in al-Maghazi on December 25, 2023. Three days later an Israeli tank fired a shell into her home, though thankfully their family was gathered in a different room of the house so there were no injuries. Since December 28, Kamla and her family have been displaced 7 or 8 times.
When the Israeli tanks finished their operation, Kamla left the tent she had evacuated to in Dier al-Balah. She went to see if her house was still standing. She found it partially destroyed, yet still she tried to clear the rubble to live in it once more. That was not the end however, as Israel returned with more tanks and bombs.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learned to hate software process.  If you have team sizes set sanely and empower devs to do what they need to do in order to accomplish the goal, they&#x27;ll be fine without the management overhead of arbitrarily imposed productivity flow.  Agile et al, along with 99% of the features in ticketing systems, exist to make managers feel like they are justifying their paycheck.
If you are a manager and this makes you angry, you&#x27;re one of the bad ones.</span>

2) Tell everyone born between 1980 and 1995 that they&#x27;ll be unable to compete in the global marketplace if they don&#x27;t get at least some post-high school education, and imply that the mere presence of a degree will help instead of having a specific type of degree
3) Have next-to-zero standards for public funds used in grant and loan programs for college education, meaning people can take out loans for any sort of degree program at almost any sort of institution
4) Hold these debtors to standards that aren&#x27;t applied to other types of debtors. You cannot discharge them through bankruptcy, it&#x27;s very difficult to renegotiate, and SCOTUS has said that the chief executive of the note-holding institution (in this case, the President of the United States) cannot use discretion in deciding who he gets to forgive for loans.</span>

                              <span>Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.
I work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it&#x27;s able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many &quot;problem shapes&quot;. For instance, I can give it a logic problem like &quot;i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially&quot; and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.
Yes, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.
side: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.
Many of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.</span>

                              <span>A common comment when it comes to blogging is that people don&#x27;t know what to write about. There&#x27;s even a dedicated &quot;What to blog about?&quot; category on the Blog Inspiration page.
While I understand that many feel this way, the &quot;problem&quot; for me is rather the opposite: I have so many ideas that I don&#x27;t know which one to choose. And on those rare occasions when I&#x27;m completely out of ideas, I write even if I have nothing to write about.
My biggest source of inspiration is everyday life. Even the most trivial moments carry something interesting. It could be something someone says or does, a certain environment, or something I&#x27;m engaged in:
A podcast.
A book.
A song.
A documentary.
A movie.
It&#x27;s swarming with blog posts waiting to be written, if we&#x27;re just paying attention. When such a potential post crosses my path, I usually make a note, a voice memo, or take a photo, depending on what&#x27;s easiest in the context. Currently, there are two photos and three notes waiting to become blog posts.
Of course, this setup doesn&#x27;t suit all types of blogs. But I dare say that it&#x27;s an approach that works for the majority of bloggers.
How has your day been? What have you experienced? What people have you met? What have you seen, read, and heard? What thoughts have popped up?
Start writing, in your own way, and share it.
It&#x27;s your blog. There are no rules.</span>

                              <span>I am a bit conflicted when it comes to the subject of work and having a work ethic. On one hand, I live in the least unionized state in America and retired from a career as a state employee where we were forbidden by law from engaging in collective bargaining, a law that was created to stop white and black workers in Charlotte from organizing together back in the 1950s. On the other hand, I believe in not being a burden on my co-workers and in the benefits of taking on hard tasks.
My mother was the daughter of a tobacco farmer in Southeast North Carolina. She grew up doing manual labor. Although she is now a retired intensive care nurse, she didn&#x27;t go to nursing school until I was in my teens.

An anti-quota students&#x27; movement developed into a broader rebellion against the Awami League (AL), led by Sheikh Hasina, and her despotic government. The students achieved this victory after a fierce struggle which witnessed more than 400 people killed and thousands of others injured or reported missing. The turn of events in (...)

    command -v tput &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; [ -t 1 ] &amp;&amp; [ -z &quot;${NO_COLOR:-}&quot; ] || tput() { true; }

This little snippet of setup lets you sprinkle tput invocations through your script knowing that it&#x27;s going to do the right thing in any situation.</span>

                              <span>Found out that the CrowdStrike Mac agent (Falcon) sends all your secrets from environment variables to their cloud hosted SIEM. In plain text.
Anyone with access to your CS SIEM can search for GitHub, aws, etc creds. Anything your devs, ops and sec teams use on their Macs.
Only the Mac version does this. There is no way to disable this behaviour or a way to redact things.
Another really odd design decision. They probably have many many thousands of plain text secrets from their customers stored in their SIEM.</span>

Except the biggest IT outage ever.  And a postmortem showing their validation checks were insufficient.  And a rollout process that did not stage at all, just rawdogged straight to global prod.  And no lab where the new code was actually installed and run prior to global rawdogging.
I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s smoke, and numerous accounts of fire, which this can be taken in the context of.</span>

                              <span>Okay this is just getting suspicious. Their excuses for keeping the chain of thought hidden are dubious at best [1], and honestly just seemed anti-competitive if anything. Worst is their argument that they want to monitor it for attempts to escape the prompt, but you can&#x27;t. However the weirdest is that they note that:
&gt; for this to work the model must have freedom to express its thoughts in unaltered form, so we cannot train any policy compliance or user preferences onto the chain of thought.
Which makes it sound like they really don&#x27;t want it to become public what the model is &#x27;thinking&#x27;. This is strengthened by actions like this that just seem needlessly harsh, or at least a lot stricter than they were.
Honestly with all the hubbub about superintelligence you&#x27;d almost think o1 is secretly plotting the demise of humanity but is not yet smart enough to completely hide it.

Here are basically people paying, and paying a lot, for parasocial relationships. Because clearly it’s not about the content per see which is a dim a dozen and available for free in trove.
I think it says something quite dark about our society as a whole that we have basically commoditised distress and are encouraging some people often themselves in dire circumstances to prey on others to the benefits of the middle men. I find these new pimps scarier than the old sort in that they pretend to have clean hands.</span>

That’s the problem: it’s a _terrible_ intern. A good intern will ask clarifying questions, tell me “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure I did it right”. LLMs do none of that, they will take whatever you ask and give a reasonable-sounding output that might be anything between brilliant and nonsense.
With an intern, I don’t need to measure how good my prompting is, we’ll usually interact to arrive to a common understanding. With a LLM, I need to put a huge amount of thought into the prompt and have no idea whether the LLM understood what I’m asking and if it’s able to do it.</span>

                              <span>Boeing spent $43B on stock buybacks between 2013 and 2019 while paying their CEO ~$30M/year.
&gt; To support its share price, the company under McNerney poured billions into stock buybacks instead of investing profits into the kind of research and development needed to stay competitive. McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.
&gt; McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.
&gt; McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)

                              <span>The failure is in how you&#x27;re using it. I don&#x27;t mean this as a personal attack, but more to shed light on what&#x27;s happening.
A lot of people use LLMs as a search engine. It makes sense - it&#x27;s basically a lossy compressed database of everything its ever read, and it generates output that is statistically likely - varying degrees of likeliness depending on the temperature, as well as how many times the particular weights your prompt ends up activating.
The magic of LLMs, especially one like this that supposedly has advanced reasoning, isn&#x27;t the existing knowledge in its weights. The magic is that _it knows english_. It knows english at or above a level equal to most fluent speakers, and it also can produce output that is not just a likely output, but is a logical output. It&#x27;s not _just_ an output engine. It&#x27;s an engine that outputs.
Asking it about nuanced details in the corpus of data it has read won&#x27;t give you good output unless it read a bunch of it.
On the other hand, if you were to paste the entire documentation set to a tool it has never seen and ask it to use the tool in a way to accomplish your goals, THEN this model would be likely to produce useful output, despite the fact that it had never encountered the tool or its documentation before.
Don&#x27;t treat it as a database. Treat it as a naive but intelligent intern. Provide it data, give it a task, and let it surprise you with its output.</span>

13 facts and things I love about Cocoa1
The way she lights up when she&#x27;s excited, doing those adorable hoppity hops to express her joy.
Typically, she grabs her closest toy, runs away, and then circles back when she&#x27;s excited—her unique way of releasing cute aggression.
Those little licks (kisses) as she passes by, letting me know she&#x27;s thinking of me and loves me.
When we&#x27;re hanging out on the couch, she always has to be touching me somehow, usually making sure her butt is pressed against me. Bonus points if she&#x27;s touching both LC and me at the same time.
The constant smell of Fritos, as if she&#x27;s working overtime at the Frito factor…</span>

                              <span>hello! it&#x27;s blogging time.
now that cohost is shutting down, i&#x27;m setting up a new home for whatever long-form (or even medium-form) writing i do. i&#x27;ve found over time that the microblogging formats of most social media don&#x27;t really work for me, and i like having ownership / control of my writing. so here we are.
i&#x27;m spending some time migrating some of my favorite posts over from cohost to here; you can view them in the #cohost tag if you so wish.
i&#x27;m planning to write more about my overall Feelings around the cohost shutdown soon; there&#x27;s a lot of things i&#x27;d do differently if we were to do it again, but i&#x27;m proud of what we accomplished regardless.
one thing that i&#x27;ve been contending with in the wake of the shutdown announcement is the outpouring of love for cohost that i&#x27;ve gotten from s…</span>

As someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.
Active alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I&#x27;d been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours. I was never the kind of person to keep beer in the fridge for later or to maintain a bar so that I could m…</span>

                              <span>I did not think I would ever be spinning a blog again. I think I did in the, like, pre-Google Blogger days? Or something? I was 14. I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.
This will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized &quot;here&#x27;s an important update&quot; kinda thing but that&#x27;s a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don&#x27;t think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.
So here&#x27;s a blog. How often will I post here? I don&#x27;t know! I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s actually kind of nice! I don&#x27;t need to give a shit about it. It&#x27;s a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don&#x27;t need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!
Subscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.
If you&#x27;d like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.
Thanks for reading and if you&#x27;re coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active. The community there was something I&#x27;ll cherish forever.</span>

                              <span>As we head towards COP 29, the issues of climate finance and a fossil fuel phaseout towards a just energy transition are ever more critical for climate action. The upcoming UN General Assembly, the UN Summit of the Future and the Global Renewables Summit all taking place one after the other in September provide an important opportunity to reiterate our demands and escalate public pressure to compel governments, international institutions and corporations to listen and take action.

Almost 60% of AIPAC’s money comes from corporate CEOs and other top executives from Fortune 500 companies. The largest single donor to the United Democracy Project is Jan Koum, the multibillionaire former CEO of WhatsApp and a regular Republican funder. The biggest institutional contributors to UDP come from FIRE, finance/insurance and real estate sectors. More

                              <span>The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More

Kennedy and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, leading to a series of arms control and disarmament treaties beginning with the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963.   More

                              <span>The day after the debate, I woke up to the resounding evidence that Harris had floated like a butterfly over the proceedings and occasionally had stung the hapless Trump like a bee. He, I was assured, had done no better on tariffs, Gaza, Ukraine, abortion, climate change, or January 6 than he had with his eloquence over the Springfield protein diet. Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

                              <span>The very notion that it is acceptable to tie one&#x27;s health in a civilized nation to having ample cash is clearly anathema to most of the world, but it&#x27;s the way things are in the United States. Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More

                              <span>This is incredible. In April I used the standard GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to help me reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol used by my kitchen fan to integrate it into Home Assistant.
It was helpful in a rubber duck way, but could not determine the pattern used to transmit the remaining runtime of the fan in a certain mode. Initial prompt here [0]
I pasted the same prompt into o1-preview and o1-mini and both correctly understood and decoded the pattern using a slightly different method than I devised in April. Asking the models to determine if my code is equivalent to what they reverse engineered resulted in a nuanced and thorough examination, and eventual conclusion that it is equivalent. [1]
Testing the same prompt with gpt4o leads to the same result as April&#x27;s GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) model.
Amazing progress.

                              <span>The reason that I&#x27;ve heard used repeatedly is that a shocking percentage of folks who aren&#x27;t Technology producers can&#x27;t separate visual quality from &quot;doneness&quot; of a project. If you show some business folks something that looks like it works, they&#x27;ll mentally update the project to &quot;Nearly done!&quot; and then everything else after that becomes &quot;Unreasonable delays.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In short, the Voyager spacecraft were designed (after considerable design and operational experience from Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft) to be able to operate for a long time largely automatically without too much hand-holding. All major systems are multiply redundant and may be remotely turned on and off. While there has been personnel turnover on the program, it has not been of a magnitude to jeopardize program continuation. Finally, program management has been media savvy and well politically connected ensuring that operations are still funded. (Contrast with other missions such as Magellan to Venus which was deorbited while it still had propellant reserve leaving some portions of the planet unmapped)
JPL has (or had?) a &quot;retiree badge&quot; program that permitted retired staff to continue to access their office. Many programs benefited from highly knowledgeable personnel essentially continuing to report to the office every day without pay (not being paid comes with the luxury of not having to worry about being laid off if your charge accounts don’t have enough funds!) It was an absolute privilege to learn from these people.</span>

                              <span>I love the idea of a digital garden. I first heard about them in an article by Maggie Appleton where she wrote:
Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.
I’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  It&#x27;s a place where I can experiment with creative projects and test new ideas.
Some Examples
This week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.

Neither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.
I also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.
I’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.
Over time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.
None of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.
What are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?</span>

                              <span>Hello!
Once again I have abandoned my Substack. Will, you say, you&#x27;ve done this before. And, sure, yes. Last time I bailed on Substack I migrated to Blogspot, but I didn&#x27;t really like the platform much. This platform is much simpler, a lot less busted, and has RSS and Atom feeds. I also like that it has no trackers or JavaScript.
I&#x27;ve had some weird feelings about maintaining my own Substack for a while now. I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m personally cut out for the platform: I don&#x27;t have a single subject I can write about consistently (and, to be honest, I don&#x27;t think I can really write consistently at all); I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s massively metrics-based as I really don&#x27;t care about that sort of thing; I don&#x27;t like the constant push to monetize when I&#x27;ve never had any intention of doing that; and, honestly, I was kind of running out of things to say. The fiction I posted just felt like filler so that people would remember the blog existed at all. Sad!
I&#x27;m not entirely sure what&#x27;s going to go here yet but I&#x27;m excited to have what feels like a rather cozier corner of the internet than Substack or Twitter. I&#x27;ve also been remaking my website from the ground up to be less of a professional presence and more of a personal one. I&#x27;ve been having a great time with it. Stay tuned.</span>

hi! i’m Lena Raine. i’ve written the music you may have heard in indie games such as Celeste &amp; Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and slightly larger games like Minecraft &amp; Guild Wars 2.
i have also written and designed a visual novel called ESC, and am currently working on a brand new game called ANOTHEREAL. i’ll be introducing the game &amp; talking about its development in these little blogs, so stay tuned if you want to find out more!
separately, i’ve also been known to blog about games, music, and other things that interest me. i had an ongoing series of longer posts on the website Cohost, which I’m no longer able to continue due to it shutting down. i hope to use this blog to keep the long-form posting alive. so if you like(d) reading my thoughts on games and other media, those will continue here as well!</span>

                              <span>well, here we are again. this time in a new space. less eggbug, less (immediate) community… but still a place for me to put words &amp; hopefully have some degree of long-form posting that i’m comfortable with.
i was contemplating setting up a newsletter, and that is well and dandy, but ultimately there’s a lot of baggage that comes from blasting out emails to everyone’s inboxes every time i want to write something on a whim. that’s not necessarily what i’m here for!
i&#x27;ve done my best to port over &amp; fill out the archive with some of my game blogs and other ‘best of’ from cohost, tagging those where appropriate! and then we’ll keep on going… i hope you’ll stick around, subscribe to the rss or atom feed, whatever keeps you updated!
so if you’re new here, have a little dose of introduction:
hi! i’m lena raine. i’ve written the music you may have heard in indie games such as Celeste &amp; Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and slightly larger games like Minecraft &amp; Guild Wars 2.
i have also written and designed a visual novel called ESC, and am currently working on a brand new game called ANOTHEREAL. i’ll be introducing the game &amp; talking about its development in these little blogs, so stay tuned if you want to find out more!
separately, i’ve also been known to blog about games, music, and other things that interest me. i had an ongoing series of longer posts on the website Cohost, which I’m no longer able to continue due to it shutting down. i hope to use this blog to keep the long-form posting alive. so if you like(d) reading my thoughts on games and other media, those will continue here as well!</span>

                              <span>I am aware I&#x27;ve been navigating heavy topics in recent blogposts - childhood trauma, depression, and mental health in general. On Bear, I have regularly shared light, easily digestible reads, like slices of life and productivity takes. But I have also shared the brutal reality of living with mental health struggles.
I created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist&#x27;s advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.

                              <span>I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.
There came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.
I continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.
While I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.
I’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.

 1. the vandalism of capitalist propaganda 
 2. subvertising; parodies of advertisements 
 3. protest art to hide advertisement. 
 Our main goal is removing advertisement from the public space. 
 As citizens we should have a say in how our public space looks, we do not accept government renting out the space to some companies, that is supposed to be for all of us. 
 We accept bus stop advertisement as a method to support the bus stop. But there is no excuse for stand alone advertisement in the public space, in this zine we will show some tactics to rem…</span>

Abstract
 The article explores the theoretical complicities between the thought of Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille. Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized. In this way, through an analy…</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>David Chang is a salesman and a businessman first. I get the point being made, but keep in mind that he is a brand, and part of that is the stories he tells.
He has slapped his name on so many subpar food goods that were a total disappointment that I actually have started avoiding things marketed under his brand name.
He might do things the hard way in his restaurants, but they certainly aren&#x27;t ensuring tasty or high quality goods under his brand. I would rather he do things in a way that makes sense and provides the best tasting food.
More broadly, the point is that you should take advice only from people whose successes you want to emulate. The actual advice I get out of this article is:
Tell stories that paint the picture you want your customers to have about your product.</span>

That felt like a huge breach of privacy.  Given that equifax had already proven incompetent at keeping my data secure, I immediately sent HR a request to stop sending my supposedly &#x27;confidential&#x27; pay info.  They politely told me to kick rocks, so I went on TWN&#x27;s website and froze that report so no one would be able to request it, and it will be a cold day in hell before I thaw it.</span>

                              <span>I have never heard of Pave before, but this just sounds like yet another copy of Equifax&#x27;s &quot;The Work Number&quot; [1].  Basically, HR at many companies gives your salary and employment history data to Equifax, who then sells access to the information to certain parties with supposed need to access it, including potential and current employers and creditors.  This report is likely one of the most invasive consumer files out there for many people.
I cannot comment on the legality of this kind of data sharing, but as I and others have pointed out, it has existed for a while.  I do agree that it is concerning.  You can freeze your Equifax The Work Number report at least, just like other credit reports.

                              <span>Obviously there are a lot of errors by a lot of people that led to this, but here&#x27;s one that would&#x27;ve prevented this specific exploit:
&gt; As part of our research, we discovered that a few years ago the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD migrated from whois.dotmobiregistry.net to whois.nic.mobi – and the dotmobiregistry.net domain had been left to expire seemingly in December 2023.
Never ever ever ever let a domain expire. If you&#x27;re a business and you&#x27;re looking to pick up a new domain because it&#x27;s only $10/year, consider that you&#x27;re going to be paying $10/year forever, because once you associate that domain with your business, you can never get rid of that association.</span>

 There is but a simple difference between the standpoint of those collectivists who believe that it is useless to vote to abolish the right of inheritance after having voted &quot;for collective property, and that of those collectivists who think, as do we, that it is useful and even necessary to do so. 
 They place themselves entirely in the future and, taking collective property as their point of departure, discover that there is no longer any good reason to be concerned with the right of inheritance.

 We have stated from the very start that the beginning of a full-scale war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 is an imperialist aggression of the Russian state. That is still true. 
Our position on the war in Ukraine
“Autonomous Action” is not on the side of the Ukrainian state — and not on the side of any other state. However, in the current circumstances, the victory of Russia is not beneficial to the peoples of neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor Belarus. Fighting against Russian aggression is now beneficial to everyone except the Kremlin. It is easy to see why it is beneficial to the Ukrainian authorities. But why is it also beneficial to people (and, accordingly…</span>

 Born in 2013, WARZONE DISTRO free zine project, stands at the intersection of nihilist, anti-civilization anarchy, and total liberation, bridging gaps between veganism, straight edge, and insurrectionary thought. WARZONE DISTRO is dedicated to challenging the very foundations of oppression, wherever it festers, and in whatever form. 
 In our interview below, we delve into the radical philosophy driving WARZONE DISTRO, exploring how they blend anarchist and vegan ideals to craft a vision of true total liberation. We talk about the unique ch…</span>

 Along the horridly neglected path out of being commanded and subjected, from the stinking bowels of the societies of oiled gears, permanent emissions, bright screens, information haze and ceaseless masturbation to worn-out sensibility, there arises a shrill hissing of such stupid nature, of such whining entitlement, that the lone rebel catches herself snickering — then nearly dying laughing . . . 
 &quot;You have a left-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a right-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a centrist bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have an extremist bias!&quot;

 “Modernity as a concept means time, the present. There are different moderns, depending on the age. From Sumerian modernity to Roman modernity, and even before and after them, there have been…many examples of modernity.” 
 Abdullah Öcalan, The Sociology of Freedom
 “The Negro’s revolutionary history is rich, inspiring, and unknown. Negroes revolted against the slave raiders in Africa; they revolted against the slave traders on the Atlantic passage. They revolted on the plantations. The docile Negro is a myth… The only place where Negroes did not revolt is in the pages of capitalist historians.”

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursi…</span>

                              <span>This post will be very plain. That is because Bear Blog is excellent in a way that is obvious and requires little explaining.  Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.
It pleases me that Bear Blog doesn&#x27;t have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals. In fact, if you look at its roadmap, you will notice that…</span>

The site then sat there and did nothing, but that was fine, because I didn&#x27;t need to have an actual blog, I had cohost1 for any kind of longer-than-a-tweet writing I wanted to do.
Then two things happened.
First, I got nervous about social media. I feel weird about the way it works and the kind of interaction it encourages, and especially the way endless feeds hijack my ADHD brain. I decided to put all my accounts essentially on hold, including my cohost, and not post for a while, figuring I&#x27;d come back eventually. In the mean time, maybe I&#x27;d start blogging again?

                              <span>I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).
And then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.
Ever since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.
Yesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.
Although I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.
It was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.
And if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.

                              <span>The year is 2024. Social media is melting down and locking down their content behind increasingly expensive APIs. Websites are increasing ads to a ridiculous degree because they aren&#x27;t as profitable as they used to be. The first 5 articles on top of Google are garbage created using AI specifically tuned to maximize search engine optimization. 90% of comments on that one review you read are astroturfing accounts trying to sell you something. Youtube still cannot stop the &quot;pu$$y In BIO!!&quot; spam comments.
The bad news everyone figured out is that the internet is getting more chaotic and buckling under the stress of spam and bot accounts running around everywhere. The worse news is that nobody knows what to do about it.

                              <span>Part of the reason I sadly stopped running any exit nodes was law enforcement harassment.
I ran a few exits for about about ~5 years. In those 5 years, my hosting provider (DigitalOcean) received 3 subpoenas for my account information.
The first two were random. The 1st one was someone sent a bomb threat email to a university. The 2nd one was someone sending a phishing email.
The last and final subpoena was the most serious one. Some nation-state hackers from Qatar had ended up using my exit IP to break into some email accounts belonging to people they were interested in and spied upon them and stole some info.
Thankfully both the Tor Project and the EFF were able to help me pro-bono. The EFF lawyer that was assigned to me helped me fight this subpoena but ultimately we had to turn over my account information to the DOJ + I had to give an affidavit stating that I was simply just an operator and nothing on the server in question would be useful to their investigation (by design).
The stress of having to deal with law enforcement, lawyers, and having to entertain the possibility of having my home raided over something so silly ultimately led to me finally shutting down my exits.
Even though I had all of my exits using a reduced exit policy and I would blacklist known malicious IPs and c2/malware infra from being able to use it, I was still a target.
I feel law enforcement realizes this is a big weakness they can target since a lot of Tor exit operators are individuals with not a lot of resources to fight them. They can use the legal system to scare operators into shutting down.
I one day hope to resume running exits as I find it rewarding to be able to help people from around the world in a small way.</span>

                              <span>For non-EU readers, note that taxation is explicitly not a competency of the EU (i.e. Ireland can set its tax levels to whatever it wants). The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn&#x27;t, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists.</span>

Abstract
 The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…</span>

Title: Anarchists Against Counter-Revolution
Date: 9/7/2024

 There has been a disturbing trend within anarchism in the last few years. It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. 
 The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently &#x27;anarchist.&#x27; 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to &#x27;anarchist&#x27; batt…</span>

 Note: The present passage was written on 11-16 December 2002 (period of the Cyprus entry into the European Union) by anarchist prisoner Giorgos Garakasian in the jails of free Cypriot democracy. 
 Through the general secretary of United Criminals Kofi Annan the Americans and British have been attempting for some time now to impose a ‘fair and viable solution’ upon the inhabitants of Cyprus. 
 The period that we are living in is characterized by the reorganization of global dominion, which has completed its first phase of ‘anti-terrorist’ hysteria with the devastating intervention in Afgha…</span>
