This competition generates a dynamic hierarchy of states, with the most powerful at the top, middling or sub-imperial powers beneath them, and oppressed nations at the bottom. No hierarchy is permanent. Capitalism’s law of uneven  More

My consumption tendencies are not unique to me. The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it.

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.</span>

Title: Native American Anarchism
Subtitle: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism
Date: 1932
Notes: What is meant by ‘Native American’ in the title is ‘local to America’, not ‘indigenous American’. The text undoubtedly still contains many OCR errors that are hard to find without reading the entire book. Finally, some text appears missing through errors in how the book was originally published, such as a paragraph ends naturally with a period at the end of page 112, but then begins half-way through a sentence at the beginning of page 113 (“exchange and recognized that money”).

Subtitle: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon
Date: January 28 2024
Notes: This zine is a transcription of The No State Solution: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon, a live and recorded event which took place on January 22, 2024 in unceded Lekwungen territory in so-called occupied “Victoria, BC, Canada.” While a few grammatical errors have been fixed, we did our best to stay true to the original transcript of our speakers. It is not to be confused with Shuli Branson’s No State Soluton (2023).

 For Soren, 
who taught me the value of a leap. 
 “What we are dealing with here is another version of the Lacanian ‘il n’y a pas de rapport’: if, for Lacan, there is no sexual relationship, then, for Marxism proper, there is no relationship between economy and politics, no meta-language enabling us to grasp the two levels from the same neutral standpoint, although—or, rather, because—these two levels are inextricably intertwined.” 
 — Slavoj Zizek

 Democracy has been the American religion since before the Revolution —from New England town halls to the multicultural democracy of Atlantic pirate ships. But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic? And if the tools of our democracy are not working to solve the rising crises we face, how can we —average citizens— make change happen? 
The Democracy Project tells the story of the resilience of the democratic spirit and the adaptability of the democratic idea. It offers a fresh take o…</span>

Author Rudolf de Jong (born 1932) studied political and social-science, and since 1960 works at the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam. He has published books on the Spanish Civil War and articles on anarchism, Latin America, and Spain. A summary of his essay on Provos and anarchists appeared in the Autumn 1967 issue of Delta. The present article is translated by Elizabeth Wentholt-Haig.

                              <span>&gt; When told of my upcoming case, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand, being in perfect health, unaccustomed to suffering and therefore easily disconcerted by the thought of death, I was horrified. My attitude toward death was like that of a young person standing blindfolded and tied to a post, awaiting a volley from a firing squad. The whole concept made my blood run cold. Yet the case also aroused in me a feeling of relief. Simply put, there was no risk of malpractice, as my patient was already dead. Many anaesthesiologists have such self-centred thoughts when taking care of ASA 6 patients.
&gt; After we moved her from the gurney to the operating table, the doctors and nurses, so used to taking care of living patients, stared at one another stupidly, as if not knowing why they had come together or why they stood around the table.
Sorry this strikes me as embellishing for the case of writing a story.
Background: I was a neurosurgery resident at a level 1 trauma center. I was involved in determining brain death (though the final certification was by an attending surgeon). I worked closely with the transplant team. I declared (normal) cardiac death many times. I had many agonizing conversations with families about withdrawal of care.
Anesthesia is a 4 year residency. Even the 2nd year anesthesia residents I worked with had more of an awareness and lack of naivety that this author shows.
And the OR teams were much more prepared and professional than this. They knew what they had to do and why they had to do it.
If there are other physicians here, I would love to hear your opinions, but this whole piece strikes me as overwrought and full of embellishments to make a certain point.</span>

Thank you. This middle ground between hyperscaler infrastructure and super simple web apps is where most of my career has been spent, yet the recent trend is to pretend like there are only two possible extremes: You’re either Facebook or you’re not doing anything complicated.
It has an unfortunate second order effect of convincing people that as soon as they encounter something more complicated than a simple web app, they need to adopt everything the hyperscalers do to solve it.
I wish we could spend more time discussing the middle ground rather than pretending it’s some sort of war between super simple or ultra complex.</span>

                              <span>People intuitively jump to the conclusion that the problem is caused by a lack of building. While more building would help, a lack of it isn&#x27;t the main cause of this problem.
Ask yourself, do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Britain, Ireland, etc, all have the same inability to build or is there maybe some other common cause?
In my view this is symptomatic of a more fundamental issue - global asset price inflation driven by a broken financial system (i.e. a system being artificially pumped up with cheap credit). Housing is just where the rubber hits the road and regular lives are directly effected. Just look at the tight correlation between the increase in the money supply and property prices.
For those who insist that the number of properties is inadequate, take a look at the numbers for each of the countries I mentioned in the first chart here: https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-cons... (Total number of dwellings per thousand inhabitants, 2022 and 2011).
This is a problem of underutilisation in my view. Too many properties are being used as investments and not as a primary residence.
Cheap credit causes an increase in demand. This is not demand for homes but additional &#x27;artificial&#x27; demand for properties as investments. Think short term rentals, second homes, land banked properties, etc. By definition, only investment properties can be underutilised - owner occupied homes are occupied! So in an environment that encourages property investment you will see more underutilisation.
What will cause prices to fall is higher interest rates. This is what has been happening in NZ.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Just use the normal session mechanism that comes with your web framework and that you were using before someone told you that Google uses jwt. It has stood the test of time and is probably fine.&quot;
You don&#x27;t need to be Facebook or Google to have more than one service in your infrastructure that needs to authenticate a user&#x27;s existing session without forcing the user to log in again. Sharing the session across multiple services is its own distributed systems problem with numerous security implications to be aware of and bearer tokens might be a good alternative.
If all you have is a single monolith web app that is the identity provider, makes all authentication decisions etc then yes, you don&#x27;t need JWTs probably. There is a huge gap between that and being Google/Facebook.
Apart from that, Google and Facebook don&#x27;t even use JWTs between the browser and backends after the initial login but actually do have some sort of distributed session concept last time I checked.</span>

Whereas they just hook up an IR lamp and use the exact same lighting control procedures every stage tech knows blindfolded. Brilliant!</span>

                              <span>I’m not surprised — tattoo inks are not regulated and the colors are often formed with  toxic compounds (e.g. copper).  Then the needle avoids the protective barrier provided by the skin.
Ironically, while working on a drug program that involved intradermal injection, we needed to tattoo the injection site so we could find it later. The FDA was very demanding that both the procedure and more importantly to them the dye would not have any effect that might alter the body’s response to the compound under test.  We had to do a whole study just to validate this.
So the FDA is concerned about this issue for guinea pigs, but is barred from investigating the effect on humans.  All they can do is publish advice on their web site.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Authorize&quot; and &quot;Authenticate&quot; are excellent words. They go back to medieval times and haven&#x27;t changed meaning too much.
Everybody knows what an &quot;authority&quot; is. It means they have power or capability.
Everybody knows what authentic means. Something that is proven to be genuine.
The difference between the two concepts, as they are used in crypto systems are specific, important to get right, and also inherently intertwined, confusing, and subtle. I&#x27;m skeptical that changing the words would help.
It&#x27;s one of the many reasons we have the saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t roll your own crypto.&quot;

                              <span>One thing that may have an impact on the answers: you are hiring them, so I assume they are passing a technical interview. So they expect that you want to check their understanding of the technical stack.
I would not conclude that they over-engineer everything they do from such an answer, but rather just that they got tricked in this very artificial situation where you are in a dominant position and ask trick questions.
I was recently in a technical interview with an interviewer roughly my age and my experience, and I messed up. That&#x27;s the game, I get it. But the interviewer got judgemental towards my (admittedly bad) answers. I am absolutely certain that were the roles inverted, I could choose a topic I know better than him and get him in a similarly bad position. But in this case, he was in the dominant position and he chose to make me feel bad.
My point, I guess, is this: when you are the interviewer, be extra careful not to abuse your dominant position, because it is probably counter-productive for your company (and it is just not nice for the human being in front of you).</span>

                              <span>I played a party game where you had to describe surviving a deadly scenario (&quot;your car went off a bridge&quot;) and a LLM would decide if your answer would work or not. A few rounds in we found the best strategies where answers like:
I escape happily. I do not perish.
There&#x27;s a small blocklist of obvious words like &#x27;survive&#x27; and &#x27;die&#x27;; but once you get blocked on those, it&#x27;s a tell that this strategy will work with the right unblocked synonyms.
Basically if you ever find yourself adversarial with a LLM, figure out The Game and directly subvert it. There&#x27;s no amount of propositions that can prepare it for human ingenuity at the meta level.</span>

                              <span>When I was hiring data scientists for a previous job, my favorite tricky question was &quot;what stack/architecture would you build&quot; with the somewhat detailed requirements of &quot;6 TiB of data&quot; in sight. I was careful not to require overly complicated sums, I simply said it&#x27;s MAX 6TiB
I patiently listened to all the big query hadoop habla-blabla, even asked questions about the financials (hardware/software/license BOM) and many of them came up with astonishing tens of thousands of dollars yearly.
The winner of course was the guy who understood that 6TiB is what 6 of us in the room could store on our smart phones, or a $199 enterprise HDD (or three of them for redundancy), and it could be loaded (multiple times) to memory as CSV and simply run awk scripts on it.
I am prone to the same fallacy: when I learn how to use a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Yet, not understanding the scale of &quot;real&quot; big data was a no-go in my eyes when hiring.</span>

95% of businesses never become unicorns, but that&#x27;s the goal for most (for the 5% which do). If you don&#x27;t plan for it, you won&#x27;t make it.
That&#x27;s exactly what every architecture astronaut everywhere says. In my experience it&#x27;s completely untrue, and actually &quot;planning for success&quot; more often than not causes huge drags on productivity, and even more important for startups, on agility. Because people never just make plans, they usually implement too.
Plan for the next 3 months and you&#x27;ll be much more agile and productive. Your startup will never become a unicorn if you can&#x27;t execute.</span>

What many might not know is that Svalbard is home to the northernmost satellite station in the world. It is just one of two stations that can communicate with polar orbiting satellites each day. ESA and NASA as well as other civilian organisations are present there, and the station communicates with well over a hundred satellites, and are pretty vital for much of the satellites that look back at us.</span>

Financed by agribusiness, these advertisements portray a virtuous cycle, showcasing images of contented rural workers amidst soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar cane plantations, as well as happy urban families. They are all content because they can feed, clothe themselves, and fuel their cars, thanks to the agro-industry.

                              <span>Last night, as I watched a YouTube video, the backdrop featured white wax jambu trees in a field. Seeing those Jambu flowers took me back to my childhood visits to my friend J&#x27;s home.
During my childhood, I often went to J&#x27;s place on weekends to play video games. Afterward, we would head to the nearby playground to play cricket with his local friends. When we returned, we would wash up using the outdoor tap next to a huge white wax jambu tree in J&#x27;s backyard.
During peak season, that tree was laden with jambu fruits. Being curious kids, J&#x27;s aunt or mother would help us pick the fruits using a long-handled fruit picker. Mostly, his aunt assisted us, gently guiding us to the ripest jambus high in the tree branches.
J&#x27;s aunt was like family to me. Though older than our mothers, she had never married. She doted on her nephew J and always welcomed me, addressing me affectionately as &quot;mone&quot; which means son in Malayalam. I fondly remember weekends spent at their home, enjoying her delicious home-cooked meals.
Fast forward several years after I moved away for college. J called me with devastating news - his beloved aunt had been diagnosed with cancer. I was in shock. During my next weekend visit home, my mother and I made a trip to see her. Sadly, not long after, the cancer took her life. Losing someone so full of life and love at a young age was deeply distressing.
Last night, as I gazed at those white jambu flowers on my screen, memories of that gem of a lady and our carefree childhood days flooded me with profound nostalgia and sorrow. Jambus will always be a poignant reminder of happier times and that kind soul who left us too soon.</span>

i didn&#x27;t. this must have been close to eight years ago. 

another friend, who first introduced me to haikyuu!!, quickly chimed in with a &quot;no, she asked me the exact same thing in history club. right before we watched magic mike xxl.&quot; that last bit could have been a joke, though it probably isn&#x27;t. regardless, i didn&#x27;t really remember it either. sophomore year was surprisingly busy for me, so i imagine i must have spent the rest of that period catching up on sleep.

                              <span>I have been listening to JRE for a long time. There are some common themes. Chimpanzee obsession, humans as biological boot-loaders for AI, and looking at people as babies.
The last one is a powerful idea. Basically in your day-to-day interaction when someone is being really difficult and mean, the first instinct is to be mean back to them. To put out the fire with fire. It never works out. A great idea is to pause and visualise them as babies. I personally visualise them as little kids throwing a fit.
How do you deal with such kids? You are gentle and firm as the situation requires. Maybe discipline them in the right way if needed. Look at their viewpoint and try to align incentives. Maybe you are in the wrong?
The point is, if a little kid is mean to you, you don&#x27;t take it personally. People (generally) are not mean to little kids back out of spite. You don&#x27;t hold grudges against them.
It is an awesome framework that does wonders for your peace of mind. Do give it a shot.</span>

The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask.
The game technically wasn&#x27;t even mine. At this point, it was still my mother&#x27;s hobby and I was mostly watching her play.

                              <span>From the look of the counter-protesting, the goals look fairly obvious. First, counter-protesting presupposes that the Mideast world was a tidy and peaceful place on October 6th and that Iranian and Lebanese proxies simply created a need for power and dominance to defend “good states” (US, Israel, Saudi Arabia) from “bad states” (Yemen, Iran, Syria) on October 7th.  As reported by journalist Joshua Frank, one Columbia professor’s motivation to counter-protest wasn’t based on any intellectual argument at all but rather significant familial ties to arms manufacturing.

University backlash ended up only amplifying support for the movement as media flocked to the shantytowns, while faculty, parents and alumni rallied around the students. Students, in turn, rebuilt their encampments. Joining them were supporters from beyond the university: musicians, politicians, and New Left and Black Power activists. The presence of feminist political activist Angela Davis, counterculture activist Mario Savio, poet June Jordan, writer Amiri Baraka and Pan-Africanism organizer Kwame Ture helped draw further national attention to student demands.

I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor...

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

                              <span>I just want to say that this is really actually kind of mind-blowing from an audio engineering perspective.
Outputting audio from multiple laptops in the same room is easy. Perfectly syncing it is harder. Implementing echo cancellation across all of that is quite a bit trickier than regular single-device echo cancellation.
But then treating all the laptop microphones as a kind of microphone array, having to deal with sync issues and phase issues and background noise issues... that&#x27;s hard core.
Kudos to the engineering team on this one. This is actually pretty amazing.</span>

                              <span>Meet, to me, is the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity (as an end user). And features like this only make that more apparent.
Zoom and Teams always frustrate me, even though they&#x27;re what I use far more often.
It&#x27;s too bad that video conferencing is largely a game of who has the most boxes checked - IT admins and A/V folk are the ones that need to be convinced, and Meet just doesn&#x27;t ...meet... their needs</span>

                              <span>As far as I can tell, the issue with this is:
OP runs a casino/gambling site.  Gambling is a regulatory mess (I have spent far too long dealing with this as an RNG supplier), and so it&#x27;s very hard to comply with every jurisdiction, and each one needs you to prove compliance to operate in that jurisdiction.*  Gaming companies spend a lot on compliance and tracking, but since the internet is the internet, it&#x27;s pretty hard to enforce perfectly, so some countries and ISPs take this into their own hands.
Due to that, IPs hosting gambling and gaming sites often get regionally blocked by internet providers or otherwise flagged as hosting illegal content.  Those regional blocks consequently affect the reputation score of the IP, and if you are a traffic aggregator like Cloudflare, can cause other customers to have issues.  One of the most aggressive and annoying regulatory environments for gambling companies is the US, so it&#x27;s very possible Cloudflare has had some trouble due to gambling use of their IPs in states in the USA.
Cloudflare wanted them to use the BYOIP features of the enterprise plan, and did not want them on Cloudflare&#x27;s IPs. The solution was to aggressively sell the Enterprise plan, and in a stunning failure of corporate communication, not tell the customer what the problem was at all.  The message from Cloudflare should have been &quot;Enterprise plan + BYOIP or ban, and maybe we&#x27;ll work with you on price&quot; but it was instead &quot;you would really like the Enterprise plan.&quot;
*As an aside - we&#x27;re lucky in that respect being a tech supplier with relatively uniform rules, but our customers (the gaming companies) get the short end of the stick here.</span>

                              <span>The way Cloudflare approaches situations like this is not ideal for anyone.
You start using the service and don&#x27;t pay a lot, so you make plans around a certain level of expenses. Then out of the blue you receive an &quot;urgent&quot; email from a sales representative and suddenly you have to go from $20 or $250 to $thousands right away.
Obviously it&#x27;s not in CF&#x27;s interest to keep a customer that doesn&#x27;t pay enough, but dropping a &quot;bomb&quot; on the customer and make them feel like they&#x27;re about to be kicked out from the service makes the customer lose trust on CF.
CF can probably match Fastly&#x27;s price. If they had acted differently in this and other similar situations, they could keep the customer, be paid more, trust wouldn&#x27;t be affected, and there would be no bad PR here.
Since the CF management that posts on HN usually say this is not supposed to happen, perhaps someone needs to sit down and look at the incentives sales reps have? Even if you don&#x27;t care about the customers, this is affecting the CF brand a lot.</span>

                              <span>I have been hearing stories from developers/entrepeneurs about Cloudflare being very weird to deal with:
&quot;We&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enterprise plan.&quot;
&quot;No thanks, I&#x27;m fine with the free plan.&quot;
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enteprrise plan.&quot;
&quot;Is there a traffic limit on the free plan?&quot;
&quot;No, there is no limit. But based on your traffic, we require you to get an enteprirse plan.&quot;
[Gives up and gets an enterprise plan]
[6 months later]
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about up&#x27;ing your enteprise plan to a new monthly pay.&quot;
&quot;Is there a cap to traffic in our current plan? I don&#x27;t see that in our terms.&quot;
&quot;No, there is no cap to traffic in cloudflare plans, but based on your traffic, we&#x27;re going to require you to pay more per month than you are currently paying.&quot;
&quot;OK, can you tell me the traffic limit in our current or new plan? So I know what I&#x27;m paying for and when I&#x27;m approaching it?&quot;
&quot;No. But you need to pay more.&quot;
[Wash, rinse, repeat, every 6-12 months]
It seems like while cloudflare technically does not charge for egress, in fact for large egress it&#x27;s just a game of chicken between the customer and a salesperson every 6-12 months, with the salesperson trying to figure out the most they can manage to get without losing the customer? I mean, I guess that is standard for enteprise sales, but I think usually you at least have some terms to know what you&#x27;ve got for how long without a renegotiation?</span>

                              <span>Hmm. My take is the casino structured its business to comply, not to evade interest.

                              <span>In December 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO World Health Assembly established an international body to negotiate a convention, agreement, or other international instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. The negotiations have been difficult. Furthermore, the focus on public health in the Pandemic Agreement remains fragile before the World Health Assembly starting on the 27th of May 2024.

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>

hacks? Don&#x27;t tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.
First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>

                              <span>You may have noticed a proliferation of a new essayist archetype on the internet in recent years - the &quot;Mini Navals.&quot; Modeled after angel investor, entrepreneur, and philosopher Naval Ravikant, these mini me&#x27;s desperately want to become the next big thought leader by aping Naval&#x27;s pithy, maxim-filled style. Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress &quot;wisdom&quot; into a handful of tweets and blog posts.
Most Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval&#x27;s entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it&#x27;s usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.
Sometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don&#x27;t need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.</span>

Title: QUEER – AN ANARCHIST DECONSTRUCTION
Date: 05/19/2009
Source: http://afed.org.uk/queer-an-anarchist-deconstruction/

 So to be queer by its original meaning [1] , isn’t something necessarily offensive, yet still the term evokes great reaction from both supporters, who view the word as self-empowering and those who view the word as somehow offensive. But there is an overt and positive movement that seeks to reclaim what it is to be queer; removing from it, its old meanings of peculiarity and its homophobic connotations and replacing them with a coherent socio-political and intellectual theory that has shaped the politics of gender and sexuality immeasurably. 
 Growing out of the sexual-radicalism of the 1990s (in the USA namely) the word queer has come to …</span>

                              <span>This past Saturday, my little family and I went to Den Haag to vote in the 2024 South African National Election. An experience that has stayed with me all week, eventually morphing into this post.
We arrived at the embassy at 11:00, expecting to be there no more than two hours. Truthfully, we really weren’t prepared for what awaited us.
A common joke (read truthism) among expats is that it’s incredibly easy to identify a South African embassy as it’s generally the only embassy with burglar bars, uncut grass and a queue outside. Walking through the doors of a South African embassy is like walking through a portal linked directly to The Department of Home Affairs in Bellville. It&#x27;s quite a surreal experience actually.
The queue on Saturday was something else. It wrapped around several blocks…</span>

                              <span>Some photographs from the Chinese city of 沈阳 (Shenyang).

I could spend all day browsing these five-story malls. This one boasted restaurants, cafes, daycares, basketball courts, go-karting, and live fish.

Fine dining in 沈阳. These are the food models in the lobby. Outside the frame, my mom is fighting with my aunt and uncle-in-law first to pay the bill, and when she loses that battle, to order fewer items. Lots of 客气 to go around. 

Although it may look the part, those flowers are not lavender. You can&#x27;t see it here, but the whole time we were in Shenyang it looked as though it were snowing. I later learned that the &quot;snow&quot; was actually the seed hairs of the willow and the poplar trees. It looks cool until the fuzz gets in your eyes, on your clothes, everywhere. (source)
老北市
A popular night market in 沈阳 which runs every night. If you&#x27;re there at the right time, you can catch the show with flying drone-powered phoenixes shooting fireworks from their wings. Sadly I don&#x27;t have any good photos of that show — my senses were overwhelmed for most of the night (in a good way).










Night markets have been ruined for me forever. How can anything measure up to that? Not to mention we passed two markets en route to 老北市 that also looked better than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.</span>

                              <span>The term skill issue is thrown around Twitter a lot. It comes from gaming culture. If you can&#x27;t beat a level. It is a skill issue. Just level up and win. If you think about it, it is a powerful term. It gives power to the player.
Applied to life everything is a skill issue. Can&#x27;t do the perfect juggle? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t write awesome distributed performant code? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t convince a penguin to try your awesome new ice cream? You guessed it. Skill issue. It is a powerful mindset. Gives you extreme ownership.
But there is a catch. Do you take ownership of other people&#x27;s shitty behavior? No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don&#x27;t need the negativity in your life.
Here the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context. In a more personal context, things are a lot more messy. I don&#x27;t have an answer for that which works. A skill issue on my end. Need more life experience to resolve it.
Make everything a skill issue and just level up!</span>
