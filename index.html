                              <span>Due to the Internet being out at the house yesterday, we decided to venture out and touch grass. It was also an excuse to take a break from an endless amount of weekend cleaning and life admin stuff for the house.
A few photos of our Sunday stroll filled with bubble teas and empanadas in and around Berkeley, CA.

Despite her facial expression here (she hates the camera), Cocoa is actually indeed enjoying the car ride.

I&#x27;m in love with this itty bitty white car.

Cha Thai Tea with a 4.8 ⭐ Yelp rating and rightly so. We got the Mango Coco (whole mango with homemade coconut milk) and Mango Cloud (whole mango with cheese cloud).

I mean... LOOK HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS! It was even more delicious than it looked.

I thought it said milkshake but was then corrected after a closer look.


We got hungry after our bubble tea outing and decided to go to another place that sold more bubble tea. We didn&#x27;t get any though. We decided to try their empanadas instead.

Kuboba Spot is yet another place with a 4.8 ⭐ rating on Yelp. Limited seating outside + street parking.

Filipino Empanadas FTW. We got Embotido (pork meatloaf), Chicken Adobo, Cheeseburger (weekend special) and Kaldereta (Beef Stew).</span>

                              <span>Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I&#x27;m trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.
If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it&#x27;s the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I&#x27;m trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.
Simon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.
I keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I&#x27;ve received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.
Knowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board. He then wrote each of these messages out by hand (suffering only minor carpel tunnel) on sticky notes which the bear now carries like a human bear directional.

It now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.
These are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they&#x27;ve been listened to and understood. That don&#x27;t cost much money but are priceless at the same time.
I&#x27;m grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you&#x27;re subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.

In addition to overfishing, where necessary species are removed from the food chain, and accelerating biodiversity loss, unsustainable industrial development along coastlines has also contributed to ocean pollution. “All of these threats erode the capacity of the ocean to provide nutritious food, jobs, medicines, and pharmaceuticals as well as regulate the climate,” stated a 2020 article in the journal Nature. “Women, poor people, Indigenous communities, and young people are most affected.” More

If you shine a flashlight through a tree blowing in the wind and vary the brightness to convey information, the signal can get distorted pretty easily.
However, if you have a constant brightness source and vary the color, it’s a lot easier to figure out what the source is trying to convey.</span>

What would be the benefit to updating legacy protocols to just use NL? You save a handful of bits at the expense of a lot of potential bugs. HTTP/1(.1) is mostly replaced by HTTP/2 and later by now anyway.
Sure, it makes sense not to require CRLF with any new protocols, but it doesn&#x27;t seem worth updating legacy things.

                              <span>Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;
The &#x27;chopsticks catch&#x27; was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.
The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn&#x27;t the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.
The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.
The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I&#x27;d guess there are even more &#x27;views&#x27; than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.
I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their &#x27;massive&#x27; Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in &#x27;full reuse&#x27; mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.
Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y&#x27;all did good.</span>

                              <span>MIMO and nonlinear control theories are probably some of the hardest topics in all of engineering. SpaceX control system also has to compensate for the fuel moving inside their rockets so the control algorithms probably involve some kind of fast numerical fluid simulation.
Another interesting thing SpaceX is doing is to use consumer-grade chips in triple redundancy configurations instead of using $100,000+ radiation-hardened aerospace/defense grade chips.</span>

These are forms of productivity growth. They allow more goods and services to be produced for each hour of human labor. Productivity growth is usually thought of as a good thing. […]</span>

records on my walls as art
sometimes it feels like a battle to exist and be who you are.
These days, I feel criminally uncool. I open the Substack app, read a plethora of girlhood essays, and realize they no longer feel relatable.
After watching ​His Three Daughters (a brilliant movie), I thought about my dad and the dynamics within my own family as he was dying. We all grew up with a different dad and experienced a different relationship with him, which seems so bizarre. I also thought about his clothes. Did his wife throw them all out? What about his deathbed pajamas? Are they hanging up at the Goodwill? He&#x27;d probably be very disappointed in me for not having a job right now. He&#x27;d call me lazy.
started watching the new Marilyn Manson doc series. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m so surprised by what was revealed. Disappointed, disgusted, and pissed off to lose yet another musician/actor I like to the pits of shitty behavior.
I wish there were more indie-print literary magazines.
I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of Mina Le vids while eating dinner on my living room coffee table. (My kitchen table is overrun by my unfinished jigsaw puzzle atm)
Life has felt a little shaky lately. I feel like I&#x27;m on the precipice of so much change: moving in with my boyfriend (?), finding/starting a new job, and living out of the city (can I be a country girl?)

Ever heard the phrase: &quot;It works on my machine!&quot;? This phrase encapsulates a common frustration in modern application deployment, where developers often encounter inconsistencies between their local environments and those of their colleagues or production servers.

For instance, Dev A might run the application flawlessly on their PC, while Dev B struggles to replicate the same success, even with the exact same workflow and dependencies. These discrepancies, due to OS differences, software versions, or configurations, cause delays and increased troubleshooting.
Docker
Docker resolves this issue by offering a consistent environment via containers. By bundling the app and its dependencies, Docker ensures uniform execution across machines, eliminating the &quot;it works on my machine&quot; …</span>

Noam Chomsky ranks among the leading intellectual figures of modern times and has changed the way we think about what it means to be human, revolutionising linguistics and establishing it as a modern science. He agreed to discuss just some of his ideas with Radical Anthropology. 
 Noam Chomsky is institute professor and professor of linguistics (emeritus) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. would be a miracle that my granddaughter reflexively identified some elements of the blooming buzzing confusion as language-related and went on to acquire capacities of the kind that you and I are …</span>

 Philosophy is nothing but a landscape of perspectives, worldviews, and paths, some meandering and some straightforward, some solitary and some crisscrossing with the neighboring paths, some long and some short, some trekked in multitude and some in solitude, some forgotten and some revered, some new and some ancient, all to understand and nourish the abilities and needs of self and a myriad of others. Being is becoming, the traveler and the path both change in the journey. Yet, even if the destination is all the same, not all paths are suitable for all. One needs to stay true to oneself and the path’s needs and abilities. To each according to…</span>

                              <span>This is not a tense but a grammatical mood, it&#x27;s called the inferential mood. A bunch of languages have it to distinguish eyewitness accounts from reported speech.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_mood
Verb tense has to do with an action&#x27;s relationship to time, mood expresses the speaker&#x27;s relationship and attitude to the action. English is pretty low on moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive), while other languages have a more fun arsenal.</span>

                              <span>Reported this exact bug to Zendesk, Apple, and Slack in June 2024, both through HackerOne and by escalating directly to engs or PMs at each company.
I doubt we were the first. That is presumably the reason they failed to pay out.
The real issue is that non-directory SSO options like Sign in with Apple (SIWA) have been incorrectly implemented almost everywhere, including by Slack and other large companies we alerted in June.
Non-directory SSO should not have equal trust vs. directory SSO. If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO.
SIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time.
SSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same. You need to take this into account when designing your trust model. Most services do not.</span>

They created a fake band called &quot;Zendesk Alternative&quot; just in an attempt to pollute the Google results if you search for an alternative to Zendesk.

Incredible. This must be some kind of &quot;damaged ego&quot; or ass-covering, as it&#x27;s clearly not a rational decision.

                              <span>It sounds like the author got stiffed by Zendesk on this bug, $0 due to email spoofing being out of scope.
The $50k was from other bug bounties he was awarded on hackerone.
It&#x27;s too bad Zendesk basically said &quot;thanks&quot; but then refused to pay anything. That&#x27;s a good way to get people not to bother with your big bounty program. It is often better to build goodwill than to be a stickler for rules and technicalities.
Side note: I&#x27;m not too surprised, as I had one of the worst experiences ever interviewing with Zendesk a few years back. I have never come away from an interview hating a company, except for Zendesk.</span>

                              <span>I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.
For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.
I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.
There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.
This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.</span>

                              <span>People really like to talk about writing, don&#x27;t they? I don&#x27;t personally mind it, in fact I like writing too, but it feels like every other post that is on the trending tab is about either blogging or writing or Bearblog.
It&#x27;s quite barebones, and I wish it would be simpler to talk to bloggers. Not many blogs have a comments section, and if I want to talk about their post, I may have to email them or go onto a different social media platform to do so. I know I don&#x27;t have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I&#x27;ll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.
Rubidium hasn&#x27;t been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.
Blogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it&#x27;s far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.
It was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it. Fame isn&#x27;t an issue, and I like that.

                              <span>Blog is a text-form media. It is literally just about putting your thoughts out there for a few people to read. On the Bear Blog you are free to write whatever the fuck you want. You can write poetry, write your to-do lists, plan your D&amp;D campaign, anything. Anything you want, including bizarre shit your mind is telling you. It is anonymous if you want to. If you already have a blog tied to your real identity, create another one, just for incoherent rumblings about something that bothers you. Indescribable shit. It can be a sentence long. Even one word. Be yourself. Be a schizo. Be a prophet.</span>

                              <span>Before this blog, I&#x27;d pondered the idea of starting a Patreon or a newsletter of some sort. I liked the idea of doing a semi-regular thought or artdump, and the idea of people wanting to tune into said dumps. But I always hesitated for two reasons.
One was that I didn&#x27;t do anything on a schedule, and if I did do something regularly, I&#x27;d stop as soon as it became a task on my to-do list.1 And two was that I&#x27;ve developed a habit of wanting to escape my audience if I knew it was there – worse if I knew who was in it. The awareness made it difficult for me to write or draw or post freely, always thinking about how it would look and if it was good enough and if the people I knew were watching would be offended.
RSS comes as a relief for the overly self-conscious me. While not knowing who is rea…</span>

                              <span>A few days ago, I wrote about a growing idea to split this blog into two. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with this &quot;behind the scenes&quot; for a few days, and now I have an even better understanding of what the right path is for the moment.
The blog will remain as it is.
It became very clear as soon as I started practicing the new idea. It felt forced, limited, cumbersome, and...boring.
I began to ponder which text would fit on which blog. I considered which blog I should prioritize. And what would I do with things like the newsletter and guestbook?
More and more unanswered questions accumulated...
Everything indicated that the best course of action would be to stay put for now. I had more or less decided when a text by Kev Quirk appeared in my feed: Why Have Multiple Blogs?
That settled it! The final piece fell into place.
For the time being, this blog will continue to cover everything from Swedish Fika and Cinnamon Buns to Blog Tattoos and Writing as Meditation.
All in one delightful mess.</span>

This brazen assault comes after a year of attacks on UN aid workers in Gaza, killing more than 300. After it has bombed UN food and supply convoys, UN health clinics, UN schools and refugee camps. After it has banned UN investigators from entering Gaza and threatened UN courts and prosecutors. All with the shameful acquiescence of Biden, Blinken and Harris.

every now and then, i&#x27;ll pull out my sketchbook to doodle something, or sketching stuff in MS Paint, or whatever. i&#x27;m trying to keep my creative skills engaged, even if it&#x27;s in small amounts. but man... it&#x27;s rough. i keep fantasizing about drawing beautiful illustrations, and not having the physical strength to do anything about it.
i&#x27;m accustomed to this cycle, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less miserable, you know? i can&#x27;t even begin to count how many times i&#x27;ve been through this. my best coping method for this dreaded cycle is to avoid beating myself up over it, try to be patient and forgiving with myself, and chip away at projects when i&#x27;m able to.
it feels kind of embarrassing to keep reposting art from my archives, though. i&#x27;ve been posting art to mastodon/bluesky, since i&#x27;m trying to rebuild my online presence in a post-cohost world. and... i desperately wish i had newer pieces to show. it&#x27;ll happen when it happens - i shouldn&#x27;t risk pushing my body further when i&#x27;m already in a lot of pain - but i still feel sad about it.
just gotta take a deep breath, and be patient. in the meantime, i&#x27;d like to take the downtime to study art styles i find compelling. i&#x27;ve gravitated towards 90s anime fantasy art for years, despite my shockingly-minimal exposure to anime, so it&#x27;d be fun to study some artbooks. and maybe i&#x27;ll take the time to work on more weird little web projects - we&#x27;ll see.</span>

                              <span>I know there&#x27;s a big &quot;well if you could do it better, why don&#x27;t you just do it then???&quot;-type defense towards people who criticize Cohost, as if they&#x27;re trying to critique the work of a football player or an artist. But I don&#x27;t think those are fair comparisons because many, many white-collar, nine-to-five workers have to navigate the same issues the Cohost staff did, which validates some of these arguments (not all, I&#x27;ll admit).
This isn&#x27;t a blog post about Cohost paying themselves salaries, but more about the actual work prioritization and team management skills. I&#x27;m not really interested in talking about their salaries because I understand they have to eat obviously, and if they weren&#x27;t willing to work on Cohost as a side-project while having full-time jobs, then there was really no optio…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on tirzepatide (Mounjaro) for 4 months now. I&#x27;m down 13% of my body weight. I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I&#x27;ve kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I&#x27;ve started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.
All this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it&#x27;s time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I&#x27;m forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.
I say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I&#x27;ve had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don&#x27;t know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.</span>

                              <span>Agreed on hoping this is the inflection point, but only partial agreement that it&#x27;s about adblock.  For sure Google wants adblock to die, but I think it goes even deeper than that.
I think it&#x27;s part of a much bigger trend in tech in general but also in Google:  Removing user control.  When you look at the &quot;security&quot; things they are doing, many of them have a common philosophy underpinning them that the user (aka device owner) is a security threat and must be protected against.  Web integrity, Manifest v3, various DoH/DoT, bootloader locking, device integrity which conveniently makes root difficult/impossible, and more.
To all the engineers working on this stuff, I hope you&#x27;re happy that your work is essentially destroying the world that you and I grew up in.  The next generation won&#x27;t have the wonderful and fertile computing environment that we enjoyed, and it&#x27;s (partly) your fault.</span>

&gt; Firefox, however, has no plans to deprecate MV2 and will continue to support MV2 extensions for the foreseeable future. And even if we re-evaluate this decision at some point down the road, we anticipate providing a notice of at least 12 months for developers to adjust accordingly and not feel rushed.[1]

                              <span>Classic bait and switch setup. Selling people the future in 2 years time with little to nothing to show for today. Timelines will slip, plans will change, software won‘t be ready, prices will change. And that doesn’t even account for where Waymo is in two years from now, or what the Chinese EV industry is able to pull off until then.
Even this underwhelming event was originally announced on short notice to prop up perception when sales looked bad in April [1], delayed by two‘ish months, and then didn‘t even start on time. Oh, and implementing the robo taxi was a two-months project back then [1]. It‘s a ruse, folks.

Title: COVID-19 UK Mutual Aid groups: a list
Date: 13/03/2020
Source: https://freedomnews.org.uk/2020/03/13/covid-19-uk-mutual-aid-groups-a-list/

As the global COVID-19 pandemic is upon us, a number of mutual aid groups have started forming across the country. The groups aim at providing community support to those who are more at risk from the virus: be it help with running errands or cooking.
COVID-19 is a novel virus most affecting people’s respiratory systems. While in around 8o% cases the symptoms will be mild, it can lead to death. It is estimated that 2-3 people out of a hundred will die. This can easily mean hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone.
We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening.

 The signatories of this letter strongly condemn the actions and doctrines of the Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs)*. This strain of feminism recently gained notoriety due to their problematic opposition of the proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (these reforms proposes to allow trans and non- binary people to self- declare their gender without, as is the case now, going through humiliating legal and medical process). This law could help to make the lives of a highly discriminated against minority easier. TERFs however claim that the aim of the proposed law change is a threat to cis women.…</span>

                              <span>It would be good to be able to recognize fascism when you see it. Sight is our dominant sense (light travels faster than sound) and provides us warning. In addition, because “fascist” is an epithet as well as political term, it must be used carefully. In 1942, a New Hampshire Jehovah’s Witness named Chaplinsky was arrested after calling a Rochester city marshal a “damned fascist.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the arrest on the grounds that the expression constituted “fighting words,” excluded from constitutional protection. Recent court decisions in the U.S. have widened speech freedoms, but the word “fascist” remains highly charged, underlining the need for historical and political discretion. More

                              <span>Eu imagino que você já tentou usar o Mastodon pelo menos uma vez. Ou talvez use, longe de mim julgar. Não é de hoje que redes sociais dominadas por big techs não são exatamente os locais mais saudáveis pra ter um delicioso &quot;debate de ideias&quot;. Sempre é bom buscar alternativas.
Lembra como foi o processo? Alguém finalmente te convencia, aí então você ia lá &quot;beleza então me fala aí onde me cadastro?&quot; e você ouvia que tinha que &quot;escolher uma instância&quot;. Mesmo indo no site oficial você era direcionado a uma página com inúmeras instâncias (hoje isso mudou).
&quot;Como é amigo? O quê é uma instância?&quot; E ai começava uma considerável — ainda que interessante — explicação sobre como o Mastodon funciona, geralmente dando um certo destaque para o fato de que seu usuário agora tem o dobro de arrobas do que …</span>

                              <span>A blog post I came across recently highlighted this issue well - that virtually every conversation about blogging now revolves around audience growth and revenue generation.
theminimalists dot com, known for espousing simplicity, has a popular essay on their site recommending how to start a blog, which inevitably promotes a terrible hosting service they endorse. Video creators who talk about things like productivity also maintain SEO-first websites that aim at generating revenue rather than just sharing useful information.
While I have no personal issues with those trying to build a multimillion-dollar business out of blogging, I&#x27;m more interested in discovering independent websites that are not focused on numbers, commercialization, or sales.</span>

                              <span>For years, being grouchy was a hallmark of my personality. A combination of untreated bipolar disorder and active alcoholism gave me a perpetual frown and a repertoire of caustic comments. Thankfully, I finally sought treatment for both issues, got my life in order, and most people who know me wouldn&#x27;t describe me as ill-natured at all. I have to admit that in a lot of ways, I have it made. I work because I want to, not because I have to. My wife and kids love me. The rest of my family is self-sufficient and drama-free. I have adequate time for my hobbies.
But…
Nobody is perfect, and every once in a while, I succumb to the internal pressure to let things get to me. For some reason, things I would ordinarily overlook become sticking points. My job is helping people with technology, and I kn…</span>

EVERYFUCKINGBODY TALKS ABOUT BLOGGING ONLY IN THE TERMS OF AUDIENCE GROWTH AND MONETIZATION. It is depressing to see that blogging is treated as a mere business everywhere I look.
For me, blogging is almost like a diary (Almost, because my actual diary is a paper notebook), which additionally serves as means to express yourself to others. Not shilling shitty products, feeding your audience AI text slop, and embedding ads on every page.
We need to take blogging back to its original indie web form and meaning. Join Bear, Neocity or make your own personal website about the stuff you like.</span>

                              <span>After trying various solutions - including DeskPad - I came up with a custom cross-platform (I&#x27;m on macOS, but assume it&#x27;ll work elsewhere) solution that worked incredibly well on my 40&quot; ultrawide monitor: OBS[1].
Having never used OBS before but knowing it was popular among streamers, I wondered if I could use it to (1) only share the specific applications I wanted to share and (2) share them at a resolution that people could actually read, without constantly being asked to zoom in.
I first tried setting up a virtual camera and sharing via my video stream, but it was laggy and the quality was so poor that people couldn&#x27;t read what I was sharing. I quickly gave up on that approach.
Then I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting &quot;Windowed Projector (Preview)&quot;, it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.
Whatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.
It took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I&#x27;m very pleased with how well it works now.

                              <span>Javascript is not simple AT ALL.
It has 3 ways to declare functions, multiple variations on arrow functions syntax, a weird prototyping inheritance system, objects you can create out of &quot;new&quot; on functions, object literals that can act an pseudo-classes, classes, decorators, for-i loop + maps + filter + for-in loop (with hasOwn) + forEach, async / await + promises and an invisible but always-on event loop, objects proxies, counter-intuitive array and mapping manipulations, lots of different ways to create said arrays and mappings, very rich destructuring, so many weirdnesses on parameter handling, multiple ways to do imports that don&#x27;t work in all contexts, exports, string concatenation + string interpolation, no integer (but NaN), a &quot;strict mode&quot;, two versions of comparison operators, a dangerous &quot;with&quot; keyword, undefined vs null, generators, sparse arrays, sets...
It also has complex rules for:
- scoping (plus global variables by default and hoisting)
- &quot;this&quot; values (and manual binding)
- type coercion (destroying commutativity!)
- semi-column automatic insertion
- &quot;typeof&quot; resolution
On top of that, you execute it in various different implementations and contexts: several browser engines and nodejs at least, with or without the DOM, in or out web workers, and potentially with WASM.
There are various versions of the ECMA standard that changes the features you have access to, unless you use a transpiler. But we don&#x27;t even touch the ecosystem since it&#x27;s about the language. There would be too much to say anyway.
There are only two reasons to believe JS is simple: you know too much about it, or you don&#x27;t know enough.</span>

                              <span>As the person ultimately responsible for the Minecraft Wiki ending up in the hands of Fandom, it is great to see what Weird Gloop (and similar) are achieving. At the time of selling out, the Minecraft Wiki and Minecraft Forum cost tens of thousands of dollars per month to run and so it didn&#x27;t feel too much like selling out, because we needed money to survive[1]. 15 years later, the internet is a different place, and with the availability of Cloudflare, running high-traffic websites is much more cost effective.
If I could do things over again, on today&#x27;s internet, I like to believe Weird Gloop is the type of organisation we would have built rather than ending up inside Fandom&#x27;s machine. I guess that&#x27;s all to say: thank you Weird Gloop for achieving what we couldn&#x27;t (and sorry to all who have suffered Fandom when reading about Minecraft over the years).
[1] That&#x27;s a bit of a cop out, we did have options, the decision to sell was mostly driven by me being a dumb kid. In hindsight, we could have achieved independent sustainability, it was just far beyond what my tiny little mind could imagine.</span>

                              <span>While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries&#x27; economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.</span>

...I may be talking about recent days, but hey.
My friend&#x27;s interjection came with a wry smile. &quot;You want to be likeable?&quot;
Obviously I paused at this question. It sounded vain and shallow, but this is Asia. Results matter more than intentions, as our parents would oft prove by pointing to our tests.

Title: Observations and Comments on Kropotkin and the European War

Notes: An untitled excerpt and letter from ‘Mother Earth’, January 1915, New York City, published by Emma Goldman, edited by Alexander Berkman

 Of all the terrible features brought to light in the European War, there is one which no doubt will cause rejoicing in the camps of the various governments. It is the fact that the revolutionary movement of all shades has disclosed national and patriotic superstition and racial prejudice. 
 Before the war the Governments of Europe spent sleepless nights over the growth of Socialism, Synd…</span>

                              <span>Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the &quot;break it up&quot; camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.
As for the rebuttal of &quot;bUt ThE gDp&quot;, there&#x27;s a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&amp;A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There&#x27;s another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart&#x27;s Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.
It&#x27;s worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&amp;T and Microsoft&#x27;s own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.</span>

                              <span>My concern, and IMO what should be the overwhelming concern of the maintainers, is not the code that is being written, or the code that will be written, but all the code that has been written, and will never be touched again. A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.
For those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more &#x27;serious&#x27;, &#x27;professional&#x27; language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain&#x27;t that.</span>

                              <span>When I first heard the maxim that an intelligent person should be able to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time, I was naive to think it meant weighing them for pros and cons. Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.
Concretely related to the topic, I&#x27;ve often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I&#x27;ll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what&#x27;s going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.
My goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?</span>

ISO isn’t useful in the author’s use-case. That’s fine, it is their project to do as they will. ISOs may still have uses elsewhere, such as PXE boot or just a near universally mountable read only container.
The author’s point to the age of the original ISO standard is irrelevant. Many old technologies are reliable and widely adopted, which in and of itself may make it superior to more modern technologies.
Author’s project, author’s will. But that was difficult to read due to their attitude and beyond the author’s use case, didn’t provide a reason for universally retiring ISO.</span>

                              <span>A key question in economic policy is how labor market tightness affects wage inflation and ultimately prices. In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.</span>

The main problem with Blogs in 1997 is that it didn&#x27;t take long to realize nobody else cared about it.
The good thing about Blogs in 2024 is that you go into it knowing nobody will care about it. How Fucking Refreshing.
These days there are places to connect in 300 characters or less, places to manage &amp; moderate a growing community, and there are billionaire owned communities to help you become disappointed in your friends and family.
Sounds tedious AF.
I miss the ancient times when a simple RSS reader allowed people to lurk in the manner they preferred.
When an introvert could get a word in.
When you could fucking curse if it pleased you, because you&#x27;re an adult and sometimes things suck.
Ya know?!?
So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do here.
Curse.
But also share. With no pressure to be heard. And no pressure to respond.
If nothing else, a time capsule.
Of my journey in game development, and perhaps someday in setting up a studio. Video games have always been a wonderful escape for me. I&#x27;d call my game studio &quot;Escape Element&quot;. So that&#x27;ll be the blog&#x27;s name too.
But don&#x27;t be confused. This blog will be my personal take on things.
You could find all sorts of stuff here. It could be gamedev related stuff like art, music, or code (I dabble in all) ... or...
I may just need to rant about how stupid people are stupid.
Whatever is taking my attention at any given moment... I&#x27;m probably either in love with or pissed off at it, and it&#x27;s well past time I let the universe know about it.
If following along sounds like it may provide you with an element of escape, come on back.</span>

These changes consisted of banning four cards from the format: Dockside Extortionist, Jeweled Lotus, Mana Crypt, and Nadu, Winged Wisdom.
Less than a week later, the Commander RC – the independent group of fans who had controlled the game’s most popular format for over a decade – was no more.
What follows is an attempt at understanding how the world&#x27;s most popular card game got to this point.

&quot;You should try to write at least a little bit of music every day.&quot;
This is bad advice.
For a multitude of reasons that I won&#x27;t get into here, I&#x27;ve had a terrible few months. Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I&#x27;ve still been making music, but it&#x27;s been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can&#x27;t come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven&#x27;t had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you&#x27;ve figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.
But what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.
Starting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.
Let go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.
Begin with just one post. It doesn&#x27;t have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.
When the weekend comes, maybe you&#x27;ll sit down and create an &quot;About&quot; page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.
Step by step, you&#x27;ll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It&#x27;s your blog, you set the rules – no one else.
Soon, you&#x27;ll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.
