                              <span>Over the past week, I have enjoyed reading various Bear Blog blogs. It&#x27;s really interesting to see different viewpoints, and thoughts that are less filtered, and more raw. It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.
A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?</span>

Between armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.
Profitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.

Many accused the GOP of attempting to impose a sanitized version of America’s […]

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x &#x3D; 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is &quot;dimensionless&quot; i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

                              <span>Sitting on the balcony, listening to America by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and drinking a glass of rosé. Almost Famous comes to mind. Great film.

It&#x27;s all happening...
Thinking about lost friendships. How one minute you&#x27;re saying i love you, and the next, they&#x27;re gone, and you&#x27;re left wondering what they&#x27;re doing with their time, and wishing you could to talk to them like it was the old days.

I typically look at my private/personal journal to do these weekly recaps but this week has been not so great that I didn’t have the energy to do much introspective writing.
Something happened at work this week that broke my heart and grateful at the same time. It’s such a contradictory feeling that has left me feeling torn and emotionally exhausted. It is continuing to happen and I’m just hoping I have the energy to endure all of it in the coming days.
I have a lot of things upcoming that I am absolutely dreading, but don’t have the power to change or control. For now, I am trying my best to put it aside and consider it a tomorrow/next week/next month problem. It’s causing me unnecessary stress, but I don’t know what else to do.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t written much on my blog in the last few weeks...
I&#x27;ve started some blog posts here and there but haven&#x27;t finished them. Or I simply didn&#x27;t publish them for various reasons.
Instead, I created a few slash pages, experimented with my site design, jotted down a few new ideas, read plenty of blog posts from the discovery feed and emailed with some wonderful Bear Blog bloggers.
And I had a lot of fun doing these things...
At first, it felt weird not to finish and publish any blog posts. It also caused me some anxiety. But blogging should be fun...
For me, Bear Blog is fun.
So instead of thinking too much about writing…
I enjoyed experimenting, reading and socializing on Bear Blog.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m old enough to remember when people of faith could justify their affiliation with the Republican Party. That party as it exists today is far removed from the Christianity I was raised around. Lately for some reason, I&#x27;ve just felt like pointing that out every chance I get. I think I have just reached my lifetime limit of hateful hypocrisy. I know plenty of good, believing Christians who do not subscribe to the lie that you can follow Jesus and Donald Trump at the same time. My only sister is an ordained Methodist minister at a church in Raleigh and she isn&#x27;t preaching from her pulpit the kind of anti-LGBT, pro-gun, tax-cutting, pro-death penalty lunacy that conservative MAGA churches are so proud of.

                              <span>Like many people, my view of birdwatching (&quot;birding&quot;) and its practitioners were neutral at best, holding their stereotypical focal gear, donning vests and hats.
I learned that my friend casually did it on his walks and stuff, and was able to identify birds. That was cool, and made the hobby a bit more approachable for me.
It wasn&#x27;t until COVID when I saw a pair of cute yellow birds in the tree. Because the leaves haven&#x27;t grown in yet, I was able to watch them fly around the tree, landing in different spots, and ultimately move on to other spots. I was so mesmerized, I thought I had just seen a legendary pokemon. I immediately went to google, and found that it was an American Goldfinch.
It wasn&#x27;t really easy to find though. Google took me down an old-web looking site with the title &quot;Birds …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling rather listless about coding recently. I briefly tried some things on a sideproject website of mine to get back into it, and it was like pulling teeth. I haven&#x27;t properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there&#x27;s more to it.
I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn&#x27;t gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I&#x27;m so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

                              <span>I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I&#x27;d make my own version of it
Here&#x27;s my anti-resume,
I don&#x27;t specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don&#x27;t follow clean code, I don&#x27;t follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don&#x27;t like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I do a lot of recreational coding. I don&#x27;t care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it&#x27;s beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don&#x27;t like using iterators over loops, I don&#x27;t do operator overloading, I don&#x27;t like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I&#x27;m starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don&#x27;t like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don&#x27;t like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I&#x27;m not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That&#x27;s it for now :)</span>

                              <span>On my history with sports betting.
Disclaimer: I am not a fan of gambling. I do not condone it. I do not recommend it. In fact, I believe online gambling and sports betting will irrevocably damage entire generations. I was terribly addicted and it really gave me bad thoughts all the time. Do not, do not gamble.
With that being said, I used to gamble, a lot. I started really young: when I was 11. It began innocuously with Team Fortress 2, betting in-game currencies like refined metals in raffle groups for larger prizes. I was on the edge of my seat for pennies. I never told my parents (hint: my family was poor). While this wasn&#x27;t particularly profitable, it was my introduction to the habit. Trading virtual items in Team Fortress 2 was more lucrative and in fact how I made most of my early s…</span>

Dans mon article précédent, j’ai constaté un malaise :
de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle m’ont déçu.
Je suis parti en envolées lyriques.
Maintenant, j’ai envie d’agir.
J’ai déjà commencé, en réalité,
depuis plusieurs semaines.
J’expérimente des trucs.
J’en ré-applique d’autres que j’avais laissés de côté.
Dans mes prochains articles,
je vais probablement me concentrer à nouveau
sur du plus &quot;jeu de rôle&quot;.
Mais j&#x27;ai l&#x27;intuition que parler de créativité en général,
ça apporte aussi quelque chose.
Me contenter de parler &quot;techniques de jeu de rôle&quot;,
c&#x27;est comme brûler une étape.
Donc... Je vais encore parler de moi.
(Et peut-être de toi)
On nous a tendu un piège

de créativité, et de neurobullshi…</span>

That’s kind of insane to me, I was pretty sure no one was going to read this thing, and I’m still not 100% sure why people do. I’m just some person!! I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!
Also, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.</span>
