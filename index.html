                              <span>Well, that statement lays out a damning timeline:
- OpenAI approached Scarlett last fall, and she refused.
- Two days before the GPT-4o launch, they contacted her agent and asked that she reconsider. (Two days! This means they already had everything they needed to ship  the product with Scarlett’s  cloned voice.)
- Not receiving a response, OpenAI demos the product anyway, with Sam tweeting “her” in reference to Scarlett’s film.
- When Scarlett’s counsel asked for an explanation of how the “Sky” voice was created, OpenAI yanked the voice from their product line.
Perhaps Sam’s next tweet should read “red-handed”.</span>

Make sure that your comment is following them, and that you are posting in the intended spirit: intellectually curious, respectful conversation.
&quot;Respectful&quot; here means respectful to the people who are wrong (in your view) and most respectful to the people who are most wrong (in your view). If you can&#x27;t do that, that&#x27;s ok, but please don&#x27;t post until you can. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive - https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.
Hellish flamewars in deep subthreads are not ok. I&#x27;m going to lower the bar for banning accounts that do this, so please don&#x27;t do this. If you&#x27;re hotly indignant, step away from the keyboard until that changes. Nobody &#x27;wins&#x27; on the internet anyway, and it&#x27;s not worth destroying this community for.

                              <span>Their &quot;copilot&quot; brand is so weird and... muddled.
There&#x27;s the AI code assistant thing that github actually started, there&#x27;s the horrible chatbot maker GUI demoware, there&#x27;s AI stuff you might be able to do with your sharepoint (if only you could get hold of the right ms sales rep to take your money), there&#x27;s an app that does genai things on your personal MS account... And now there&#x27;s a Surface rebrand?
That org chart meme about Microsoft being little fiefdoms pointing guns at eachother never stops being relevant.

                              <span>Supply chain disruptions became a major headache for businesses in the aftermath of the pandemic. Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.</span>

                              <span>Since as early as Kubernetes v1.7, the Kubernetes project has pursued the ambitious goal of removing built-in cloud provider integrations (KEP-2395).
While these integrations were instrumental in Kubernetes&#x27; early development and growth, their removal was driven by two key factors:
the growing complexity of maintaining native support for every cloud provider across millions of lines of Go code, and the desire to establish
Kubernetes as a truly vendor-neutral platform.
After many releases, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce that all cloud provider integrations have been successfully migrated from the core Kubernetes repository to external plugins.
In addition to achieving our initial objectives, we&#x27;ve also significantly streamlined Kubernetes by removing roughly 1.5 million lines of code and reduci…</span>

                              <span>If you like this, it&#x27;s also worth looking at llama2.c[1], an implementation of the Llama 2 architecture in about 1000 lines of plain, dependency-free C, tokenizer and all. THe fact that this 960-line file and a somewhat modern C compiler is all you really need to run a state-of-the-art language model is really surprising to many.
Of course, this is not all there is to a modern LLM, it would probably take another thousand lines or two to implement training, and many more than that to make it fast on all the major CPU and GPU architectures. If you want a flexible framework that lets a developer define any model you want and still goes as fast as it can, the complexity spirals.
Most programmers have an intuition that duplicating a large software project from scratch, like Linux or Chromium for example, would require incredible amounts of expertise, manpower and time. It&#x27;s not something that a small team can achieve in a few months. You&#x27;re limited by talent, not hardware.
LLMs are very different. THe code isn&#x27;t that complicated, you could probably implement training and inference for a single model architecture, from scratch, on a single kind of GPU, with reasonable performance, as an individual with a background in programming and who still remembers their calculus and linear algebra, with a year or so of self study. What makes LLMs difficult is getting access to all the hardware to train them, getting the data, and being able to preprocess that data.</span>

The biggest cost is as you imagine the streaming - getting the video to the viewer.  It was a large part of our variable cost and we had a (literal) mad genius dev ops person holed up in his own office cave that managed the whole operation.
Ive long forgotten the special optimizations he did but he would keep finding ways to improve margin / efficiency.
Encoding is a cost but I don’t recall it being significant
Storage isnt generally expensive. Think about how cheap you as a consumer can go get 2 TB of storage, and extrapolate.
The other big expense - people!  All those engineers to build back and front end systems. That’s what ruined us - too many people were needed and not enough money coming in so we were burning cash.</span>

If you&#x27;ve played the game you might remember the one spot where there&#x27;s a giant sword sticking out of the ground. Since this place also appears in one of the game&#x27;s FMV cutscenes they had to use a real giant sword prop for filming. The person that made the giant sword prop was Adam Savage from Mythbusters.

Here we go.
Hi, I&#x27;m Meï ! And welcome to this blog. Or this attempt at a blog.
It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil&#x27; kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.
A friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.
I used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.
As of late, I&#x27;ve been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I&#x27;ve been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn&#x27;t really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.
This built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.
So once again, here we go!
1. As a note, the &quot;Fucktopia&quot; is a reference to Souillon&#x27;s comic book &quot;Hello Fucktopia&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t find a listing in English, sorry! It&#x27;s available in French &amp; Spanish, at least..
My small rules of writing
Try to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.
Focus! I&#x27;m super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.
No stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let&#x27;s keep this place as my comfy Internet place.
Let&#x27;s hope it goes well. And I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this blog and its topics.

When I was a young child, I would sometimes stay a weekend in the summer holidays with my cousins – who were of a similar age – on their farm.   I grew up in north London: all concrete and cars, and fumes and arcades, and long black railings and grey school playgrounds, and rising tower blocks and rushing roads.   Looking back, the farm of my uncle and aunt couldn’t have been more than a thirty- or forty-minute drive from where I lived in the city; the farm itself was situated only a few fields away from the motorway you would need to traverse to get there. Hardly the back and beyond.

I am beyond tired of writing and reading about Trump, his minions Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon, and the evils they plan to inflict upon the world. Reading or watching the news is a daily exercise in dread, self-torment, and exhaustion. The return of spring notwithstanding, things are grim these days. The Trumpist menace seems of a piece with a far-right axis on the march in India, Russia, Israel, China, and Hungary. Of course, it’s futile to wring one’s hands and lament Trumpian aspirations to authoritarianism without taking concrete action to prevent them. Yet despite nearly eight years of experience confronting the Trumpian specter, the answer to the traditional, eminently practical leftist question “What is to be done?” remains elusive, and the sense of burnout and political defeat—with the concomitant, complicated welter of emotions —is a specter difficult to vanquish.

                              <span>We did night CTF (~9 pm) at our local grade school campus. Easily 40-50 kids. We just rode our bikes to the gathering. Similar rules to what this article had, except no out of bounds. We had kids making huge circuits around a nearby corn field to evade detection.
It was indeed someone of my best childhood memories.
Unfortunately it was all brought to an end because people kept calling the cops. They’d see kids after dark at the school and just assume we were up to no good. No property was ever damaged, the principal knew what we were up to, etc. Wholesome fun.
After the fifth time of coming home with a “the cops showed up” story, our well-meaning parents asked us to please find another game to play.</span>

                              <span>I cannot agree more with the author’s point of view. As an illustration, many people want to use GPS for the safe positioning of trains in the European Train Control Systems. This makes the space sector happy because it justifies the expenditures incurred for putting things like Galileo in orbit. However, in a pre-war check exercise, one immediately come to the conclusion that all European trains would crawl to a stop in case the GPS is jammed or interfered with. We were not very listened to… until Ukraine.
Critical infrastructures should not depend from things that are located in space or on the other side of the planet. These are one of those things were market logic should be anticipated with regulations (we can’t wait for the next Titanic). Another point touched by the article.</span>

                              <span>The best approach to circumventing the nondisclosure agreement is for the affected employees to get together, write out everything they want to say about OpenAI, train an LLM on that text, and then release it.
Based on these companies&#x27; arguments that copyrighted material is not actually reproduced by these models, and that any seemingly-infringing use is the responsibility of the user of the model rather than those who produced it, anyone could freely generate an infinite number of high-truthiness OpenAI anecdotes, freshly laundered by the inference engine, that couldn&#x27;t be used against the original authors without OpenAI invalidating their own legal stance with respect to their own models.</span>

                              <span>Ilan Pappé is 70 years old. He’s Jewish. His parents fled persecution in Hitler’s Germany. He’s an Israeli and served in the IDF. He hasn’t been radicalized by TikTok. He is, in fact, one of Israel’s most celebrated historians. None of that stopped Pappé from being detained by Biden’s TSA in Detroit, interrogated by the agents from the Department of Homeland Security about whether he’s a supporter of Hamas, and having his phone data copied. This crackdown isn’t about protecting Jews or  Israelis or preserving the exceptional nature of the Holocaust.

Forcing employees to sign a perpetual non-disparagement agreement under threat of clawing back the large majority of their already earned compensation should not be legal. Honestly it probably isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;ll take someone brave enough to sue to find out.</span>

                              <span>It probably would be better to switch the link from the X post to the Vox article [0].
From the article:
“““
It turns out there’s a very clear reason for [why no one who had once worked at OpenAI was talking]. I have seen the extremely restrictive off-boarding agreement that contains nondisclosure and non-disparagement provisions former OpenAI employees are subject to. It forbids them, for the rest of their lives, from criticizing their former employer. Even acknowledging that the NDA exists is a violation of it.
If a departing employee declines to sign the document, or if they violate it, they can lose all vested equity they earned during their time at the company, which is likely worth millions of dollars. One former employee, Daniel Kokotajlo, who posted that he quit OpenAI “due to losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI,” has confirmed publicly that he had to surrender what would have likely turned out to be a huge sum of money in order to quit without signing the document.

                              <span>Has it really been 9 years since I started working on Ubershaders?
I&#x27;m a little surprised no better solution has come along. Vulkan didn&#x27;t even exist back then (and DirectX 12 had only just released) but instead of making things better, it digs it&#x27;s feet even deeper into the assumption that all shaders will be known ahead of time (resulting in long &quot;shader recompilation&quot; dialogs on startup on many games).
I&#x27;ve been tempted to build my own fast shader compiler into Dolphin for many common GPU architectures. Hell, it wouldn&#x27;t even be a proper compiler, more of a templated emitter as all shaders fit a pattern. Register allocation and scheduling could all be pre-calculated.
But that would be even more insane than ubershaders, as it would be one backend per gpu arch. And some drivers (like Nvidia) don&#x27;t provide a way to inject pre-compiled shader binaries.
On the positive side, ubershaders do solve the problem, and modern GPU drivers do a much better job at accepting ubershaders than they did 9 years ago. Though that&#x27;s primarily because (as far as I&#x27;m aware) examples of Dolphin&#x27;s ubershader have made their way into every single shader compiler test suite.</span>

                              <span>I run one of the largest email sending services on the internet. I have been living the “mess” of internet email for over 20 years.
Here’s the thing: despite the internet’s email system being complex and confusing and riddled with problems, it is universally adopted and interoperable. No other open communication tool can boast of email’s massive interoperability.
Any new system will face the impossible burden of winning hearts and minds while the old system continues to chug along with billions of annual R&amp;D spending and dozens of conferences full of smart people working on solving problems.
Even if “MX2” can peacefully coexist in the DNS, why would anyone spend the millions of dollars in engineering effort to move while their teams are busy building the latest layer that’s been invented to patch over the current system?
By all means if you want to propose a new email system, show up at IETF or M3AAWG and make a bold proposal. Someone will buy you a beer while they explain why you are much better off getting into the mud pit with the rest of us and working on the next pragmatic fix to keep things rolling along.</span>

                              <span>I love this. I read so much criticism here, but noise pollution is a main issue when it comes to railroads in residential zones.
Yes, punctuality is an issue with Deutsche Bahn. No, this doesn’t fix that instantly. But as an organisation you can work on two things at the same time.
This invention is spectacular. I wish more people would work on noise pollution. It makes a huge difference.</span>

                              <span>This algorithm seems to resemble HyperLogLog (and all its variants), which is also cited in the research paper. Using the same insight of the estimation value of tracking whether we&#x27;ve hit a &quot;run&quot; of heads or tails, but flipping the idea on its head (heh), it leads to the simpler algorithm described, which is about discarding memorized values on the basis of runs of heads/tails.
This also works especially well (that is, efficiently) in the streaming case, allowing you to keep something resembling a &quot;counter&quot; for the distinct elements, albeit with a error rate.
The benefit of HyperLogLog is that it behaves similarly to a hash set in some respects -- you can add items, count distinct them, and, importantly, merge two HLLs together (union), all the while keeping memory fixed to mere kilobytes even for billion-item sets. In distributed data stores, this is the trick behind Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cardinality agg, as well as behind Redis/Redict with its PFADD/PFMERGE/PFCOUNT.
I am not exactly sure how this CVM algorithm compares to HLL, but they got Knuth to review it, and they claim an undergrad can implement it easily, so it must be pretty good!</span>

I recall posting the links to these on my twitter and tumblr raving about how good and eye-opening they are, recommending them to my friends and mutuals, and soon thereafter reading their thoughts about the essays too. video essays became a sort of internet cultural phenomenon around this time, spurred on by those very videos, the former now holding 11 million views and the former with just a bit under 6 million. but what is so captivating about these videos? what about a video can make millions not only tune in for the first time…</span>

skipping openings just because you&#x27;re on a binge can so easily rob you of what i&#x27;d argue are the best narrative and collective highs a series can offer.1
from a purely functional standpoint, they give us time to breathe and process what exactly we&#x27;re watching. take, for example, the three versions of shippuden&#x27;s penultimate opening— blood circulator. each variant denotes which point of the story you&#x27;re at, and primes you for what&#x27;s to come. (if you pay attention, you&#x27;ll notice they lead into each other seamlessly! so neat.)

he had chronic heart failure. we were counting down the months, really, but nothing could’ve ever prepared me for that 3am knock, his fading heartbeat, and his little eyes that wouldn’t close.

Dear Gabby,
It’s not just you: getting over the fear of expectations is hard. I still struggle with it, after 300 something posts. I have a feeling I’ll never get completely over it, but here’s what’s helped me so far.
Posting a lot helps. I’ve posted so much nonsense on this blog that these days there’s not much I can do that will be worse than something I’ve written before. Somehow, I still have regular readers. Realizing that there are people out there still interested in what I have to say after all the good and not so good is a great comfort. From what you write, you seem to have discovered as much.
Another perk of having a large body of work is that each new piece you create becomes a smaller and smaller part of your entire oeuvre. When you’re first starting out, it feels like each creation you put out defines you. After all, if you only have one post, it’s the only thing people can judge you on. If you have a hundred, a wayward post is a drop in the bucket.
That said, wouldn’t you still want to see the creations your friends or favorite creators aren’t proud of? Or see their art even if it doesn’t quite fit the niche they’ve carved out for themselves? Everybody half-asses things in their own unique way. There’s a beauty in doing things imperfectly, too.
All that is to say, keep up what you’re doing. Creative inertia is a very real thing. You’re doing the right thing by posting, even if you feel like you’re just posting to break the streak of inactivity. Writing in any form begets more writing.
Anyway, welcome back to Bear! It’s good to have you back.
Yours,

 Today opposition is anarchist or it is non-existent. This is the barest minimum coherence in the struggle against an engulfing totality. 
 And while ten years ago the milieu generally called anti-authoritarian was largely syndicalist, those leftist residues are fading out altogether. Very few now find a vista of work and production at all liberatory. 
 As the smell of this false and rotting order rises to the heavens, registering an unprecedented toll on all living beings, faith in the whole modern world evaporates. Industrialism and its ensemble looks like it has been a very bad idea, sort of a wrong turn begun still earlier. Civilization itself, with its logic of domestication and…</span>

                              <span>For many people, the question is inflammatory. The crimes of the German Nazis were of such magnitude that comparison with any other historical violence is invidious. The genocide of the Jews was deliberate and methodical and intended to eliminate every last one. The goal was the same with the Romani and Sinti people. By comparison, the Israelis – currently accused of genocide -- are rank amateurs. They have so far killed some 35,000 Palestinians in Gaza out of a population of 2.3 million. More

Two of the shipments used an emergency authority to circumvent Congressional review. The surge of weapons transfers to Israel began in early October and so much material was being shipped that the Pentagon had a difficult time finding enough cargo aircraft to deliver them. More

                              <span>“Do you think ‘sit-ins’ at lunch counters, ‘Freedom Buses’ and other demonstrations by Negroes will hurt or help the Negro&#x27;s chances of being integrated in the South?” This question was posed by Gallup, a leading polling organization, back in 1961, during the heyday of the Civil Rights Movement. A majority of Americans at the time, 57%, believed that the sit-ins would “hurt” the movement. They were wrong. Today, we credit the Civil Rights Movement with ending racial segregation in the United States, but we cannot disconnect its success from its tactics. Martin Luther King Jr. was no advocate of passive resistance, but a firm believer in “militant nonviolence”– a consistent torrent of protests in the form of boycotts, mass marches, sit-ins, and strikes. These are similar tactics to those that students across the world are using to spread awareness of the over 30,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza and to push their universities to dissociate from the Israeli State.

                              <span>I worked at deviantArt from 2009 to 2013. It was my dream job. At the time deviantArt made money a few ways.
In no particular order, because I don&#x27;t know which were profitable or which represented a larger portion of revenue:
- Subscriptions (users could pay for a few extra features and to disable ads on the site)
- DeviantArt branded merch.
- Prints and products with users&#x27; art printed on them
- Sponsored Contests. These promoted movies or other media properties, or software of interest to artists. Often the prizes included Wacom tablets and Adobe Photoshop licenses.
During my time there a significant problem we were dealing with was due to deviantArt&#x27;s stance on adult content. Anything was allowed as long as it wasn&#x27;t outright pornography.  In practice that meant that nudes were allowed but sexual acts were not. This had consequences for deviantArt&#x27;s revenue. It meant that we could not run ads from the &quot;reputable&quot; ad networks and were forced to deal with seedier outfits that often (e.g. constantly) included malware in the display ads, exposing users to all sorts of nasty stuff. One of my projects was to detect and/or prevent the malware ads which proved challenging and at least given the amount of resources devoted to it, it was not very fruitful.
It really is sad for me to see what deviantArt has devolved into. Once the original founders sold out a few years ago I really didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the site&#x27;s future.</span>

                              <span>&gt; And that typed text is way, way cleaner than any typewriter I’ve seen.
Pedantic point: electric typewriters (which have existed since the 1960s) do type in a way that looks exactly like this.
(In fact, note that the text on the real employee ID card, shown later in the article, doesn&#x27;t look any less clean! It&#x27;s just set in a different, narrower font.)
The smudginess of mechanical typewriters comes from 1. them striking (and especially, releasing) at the same speed you&#x27;re depressing the key, and 2. having many of the keys necessarily approach the ribbon from an angle.
The keys being swung weakly by your fingers, also has the additional implication that the ink ribbons used in mechanical typewriters have to be soft and squishy (so: made of cloth), and use thin inks. These properties ensure a transfer from even a low-velocity impact. But the trade-off is that cloth ink ribbons transfer only a rough outline of what&#x27;s struck; and thin inks are high-bleed inks.
An electric typewriter, playing out a pre-buffered line with a crisp, predictable report, using linear actuators and a rotating-ball type-head to bang a tape ribbon loaded with high-viscosity ink onto the page, can create text indistinguishable from books/newspapers of the same period, or from modern laser-printer reproductions of the same font faces. They&#x27;re essentially character-at-a-time letterpresses!
(Also, ignoring electric typewriters for a sec: inks bleed more on thin, cheap paper. But this is [a forgery of] an employee ID card — where, for durability, a nice heavyweight paper or cardstock would have been used. You&#x27;re always going to get a better-looking result inking such paper.)</span>

This feels so full of subtle qualifiers and weasel words that it generates far more distrust than trust.
It only refers to models used &quot;broadly across all&quot; customers - so if it&#x27;s (a) not used &quot;broadly&quot; or (b) only used for some subset of customers, the whole statement doesn&#x27;t apply.

                              <span>So much of the DeviantArt story reads like Tumblr. Two platforms appealing to amateur and small artists grow to great relevance among a patchwork of subcultures. Then, they start trying to turn a profit and end up alienating the entire userbase that carried them to that point. DeviantArt is much further down that road than Tumblr is, though. It&#x27;s sad to see. Both platforms were key to the WWW of my childhood.

                              <span>I think one of the biggest reasons why I was utterly pissed off at the dude for ditching me was all of that  built-up anticipation, only to be disappointed at the very end. I had this really big expectation, but I think I really shouldn&#x27;t count on people too much. In my mind, I hadn&#x27;t had a little trip in a while, and having that cool rendezvous experience with a cute guy? I was so keen.
I can&#x27;t believe that I made plans with someone, looked forward to our weekend getaway, only to find out he&#x27;s changed his plans without a word and flew off somewhere instead. It completely left me feeling confused and downright pissed off. I didn&#x27;t think I deserved to be left hanging like that and to not have an in-person apology. I haven&#x27;t even seen him ever since we went to the museum together 1 2.

a little bit after my last post, i went on some back-to-back trips around asia. i spent a few days in seoul and about a week in bali. i did actually write about both of those trips with the intention of sharing them with all of you on here but for some reason i couldn&#x27;t quite bring myself to publish it. i&#x27;ve never really written on any sort of platform before this, but i&#x27;m assuming that just like visual art, some writing is just meant to be kept to yourself.
with the only things i had written in that span of 4 weeks being private, i didn&#x27;t really have much else to post. and the longer i went without posting, the harder it was to come back. this always happens to me. it was the exact same mindset i had with my art account o…</span>

                              <span>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rose almost simultaneously in most economies around the world. After peaking in mid-2022, inflation then went into decline—a fall that was just as universal as the initial rise. In this post, we explore the interrelation of inflation dynamics across OECD countries by constructing a measure of the persistence of global inflation. We then study the extent to which the persistence of global inflation reflects broad-based swings, as opposed to idiosyncratic country-level movements. Our main finding is that the spike and subsequent moderation in global inflation in the post-pandemic period were driven by persistent movements. When we look at measures of inflation that include food and energy prices, most of the persistence appears to be broad-based, suggesting that international oil and commodity prices played an important role in global inflation dynamics. Excluding food and energy prices in the analysis still shows a broad-based persistence, although with a substantial increase in the role of country-specific factors.</span>

 Thomas Paine is one of the most maligned and least understood of men. One of the noblest minded of men in most respects, he has been represented for nearly a century as a groveling nature and a monster of iniquity. Supremely generous in all his public career, he is said to have been mean and self-seeking. Having refused to profit by the copyright of his religious and political works, he is called parsimonious.

 Good people who hold opinions not commonly understood generally have a bad name. The world is ready to believe almost anything of a man except that he is a genuinely good man. If his life is stainless but unconventional, the world suspects some hidden shame or base motive. So far are most people from understanding or desiring what is true and right that the highest truth is often believed to be the lowest lie, and the purest right is looked upon as the blackest wrong.

 Because he changed into so many different suits during his long career, historians have not focused on the dashing radical orator Hugh O. Pentecost. 
 Born September 30, 1848 at New Harmony, Indiana, Pentecost was given his middle name for Robert Owen, whose followers had established the town as a Fourierist colony a generation earlier. His parents, Emma Flower and Hugh Lockett Pentecost, were of English descent, with many Protestant clergy in their family tree. Hugh moved at age two to Albion, Illinois, which was founded by his grandfather, Scarborough Pentecost, Jr.

whispered in forums or seen etched into the digital walls of open source communities.
But what depth of truth lies within this ancient wisdom, especially in the vast,
evolving world of Kubernetes?
Today, contributing to open source extends far beyond the realm of coding.
It&#x27;s an inclusive journey that welcomes the diverse skills of all who wish
to be a part of it. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned developer or someone whose strengths
lie outside traditional programming, your contributions hold immense value.
Imagine yourself embarking on a journey that leverages your expertise and love
for free software to enhance your capabilities and strengthen the very foundation
of the Kubernetes ecosystem. This is a real opportunity …</span>

Title: How to find Your Local Wobbly History
Date: 2000
Notes: Published in Anarcho-Syndicalist Review #28, Spring 2000.

 One can find the forgotten Wobbly names and faces, strike stories, union halls and martyrs’ graves in any city where the IWW earned its legendary reputation. It is easy to find thorough information on the luminaries, such as Tresca, Flynn and Giovanitti, but what about those local organizers who invited these major figures to town, and then kept working after they were gone, pouring the wine of rebellion into workers’ hearts? It may take some time, but in all probability you’ll find syndicalist monuments and hallowed ground that you walk past every day, but never knew existed.

Title: ​Doctors and Druggists Among the Early Philadelphia Anarchists
Date: September 2006
Notes: An earlier, much shorter version of this article, “Anarchists in Medicine and Pharmacy: Philadelphia, 1889–1930,” appeared in Clamor Magazine #6 (Dec. 2000/Jan. 2001), and had previously been posted on both the Guinea Pig Zero and Dead Anarchists websites.

 In the City of Philadelphia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a large group of professionals who practiced medicine or pharmacy as a livelihood, while committing great energies to the anarchist movement. Looking past the surface, we find a closely knit community of intellectuals who treated their comrades as patients, educated the publ…</span>

​Introduction
 Voltairine de Cleyre, by far Philadelphia’s brightest anarchist light, was 30 years old when, during the late summer or fall of 1897, she wrote the following letter in London. The letter was never finished, nor was it signed, dated, or mailed. Yet the letter, clearly in her handwriting and style, came to rest in a large group of her letters in the papers of Joseph J. Cohen (1878–1953), de Cleyre’s longtime associate in anarchism, which are stored in the Bund Collection, YIVO Archives, in New York City. It is one of the most compellin…</span>

Title: All Eyes on Rafah
Date: May 15th, 2024
Notes: The following article is a transcript of a speech given by Geelong Anarchist Communists member Tommy Lawson at an Independent and Peaceful Australia Network (IPAN) ‘Rally for Rafah’ held on Saturday 11th of May. Its content is supported unanimously by Geelong Anarchist Communists. We have decided to publish it today, on the 76th anniversary of the Nakba (‘catastrophe’) to declare that we stand with those resisting genocide and colonisation.

                              <span>A central feature of neo-liberal capitalism, which has ruled the global economy since the 1990s, is to deepen and widen inequalities. It makes a tiny minority indecently richer while leaving the majority in the lurch. Women and minorities such as indigenous peoples, LGBTQIA+ or racialized people are badly hit by those inequalities. In a situation in which famine and extreme poverty keep increasing, the withdrawal of the State further feeds the vicious circle of poverty and inequality. (...)

                              <span>For the longest time, I wanted to work in big tech. I got placed in one such company from campus placements. It was mostly due to my c programming skills and research work.
I am grateful for the role. I get to work on something I like. The people I work with are smart and kind. But it is just a job. Both to me and to the people I work with. One of the major perks that the HR department keeps repeating is a great work-life balance. You get time for yourself. That is very true.
Isn&#x27;t that great? You get paid well. Get enough time for a good social life and side projects. You can also fund these side projects with your salary.
Yes, but what about working in a startup? A place where a lot of super passionate people are going ham at what they do. To them, it is not a job but a mission. A sort of crazy cult. Filled with kind passionate nerds. Some place where you own part of the dream. Have equity.
It sounds nice. But such places are very rare. The startup scene in India is pretty horrible. I have heard some really bad stories. So many of the startups look cool on the outside. Have great pay even. But are horrible to work for. I have had friends experience this.
I also feel like I am not good enough for those truly cracked places yet. So I am happy where I am for now and just Skill maxxing. I want to feel like a really capable engineer. I see so many of them at my org. All are really kind and happy to guide me.
Sometimes these essays help me put my life in context and clear my thinking a lot. This was one of those.</span>

Abstract
 In this paper, we aim to analyze the processes of stigmatization and pathologization to which certain categories of body inscriptions have been subjected throughout the history of modern Western society. Body inscriptions are defined as any and all modifications made to the body&#x27;s structure. While some inscriptions are exalted and praised, others are stigmatized and discriminated aga…</span>

 The question of how for Anarchist Communism agrees exactly with State Socialism, and the exact line that divides them, has long seemed to me one that it would be well to enter into. And just now, in view of the approaching International Congress, seems a time particularly appropriate for this consideration. For surely…</span>

Notes: Routledge Studies in Radical History and Politics
Source: 

Colin Ward and the Art of Everyday Anarchy is the first full account of Ward’s life and work. Drawing on unseen archival sources, as well as oral interviews, it excavates the worlds and words of his anarchist thought, illuminating his methods and charting the legacies of his enduring influence. 
 Colin Ward (1924—2010) was the most prominent British writer on anarchism in the 20th century. As a radical journalist, later author, he applied his distinctive anarchist principles to all aspects of community life including the built environment, education, and public policy. His thought was subtle, universal in a…</span>

Title: And Yet It Moves (Updated Edition)
Subtitle: The Realization and Suppression of Science and Technology
Date: 1985
Notes: A situationist critique of science and technology published in New York in 1985. This version is a new edition that was published on the &#x27;Endangered Phoenix&#x27; website and credited to Phil Meyler. The Endangered Phoenix website is dead now, and I can’t find the updated version on the website through the wayback machine, so there are some footnotes and chapter heading levels which are unclear to me. Plus, I think chapter 3 &amp; 4 were merged in the updated edition, so chapter numbers went out of sync, but chapter 8 was still called chapter 8 which makes it seem like chapter 7 is missing on the libcom website. It is all very confusing, but …</span>

 In Freedom Anarchist Journal’s Winter 2023-2024 issue, Matthew Azoulay submitted an article introducing readers to Murray Bookchin’s ideas of the communalist assembly[1] which disturbed and surprised me for how much it was outdated.

The Political Capability of the Chinese People
 There are some who doubt that the Chinese people are capable of creating a truly democratic state. We emphatically disagree. The political environment in any country is created by its leaders. The perceptions and habits of the people can be changed to follow those of the leadership. Furthermore, Chinese society has been traditionally rich in self-governing organizations, which can be effectively used to reconstruct [China as] a democratic state.

 A characteristic of our time is that much is accomplished in spirit but little is accomplished in reality. Perhaps even the lack of actual implementation corresponds to a special activity of the mind, which constantly strives to overcome its own formations without leaving the form of fantasy and doctrine.

 “The beginning of every revolution is an exit, an exit from the social order that power has enshrined in the name of law, stability, public interest, and the greater good.” 
 - Basel al-Araj 
 With the Aurora Borealis above us and the martyrs in our hearts, we attacked the UC Office of the President in solidarity with the Palestinian Resistance. Using a fire extinguisher filled with red paint we covered the facade and smashed seven windows. Then, with access to the building, we released 500 cockroaches inside and emptied a second fire exintguisher onto the interior. We finalized…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s 2 genders, right? We all know that.
Of course there is. You&#x27;re either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you&#x27;re a woman without said dangly bits.
But maybe there&#x27;s more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn&#x27;t feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it&#x27;s the opposite? Or something in between?
Honestly, I don&#x27;t give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I&#x27;ll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.
Look, it&#x27;s a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We&#x27;ve been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there&#x27;s been 2 genders. Male and female.
But in the last few decades there&#x27;s been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as &quot;him&quot; don&#x27;t get up on your high horse and start screaming &quot;YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!&quot;
I assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that&#x27;s fine. Tell me politely and I&#x27;ll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.
Irony is, if you&#x27;re not a dick about the whole thing, you&#x27;re far more likely to get people on-side. You&#x27;re always gonna get bigoted wankers, that&#x27;s par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn&#x27;t make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.
It just makes them human.
Peace ✌🏻

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing this post as a break from working on the comic I have due at the end of the month. It&#x27;s an eighteen-page oneshot and my very first contribution to an anthology, which is honestly very exciting. Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.
Working on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don&#x27;t like inking, I half-ass shapes I don&#x27;t understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don&#x27;t really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing. Stuff is getting done!

                              <span>My throat hurts a little. I don’t know if this is because of the air quality here or because I’m actually getting sick, but I’m desperately hoping it’s not the latter. I stopped taking my immunosuppressants today and started drinking lots of juices high in vitamin C, despite research proving chugging OJ a rather ineffective method for warding off illness. (Something about all the sugar in it makes it hard for your body to absorb the Vitamin C, if I remember correctly.)
Traveling and getting sick go hand in hand for me. It’s as if arriving somewhere new triggers my immune system to self-immolate. When I visited New York in 2021 I lost my voice after a few days. I spent my first week in Latin America making chicken noodle soup and nursing myself back to health. My immune system’s never been …</span>
