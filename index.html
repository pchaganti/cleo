                              <span>Lifepo4 (lithium iron phosphate) batteries for the home are pretty cheap as of today. Power storage for residential use in a 48v metal rackable linkable system with battery management system (BMS) is $89/kwh shipped/duty paid from reputable chinese suppliers CATL/Seplos etc. You have to wait for sea shipping, add $30/kwh if you want to buy it in the US today.
From the same suppliers sodium batteries are currently $130/kwh and about 26% less efficient in the same form factor. I look forward to this changing.
Due to rising power costs I moved one of my homes completely to solar and battery (lifepo4) and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to the power company. Panels have gotten to the point of being ridiculously cheap. I have a lot of space. I purchased pallets of used panels for more or less the cost of transportation ($34 per panel 270w). They produce about 85% of their nominal rating.
I mention this because other comments mention costs that are much much higher.</span>

PowerShell faced extreme opposition at Microsoft, and its creator Jeffrey Snover was demoted for pursuing it.
Jeffrey was originally brought into Microsoft to help MS learn how to compete in the data center, but culturally they were so tied to the personal computer model of the world, that they fought him every step of the way.
Edit: Another interesting thing, is how Powershell exists because Windows isn&#x27;t file based. Jeffrey&#x27;s goal was server administration, but on Windows you can&#x27;t just edit files to administer things, you need to call various APIs and get structured data back forth. The rich object model fell out of that. It was the only way.
( Also, apologies if the transcript has errors. I&#x27;ve gone from professional transcriptions to Descript and then a pass of GPT4 trying to find the right punctation breaks and then me doing a quick read through. I don&#x27;t think its coming out as high quality as I&#x27;d like. )</span>

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s worth repeating: Unless you have a stake in the company, it is NOT your job to make sure the company is the most profitable it can be. Your job is to create great software
This is a terrible take, and one I generally see as a signal of lack of seniority in a software dev. It is absolutely everybody&#x27;s job in the company to make sure it is profitable, unless you work for a non-profit.
The thing is though, that profitable is not the same as &quot;just ship it&quot;. If you&#x27;re in a company where those things are conflated frequently, that&#x27;s a sign of lack of seniority in management.
&gt; Your job is to create great software
It really isn&#x27;t, your job is to make a great product. Making a great product often, but not always, requires great software. Many great products have terrible software behind them. The tension between product, sales and development should result in a compromise that creates the most value short, middle and long term. It is 100% your job as a developer to understand what can and cannot be hacked, what priorities the company has beside delivering great software, and finally: when great software must be made, because compromise is unwise.
Just like the boy who cried wolf, the developer who can never compromise on software quality is powerless when there is an actual reason to not compromise on software quality, and rightfully so.</span>

 An anarchist walks out of a punk show to smoke. On her vest are anarchist patches with various standard slogans, “No Gods No Masters,” “Death To Transphobes,” “Kill Your Local Rapist,” “All Cops Are Bastards,” “Punch Nazis,” “From The River To The Sea Palestine Will Be Free,” “Make Total Destroy,” “The Only Good Cop Is A Dead Cop,” “Eat The Rich,” “Death Before Detransition” and… “Fire To The Prisons.” 
 A suddenly red-faced bystander trots up to her to argue.

 I thought further and said: “Why do men lie over problems of such great importance, even to the point of destroying themselves?” and they seemed to do so because although they pretend to know all, they know nothing. Convinced they know all, they do not attempt to investigate the truth. — Zara Yacob of Aksum (Tigray), 17th-century philosopher, in The Hatata Inquiries

The opinion polls currently forecast that the incumbent Conservative party will be heavily defeated after 14 years in government. The opposition Labour party is expected to gain a majority of over 250 seats, a record landslide, with the Conservatives getting less than 100 seats.

                              <span>I heard an interview with Rachel &quot;Yoga Girl&quot; Bråthén. She talked about how certain things in her past, like being vegan, became a kind of identity. It was all or nothing. &quot;This is me. This is who I am. End of story!&quot;
It&#x27;s easy to get too attached to that kind of self-image, whether it&#x27;s advocating for healthy eating or reviewing cell phones.
Looking back, I can relate to this myself. Yoga, meditation, mindfulness, weight training, blogging, and more have all served as a “false” sense identity for me at some point — at least to some extent.
Of course, it&#x27;s not what we do that&#x27;s the problem; it&#x27;s how we see ourselves in relation to what we do. You can have a million followers and still be the most grounded person in the world.
No matter how &quot;important&quot; or &quot;unimportant&quot; our roles in life are, it&#x27;s good to remind ourselves of this truth from time to time. Status and possessions come and go, but who we are on a deeper level remains.</span>

                              <span>A lot of my posts have covered stuff I don&#x27;t ever have the time of day to talk about. I work too much and almost all of my coworkers are conservative boomers. I don&#x27;t talk to most of them  much but every once in a while I&#x27;ll have to share a store with some of them. Sometimes they give me random phone calls. Luckily I have the option of just not picking up the phone.
I just don&#x27;t relate with the people I have to interact with on the regular. I mean we aren&#x27;t having heavy political conversations 24/7 but it just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable being around people who you know are the polar opposite of who you are.
I feel like being able to write about the stuff I never get to talk about is a healthy counterweight to that. I&#x27;m not a great writer, I know a lot of the stuff I write won&#x27;t be read for weeks, or possibly ever. Some of it might be boring or come across cheesy. Sometimes I cover really broad, uninteresting things.
But it has had the unexpected effect of making me feel more valid as a person. It feels odd saying that, but it&#x27;s true.
Maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t had a hobby I can get lost in for too long. Making the rounds in different indie web neighborhoods, learning little bits of CSS and bringing my vision to life one piece at a time does a pretty good job at keeping me from getting bored and letting my mind wander to stress. Then when I&#x27;m done with that for a while I can write some more. Sometimes I&#x27;m proud of it, sometimes I delete it after a couple hours.
It feels... healthier than doomscrolling. I prefer this over traditional social media because of the ownership and freedom, and the fact that I sort of get to whisper what I&#x27;m saying rather than blasting it over a megaphone and putting myself on stage in front of an audience riding algorithmic dopamine waves.</span>

                              <span>This reminds me of something that I heard once from a Chinese teacher. I can&#x27;t vouch for the accuracy of it, but he was definitely on to something: In the West, it is assumed that it is the speaker&#x27;s job to make himself understood to his listeners. In the East, it is the other way around.
In recent times, it seems like we&#x27;ve gotten even more extreme. The speaker or writer must not only spoon-feed the understanding, they also have to provide the motivation and the entertainment. Which I find sad, because some things you can&#x27;t get unless you go to the effort of extracting them yourself. (See many reproducible psychology findings about retention being highly correlated with depth of processing, for example.) It&#x27;s like the information equivalent of highly processed food.
I find myself falling into this trap on sites like this. An interesting but difficult article will be posted, I won&#x27;t immediately know what to think or where I stand on the topic, and I&#x27;ll flip to the comments so that I can get some part of the collective to tell me what to think and how to feel about it. Which is also sad.
In paintings, it is known that the viewer can get out more than the painter put in. It used to be the same with writing, but it feels like that is becoming more rare and less acceptable. If a reader can&#x27;t follow the argument, it&#x27;s automatically the author&#x27;s fault and a waste of the reader&#x27;s time. Heaven forbid the reader might need to exert some effort and grow in the gleaning.</span>

                              <span>According to Jensen it takes about 8000 H100s running for 90 days to train a 1.8 Trillion param MoE GPT-4 scale model.
Meta has about 350,000 of these GPUs and a whole bunch of A100s. This means the ability to train 50 GPT-4 scale models every 90 days or 200 such models per year.
This level of overkill suggests to me that the core models will be commoditized to oblivion, making the actual profit margins from AI-centric companies close to 0, especially if Microsoft and Meta keep giving away these models for free.
This is actually terrible for investors, but amazing for builders (ironically).
The real value methinks is actually over the control of proprietary data used for training which is the single most important factor for model output quality. And this is actually as much an issue for copyright lawyers rather than software engineers once the big regulatory hammers start dropping to protect American workers.</span>

                              <span>My secret protip: old Fujitsu desktop/nuc PCs. At least in Germany (Europe?) they are cheap on ebay since a lot of businesses use them and upgrade on a regular schedule.
If you care about power consumption like I do, you can Google &quot;$model energy consumption white paper&quot; which contains very accurate data about idle usage, for example https://sp.ts.fujitsu.com/dmsp/Publications/public/wp-energy...
In one case I had a nuc where on Linux after enabling power saving features for the sata controller, idle usage even fell to 5W when the pdf claimed 9.
Having an actual pc instead of a random sbc ensures best connectivity, expandability, and software support forever. With almost all sbcs you&#x27;re stuck with a random-ass kernel from when the damn thing was released, and you basically have to frankenstein together your own up-to-date distro with the old kernel because the vendor certainly doesn&#x27;t care about updating the random armbian fork they created for that thing.</span>

                              <span>The author links to the somewhat dystopian blog where the email sender is quite proud of their work. Their words (or perhaps that of an LLM):
&gt; Could an AI agent craft compelling emails that would capture people&#x27;s attention and drive engagement, all while maintaining a level of personalization that feels human? I decided to find out.
&gt; The real hurdle was ensuring the emails seemed genuinely personalized and not spammy. I knew that if recipients detected even a whiff of a generic, mass-produced message, they&#x27;d tune out immediately.
&gt; Incredibly, not a single recipient seemed to detect that the emails were AI-generated.
https://www.wisp.blog/blog/how-i-use-ai-agents-to-send-1000-...
The technical part surprised me: they string together multiple LLMs which do all the work. It&#x27;s a shame the author&#x27;s passions are directed towards AI slop-email spam, all for capturing attention and driving engagement.
How much of our societal progress and collective thought and innovation has gone to capturing attention and driving up engagement, I wonder.</span>

 There are anarchists who run after uprisings on other continents wherever the spotlights of the media fall. There are anarchists who talk about “fortress Europe” and they don’t even know which States are part of the EU. There are anarchists who struggle against the borders and they don’t even know where the Schengen frontier runs. There are anarchists who, like “good white men”, see in the “dark-skinned” non-EU people potential comrades, and they don’t even notice that there are European non-EU people.

 When I translated and published the pamphlet &quot;Individuality and the anarchist group&quot;, signed by one of the CCF cells, Guerilla Urbana Cell, I added in a note that I didn’t do it because I agree with the content, but to make public how much this project, in my opinion, has turned away from its original form of tension to propose (or re-propose) an anarchist individualism which, in some ways, can be found in the pages of a different insurrectionist theory, but in this case approaching or even in some points leading to formal ideas, that is the formal organization. 
 Similar proposals (informal platform, structured and specific organization…</span>

 Violence generates violence. Regardless of what is right or wrong, no matter how abstruse is the boundary between opposites and how easily they can converge. The word violence and the concept it expresses present deep mystifications to those who have the monopoly on it. All expressions of dissent are being disproportionately repressed… no surprise… ‘go and tell them that it’s springtime’ [rough translation of ‘vagli a spiegare che è primavera’, a verse by the late anarchist singer and song-writer Fabrizio De Andrè].

Over the last 7 years, I have exclusively focused on trading. Well, to be fair, it&#x27;s more so the last 5 years. The first 2 years as a retail trader, I had one of those so called &quot;well-rounded lives&quot;. I traded, went out often, hung out after the close with friends &amp; fam, enjoyed snowboarding, camping, and mountain biking more than most.

                              <span>Yesterday, I found out that I have been celebrating the wrong day for a quarter of a century.
Let me back up a little bit…
I’m pretty good at remembering dates. If a date was at some point important to me, or I make a conscious effort to remember a date, it typically sticks with me. This can be a good, bad or absolutely useless talent depending on how you look at it. I even remember the date of when my first “serious” boyfriend asked me to be his girlfriend the summer before high school. I frequently remind my parents about my grandparents’ upcoming death anniversaries because they never seem to remember. I am basically a (niche) walking calendar.
So of course, I have deemed myself in charge of reminding my family on when we first set foot on US soil. Every year on July 3rd, I remind them of the date, and they just accept it as truth.
Except this year.
This year, my dad beat me to the punch. He texts the family group chat on July 2nd (yesterday) to let me know that it’s been 26 years since we first touched down in Newark International Airport in New Jersey. Of course, I countered and said that he was a day early (because I have literally been reminding them for the past 25 years). My mom jumps in with just a “No. July 2nd” before my dad shows the stamp on our passport that literally said: US IMMIGRATION: JULY 2, 1998 and said “Proof”. I imagined him doing a mic drop after that text.
So for the past 25 (now 26 years), I’ve been celebrating commemorating the wrong day, and no one bothered to correct me until now.
Oops.
Anyways, here’s to 26 years (+a day) of living here (I guess).

                              <span>This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).</span>

Translator’s Introduction
 At the dawn of the 20th century, Europe hosted a brief blossoming of individualistic thought. Inspired by the great thinkers of the preceding century such as Stirner, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and Spencer, they offered a free-thinking, non-dogmatic alternative to the increasingly powerful Marxists and syndicalists of the left, and the economists and theologians of the right. Importantly, this generation of thinkers developed the critique of the State into a critique of society as a whole, which immunized them from recruitment by the anarchist movement. As Ryner says in the Handbook, the anarchists are naive: victory by the anarchist…</span>

 Abuse is ubiquitous in our society, and as a result there are very few among us, if any, who have not been abused themselves or in proximity to someone else being abused. Myths about why and how abuse occurs run rampant and the ones that dominate are ones that ultimately serve in the maintenance of the status quo that keeps victims disempowered and silent. As a result, even those few who do actually believe victims of abuse and see the danger such abuse poses to them still often respond to the conditions the victim is entrapped within in ways that ultimately affirm the abuser’s narrative and fur…</span>

 An accident. An accident tore a family apart. An accident took a brave and kind comrade from us. We will remember the date. It was December 2023. 
 Death will come for us all. But, for now, we must put our shattered hearts back together. We need to organize. We need to fight. We need to grieve. Yet, we are not free to grieve, the same way we are not free to be. Not free to love. Not free to live. Countless surviving families and friends were vultured in one of their most vulnerable times. Countless victims of patriarchal honor killings were buried by their murderers. Count…</span>

Notes: From Sheffield Action Group’s Troublemakers zine, this important piece stands on its own

 As students at university, we have a lot more to say about the global and national role of our institutions — this will come at another point. For now we will focus on primary and secondary school. Many reading this will have left 13 years of schooling, likely hating most of it, and may not have thought a lot about the scale of its impact on our lives and how things could have been so, so different. 
 School is a class stratifier along eugenic lines. Those deemed more intelligent by their ability to absorb and spit out information in tests are seen as more suited for higher paying jobs and therefore, by this society’s lo…</span>

 Imagination is a magic carpet

 To distant lands and climes 
 And even go beyond the moon 
 To any planet in the sky 
 If we came from nowhere here 
 Why can’t we go somewhere there?

 I end up spending a lot of time in Jimbocho, the old bookseller’s district in Tokyo. Hours and hours I rifle through piles and stacks of dusty pulp hunting for gems.

 Generally men, rightly or wrongly, claim to have an intellectual and moral superiority over women, in addition to physical superiority. So be it! I want to grant it. 
 Strangely enough, in the vast majority of cases the man who considers himself superior to the woman takes little or no effort to reduce her inferiority and to raise the woman to his level. 
 This happens more especially among men who have a wife or partner. It would be logical that, if only out of a feeling of pride, the h…</span>

 And they said, oh, are you the the lads that have come to fight in Lebanon? And we said yeah, that’s us. And we sat in the back of this Peugeot car and I remember Lero nudging me, and there was a handgun underneat the dashboard and there was a butt of what was a Kalashnikov underneath one of the seats.

 The ecological crisis profoundly impacts the material conditions of social reproduction, extending beyond “natural disasters” to encompass a deepening of the contradictions inherent in capitalism. This crisis does not only manifest itself in events like floods, droughts, and pandemics, it also plays a direct role in fueling conflicts, social unrest, and mass displacement. In what follows, we attempt to lay out a comprehensive argument for the connection between the ecological crisis and the rise of what we call the post-fascist current, a poli…</span>

 In its Spring 2001 issue, the Oregon-based magazine Green Anarchy ran an anonymous article with the title: “The EZLN is NOT Anarchist: Or Struggles at the Margins and Revolutionary Solidarity.” Writing from an anarchist perspective, the author advanced a fierce critique of the Zapatista National Liberation Army—the militant anticolonial, anticapitalist Indigenous movement which had led an uprising and established autonomous zones in southern Mexico several years before, and which is often cited by anarchists as an example of a suc…</span>

 The Kate Sharpley Library aims to preserve the history of the anarchist movement and record and commemorate the lives of the people who made up the movement. It’s always good to see other people plugging away at the same task. The first translation of a piece by Imanol that we put up was ‘The Massana Gang’ which went in KSL: Bulletin of the Kate Sharpley Library No. 97–98, February 2019.

 Intro SCI Rockview is a prison in central Pennsylvania where incarcerated comrades have been facing repression for demanding justice in the face of impunity by racist COs and following a year of prisoner deaths due to institutional toxicity and guard violence. We speak to an outside supporter about the situation at Rockview, the reactions of administration, inside / outside relationships and solidarity that have flared up.

 Israel is making sure it will be remembered in history as a pioneer of genocide. Multiple Israeli military sources have testified that the Israeli military is using AI to guide missile and bomb strikes against Palestinians[1]. If the Israeli military’s Artificial Intelligence determines that a person is a military member of Hamas, the Israeli military will systematically approve of a missile or bomb strike to murder that person and any civilians in the immediate vicinity.

 If there are two contemporary anarchist theorists whose work occupies and influences my thought the most, they are Kevin Carson and Wayne Price. Carson has spent a huge segment of his career not just reconstructing a mutualist political economy as an alternative to the anarchist default to the economics of Karl Marx but also making incredibly original contributions to the fields of decentralized technology/production and spontaneous organization theory. Wayne Price in turn has dedicated his mind to a task that at first seems wholly opposite to Carson’s: working to adapt Marxist economics and political strategy to an anarchist co…</span>

 A wave of campus building occupations took place in response to austerity measures following the recession of 2008. As today’s Gaza solidarity movement begins to experiment with encampments and building occupations, it could be instructive to learn from the previous generation of student activists. 
 On April 22, 2024, inspired by the resilience of the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University and other demonstrators around the country, students at Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, California occupied Siemens Hall. This represented the first confrontational bu…</span>

 On April 17, students at Columbia University and Barnard College set up an encampment in solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide at the hands of the Israeli military.

Abstract
 In this text, written as a speech for the 1st Anarchist Fair in Rio de Janeiro, contradictions of the historically predatory relationship of brazilian democracy with brazilian travestis and transsexuals are presented, paying attention to the ontological marginality of the travesti body under the capitalist patriarchy of white supremacy. Based on this reflection, transfeminist challenges to radical and anarchist…</span>

Title: If We Must Fight, Let It Be For The Social Revolution
Date: 1914
Notes: From “Mother Earth”, October 1914, New York City, published by Emma Goldman, edited by Alexander Berkman

 Society has plunged into a world-wide war, but we Anarchists, we cannot shed tears over its horrors, as do the Socialists and other so-called philanthropists. WE KNOW how industriously those same weepers have been piling up the fuel which made this conflagration certain. 
 Governments have made this war. The Austrian government ordered its slaves to sweep Servia with fire and sword. The German government snapped its fingers at the four million and odd Socialist voters, and ordered its slaves to invade Belgium. The American government with hypocritical sobs and sighs, ordered its slaves …</span>

                              <span>I really love the idea of having a Blogroll. When checking out a new blog, after reading and perusing said blog, I typically check to see if it has one. I think it’s one of the best ways to find new people to subscribe to, new content to read, and/or new perspectives to be exposed to. However, I don’t have one on my blog. Hypocritical? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just really personal preference.
I grew up in the days of MySpace, and this irrational want to be included in everyone’s Top 8. Then when you’re in their Top 8, you watch that list like a hawk in case you drop from Top 2 to Top 5, or even worse, drop off altogether. Granted, blogrolls are a bit different since there’s no hard limit on how many can be included (or specified order), but the idea is similar.
You see, I’m fine and OK with no…</span>

                              <span>I spent the long weekend clearing the cobwebs from my apartment.
The main purge was throwing out YEARS of old diaries and journals—all of them. Not one survived.
I&#x27;ve been thinking about doing this for a long time. Reading them made me feel horrible, and they all seemed to circle the same themes. Lugging those boxes full of journals to each new apartment felt tiresome. It was time to let them go.
I feel good about it. I&#x27;m free: to untangle myself from past narratives; from reinforcing and remembering things I don&#x27;t wish to remember; to change; to reinvent the person I want to be.
Next on the to-get-rid-of list: books, clothes, paper ephemera, apps, expired kitchen things, tucked-away closet articles, + bathroom items.
Sketchbook things: 

Polaroid-inspired pencil and marker drawing

There is a rough idea of what it will be about, but not much more than that. It usually works best this way, I think. As usual, my phone and computer are set to &quot;do not disturb&quot; when I&#x27;m writing.
Even the basic idea itself often comes out of some kind of void: when I&#x27;m walking, driving, or eating, for example. Poof! Suddenly something appears, like the characteristic light bulb symbol.
Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.
This is what Nikhil writes in the post Get Bored.
I think it&#x27;s so well put. That&#x27;s precisely how it is. Just as a document or canvas needs a blank surface to be used, we, as individuals, need an inner void to make room for creation.
Our lives are full of excellent opportunities to create these spaces. They&#x27;re there every day: we&#x27;re waiting for the elevator, we&#x27;ve stopped at a traffic light, or we&#x27;re in line at the grocery store. Magnificent opportunities for a moment of “boredom” — an invitation to creativity.
Your best blog post ever could appear the next time you&#x27;re on an escalator doing absolutely nothing.
“Bored to death” is the birth of creativity.

                              <span>Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.
But what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There’s no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there’s no sense of urgency in your mind, there’s calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.
When your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That’s when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.
Productivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That’s when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.
When you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.</span>

                              <span>Qualifier: Former US special operations operator that served in multiple wars.
My anecdotal take is there are many ways that shock and trauma can accumulate through training and war that are far beyond the minimal effects of an M4.
Firearms: While the primary weapons systems are the M4 and side arm (pistol), there are many weapons systems utilized by special operations such as sniper rifles, crew serve weapons, and niche small arms.
The M82 sniper rifle shoots a 50 BMG round. In either the bolt action or semi-auto versions they feel like you are getting punched in the face when you shoot them.
Crew serve weapons like the MK19 and M2 do pack a punch.  The MK19 is a machine gun that shoots 40mm grenades.  The M2 is a .50 cal machine gun.  These weapons systems are mounted, but the percussion of them is still far greater than an M4.
More niche arms like the M249 SAW, M16 HBAR, full-auto AKs, M240 Golf, MP9, etc are not as mild as the standard M4/M16.
Blasts: There are many types of blasts encountered such as Mortars (inbound and outbound), Flash Bangs, Entry charges, IEDs, Landmines, etc.  These do make your head ring if you are close enough to them.
In my own personal experience there are many other daily jarring events that aren&#x27;t nearly as sexy to talk about.  Riding in the back of a 5 ton will almost shake your brain out of your head.  Riding in an LCAC (hovercraft) is like riding in a 5 ton.  Doing boat work in Zodiacs will bounce you all over the place, especially when doing surf passages.  Doing hydrographic surveys right where the surf breaks will pound you for hours and make you a little sick afterwards. When your chute opens on a jump, if jumping round chutes, will make you see stars...the landing is not a soft pretty one like rectangle chutes...you hit the ground hard.
There are many more ways your body gets pounded on a daily basis far in excess of the weapons you use.</span>

This model combines the features of New Keynesian models that have been the workhorse for monetary policy analysis since the work of Woodford (2003) with inequality in wealth and income at the household level following the seminal contribution of Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018). We find that while inflation hurts everyone, it hurts the poor in particular. When the source of inflation is a supply shock, fighting inflation aggressively hurts the poor even more, however, while the opposite is true for demand shocks, as discussed in the companion post.</span>

                              <span>Agreed. I mainly manage and review code at this point in my career. I find many bugs, every once in a while finding something that would have caused an outage or notable problem for users.
What I find more though is code that isn&#x27;t thought through. Tech debt and code smell are real, and they affect the performance of a team. Nipping that in the bud takes quality PR reviews and time to meet with submitters around issues you find.
Knock on wood but working at the company I do now where I, along with my team, have made quality PR reviews normal.. our codebase is now enjoyable and fun to work on. I highly recommend it!
One key aspect is being “kind, not nice”. Be helpful when leaving comments in PRs, but don’t be nice for the sake of avoiding conflict.
Also if you find code reviews to be a waste of time I can reccomend one thing I do often - give warnings. I approve and give comments around things I’d like to be fixed in the future for similar PRs. I don’t hold up the merge for little things, but at the same time I won’t let the little things slide forever</span>

                              <span>Article III of the U.S. Constitution is incredibly brief [1].
I propose the Supreme Court be reconstituted such that for each case a panel of judges from the appellate courts is chosen by lot. They hear that case, write their opinion, and then go back to that work. New case, new lot.
Having a permanent bench of judicial oligarchs made sense before telecommunication. It doesn’t anymore. Every ancient democracy used randomness to control corruption. I think it’s time we took a lesson from them.
(Note: this could be done by statute. How the supreme Court is constituted is entirely left to Congress.)

                              <span>&gt;The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority&#x27;s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution.

I would consider this an extreme knee jerk take, but it&#x27;s Sotomayor saying it.

The President shouldn&#x27;t have the legal authority to conduct any drone strikes without a declaration of war from Congress. We&#x27;ve been ignoring the Constitution for a very long time.</span>

                              <span>This is from my point of view as an experienced developer and VFX artist, including in-depth knowledge of AE.
    A 30fps limit is surprising
    23.976 as an fps does not seem to be dealt with gracefully
    Clicking report bug should take me to a bug report form with info
    Interacting with &quot;rectangle&quot; is surprising because the corners aren&#x27;t draggable. Probably should default to full size
    I should be able to wind input fields by clicking and dragging on them, such as for rotation
    When I drag keys around in the dope sheet, and let go with momentum, they appear to keep moving and &quot;settle&quot; in a sort of random place. They should not do that
    I see that this momentum behavior is also in the play head in the timeline. It really should not do that.
    Putting in a value in the dope sheet should be enabled, and it should automatically set a key
    I liked the visualizations of the easing, but it should probably be communicated with the keyframe&#x27;s icon shape in the dope sheet like it does in AE.
    It is difficult to move a key to the beginning of the timeline.
    Architecturally, the preview rendering probably has to work the way it does in After Effects. Guaranteeing a real time visualization is pretty important.

I kind of stopped there because it&#x27;s a bunch of goal-less fiddling. This is really great, there is a tremendous amount of product development. Hopefully you will think deeply about your audience and objectives, and the amount of product development that goes into After Effects.</span>

Data extraction is a use case that fine-tuned models are fantastic at, so I&#x27;m not surprised that OP got good results. That said, I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s pretty easy to beat GPT-4 across many task types if you have a way of getting strong training data. We published some research[1] a week ago where we found that across 4 example tasks spanning creative summarization, question answering, data extraction and classification a fine-tuned Llama 3 8B was able to outperform GPT-4 on 3 of them. The key was to create a repeatable way of generating high-quality training data, which is also addressed in the post.

    On June 6, 2024, this signal handler race condition was fixed by commit
    81c1099 (&quot;Add a facility to sshd(8) to penalise particular problematic
    client behaviours&quot;), which moved the async-signal-unsafe code from
    sshd&#x27;s SIGALRM handler to sshd&#x27;s listener process, where it can be
    handled synchronously:

      https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/81c1099d22b81ebfd20a334ce986c4f753b0db29

    Because this fix is part of a large commit (81c1099), on top of an even
    larger defense-in-depth commit (03e3de4, &quot;Start the process of splitting
    sshd into separate binaries&quot;), it might prove difficult to backport. In
    that case, the signal handler race condition itself can be fixed by
    removing or commenting out the async-signal-unsafe code from the
    sshsigdie() function

both &quot;a previously-announced feature for dealing with junk connections&quot;, and a mitigation for the exploit class against similar but unknown vulnerabilities, and a patch for the specific vulnerability because it &quot;moved the async-signal-unsafe code from sshd&#x27;s SIGALRM handler to sshd&#x27;s listener process, where it can be handled synchronously&quot;.
The cleverness is that it fixes the vulnerability as part of doing something that makes sense on its own, so you wouldn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s the patch even looking at it.</span>

                              <span>Interestingly, the RCE fix was &quot;smuggled&quot; in public almost a month ago.
    When PerSourcePenalties are enabled, sshd(8) will monitor the exit
    status of its child pre-auth session processes. Through the exit
    status, it can observe situations where the session did not
    authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
    repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly indicating
    an attack against one or more accounts, e.g. password guessing), or
    when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly indicating
    attempts to exploit sshd).

    When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of some
    duration (e.g. 30 seconds) against the client&#x27;s address.

https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/81c1099d2...
It&#x27;s not really a reversable patch that gives anything away to attackers: it changes the binary architecture in a way that has the side-effect of removing the specific vulnerability and also mitigates the whole exploit class, if I understand it correctly. Very clever.</span>

Title: Anti-Social Anarchy
Subtitle: A Short Response to Ausonia Calabrese’s “Against Individualism”
Date: Mar 20, 2020
Notes: Warzone Distro
Source: anarchistnews.org

 Marxism shares one thing in common with other authoritarian ideologies: they are against the individual. Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or “anti-state communists,” they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin’s “Anarchism” or “Socialism”, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese’s Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. 
 The main gist of the essay is that individuals ar…</span>

In a revolt against techno-optimism and the real-world violence it upholds, members of radical research collective Lucy Parsons Labs (LPL) call for an empiricism rooted in technopolitical critique. Drawing from their own years of labor in the struggles against racial and surveillance capitalism, current work in HCI, and radical theorists like Alfredo M. Bonanano and Modibo Kadalie, LPL invites us to incorporate an ethics of rebellion and progress our tech practices into principled, anti-authoritarian praxis.

                              <span>Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Treasury has issued debt in two main forms: nominal bonds, which provide fixed-cash scheduled payments, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—or TIPS—which provide the holder with inflation-protected payments that rise with U.S. inflation. At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike. After briefly reviewing the theoretical and empirical links between TIPS and Treasury yields, this post, based on a recent research paper, explores whether market perceptions of U.S. sovereign credit risk can help explain the relative valuation of these financial instruments.</span>

Yes, there&#x27;s a full city beneath those trees.
However, this is not what the land originally looked like.
To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It&#x27;s known colloquially as eGoli, or &quot;The City of Gold&quot;. Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don&#x27;t have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it&#x27;s mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.
This form of extraction leads to the crushing of millions of tons of ro…</span>

While I had already conceptualized and begun writing this piece prior to the publication of “An Anarchist Anti-Gun Manifesto,” the final form of “No Such Thing as Neutral” has been largely influenced by the response to the former. In particular, I was inspired by the common response of guns being “a tool” and “therefore neutral,” of the assumption that my critique of guns, and their world of relations, was of a moral character, and as such the concept of “neutrality” would hold some rhetorical weight. This piece is an attempt to break out of the confinement of moral frameworks …</span>

 We must bear in mind that no government, honest as it is, can decree the abolition of misery. It is the people themselves, the hungry, the disinherited, who have to abolish misery. – Ricardo Flores Magón (Regeneration, Nov. 19, 1910)

 This afternoon we met with Dolores Villalobo from the Consejo Indígena Popular de Oaxaca “Ricardo Flores Magón” (CIPO-RFM). She began the discussion with an explanation of who was Ricardo Flores Magón–an Indigenous person from Oaxaca who rose up against Porfirio Diáz in the Mexican Revolution. He was persecuted so fled into exile into the United States, but was imprisoned at Levenworth where he was executed. Franciso Madero offered him the vice presidency, but Flores Magón said he preferred jail to his government that was not of the people and who did not represent the change for which they had fought.

What is Anarchism?
 Anarchism is a political theory which opposes the State and capitalism. It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one. 
 Anarchism is also a political movement. Anarchists take part in day-to-day struggl…</span>

INTRODUCTION.
 I have been through a lot. For more than a decade now, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has waged a state terror program designed to drive down me to suicide in order to permanently silence me and, in the process, amassed over four thousand pages of files on me, less than three hundred pages of which they ar…</span>

Special introductory note by the editors
 In the “Policies of this Website” we explain that we are seeking to promote discussions “where participants are engaged in active listening and a search for commonalities or convergences—giving at least as much emphasis to this as we do to ‘clarifying differences.’ The overall goal of our project is not just to recapitulate well-established views but to transcend them if/when we can in order to create a stronger collective synthesis of revolutionary thought.”

Introduction
 What if we didn’t need bosses, politicians, borders, landlords, police, or prisons? 
 There was a time when each of these things did not exist, and whatever you may believe now about their absolute necessity, have you considered that there can be a time again when we can do much better without them? 
 Anarchists dare to desire a world without rule. 
 Neither the rule of the minority nor the rule of the majority. Neither the rule of the capitalists nor the rule of the bureaucrats. Neither the rule of men nor the rule of royalty nor the rule of the elderly nor the rule of warlords. An-archy. Without rule.

 On March 28, 2024, the streets surrounding Milan’s main courthouse, the Palace of Justice, are swarmed with different branches of Italian law enforcement. The municipal police have brought one patrol car, casually parked next to a newspaper kiosk. State police and military police (the Carabinieri) can be seen on the side streets, sporting riot gear in their trademark armored vans, light and dark blue respectively.

The simian redemption
 “You don’t know nothing, but you don’t need to know. The wisdom’s in the trees, not the glass windows”. – Jack Johnson[1]
 A lot of theories have surfaced in the relatively new millennium concerning the human species’ relationship to the planet it calls home. Historically, the mechanized view on nature advocated in the 17th century Scientific Revolution is criticized by ecological movements as alienating humanity from its origins. With the advent of the clock for example, man started measuring time according to its own inventions, exempting the sun of this function. Likewise, the clock became a metaphor for the machinery of nature, and “God” bec…</span>

 What happened to the notion of revolution? In his companion piece to “The Movement of Refusal,” Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen retraces the rise and fall of revolutionary theory from its earliest systematic expression during the First International to the first proletarian offensive of 1917–1921, and onwards to the crisis at the hands of a bourgeois “anti-fascism” that instrumentalized the specter of fascism as a means to save capitalism, before ditching it, after 1945, in order to integrate the laboring class into the nation state. Although the post-war welfare state was the great achievement of the workers’ movement, the price paid for it was the ab…</span>

Title: Scenes from the pro-Palestine encampment at OttawaU
Source: https://mutualrage.wordpress.com/2024/05/03/what-the-student-pro-palestine-encampments-are-actually-like/

 The other day my friend and I decided we wanted to visit the student-led pro-Palestine encampment that has recently sprung up on the lawn of OttawaU. On one of the organizing group’s social media pages, they had recently sent out a message informing people they were accepting donations, specifically of certain types of things (like hot water, garbage bags, blue tarps, yoga mats, etc.). I felt driven by the urge to donate whatever I could – so, during my shift, I furtively searched the back storeroom, digging through years’ worth of defunct paper cups, lids, and out-of-season teas. There was enough …</span>

A large swath of research in mathematics education claims to serve an equity agenda. However, too often this research is conducted atheoretically, failing to disrupt the worldviews that produce injustice and oppression, for both the researcher and the reader. Responding to this commonplace divergence of intent and impact, we propose a methodological approach that anchors research and praxis in a sociopolitical foundation of anarchism. We seek cohesion of theory and practice by consciously demanding that values common to the equity agenda—cooperation, mutual a…</span>

Abstract[1] [2]
 In this text, written as a speech for the 1st Anarchist Fair in Rio de Janeiro, contradictions of the historically predatory relationship of brazilian democracy with brazilian travestis and transsexuals are presented, paying attention to the ontological marginality of the travesti body under the capitalist patriarchy of white supremacy. Based on this reflection, transfeminist challenges to radical and anarchist politics are presen…</span>

 Comrades, 
 As I find we are now boycotted by the Sheffield Telegraph, which, no doubt, while it silences us, will continue, with its usual sense of fair play, to attack us in its columns, I write to you for the satisfaction of the only public we respect, namely, the workers.

 ‘Metacrisis’ is my chosen umbrella term for the escalation of multiple global crises of climate, ecology, and political economy, which have reached such a point now that all radical organising is a form of crisis response. And I know for folk on the sacrificial frontlines of capitalism, the terms ‘radical organising’ and ‘crisis response’ belie that they have to fight just to survive.

Same on the Mac: If you want to build a Mac application, your best bet will be AppKit or SwiftUI and using system controls. And when the OS updates your application will either update with it, or need only minor tweaks and a rebuild to look good.</span>

That&#x27;s not a problem, it&#x27;s a feature. I am absolutely bloody sick of apps that go out of their way to reinvent the standard UI controls in perplexing ways and behave unexpectedly. Following the system UI preferences is what you should do, and it irritates your users if you don&#x27;t.
There is a “hidden” dark mode for Win32 controls used by Windows File Explorer that you can activate, but it covers only some of the controls and still doesn’t look good.
Don&#x27;t do that. If you use the regular Win32 controls then they will automatically get the styling the user has set.
I&#x27;ve been writing Win32 apps for close to 30 years now. It&#x27;s sad to see the regression in UIs over the years.</span>

                              <span>This is a good overview of some of the options, but the author’s specific requirements push it in a specific direction that eliminates a lot of options.
Specifically, the requirement for completely custom GUI styling without writing his own render functions means it’s really a task of selecting easy, customizable GUI libraries rather than generic GUI work.
The requirements to be self-contained executables and under a 40MB limit also rule out a lot of options. The author admits that Qt could have met these requirements but the open-source licensing part wasn’t compatible with his goals and he didn’t want to pay for a license.
If you relax the requirements to tolerate some dependencies, allow larger download sizes, or to simply use built-in Windows GUI controls the situation is very different.
For writing a lightweight, completely custom GUI with no external dependencies and permissive licensing I could have guessed ImGui would be the answer before I started reading.</span>

                              <span>I was an infantryman in the Army for ten years, from 1998 to 2008, and deployed three times, twice to Iraq,
Encounters with IEDs were common, especially during the surge.
So many of my friends have died to suicide or have killed themselves due to drugs and/or alcohol that it is hard to keep track.
Now that primadonna seals are dying maybe someone will pay attention.
Thankfully the only lasting effects of my deployments seem to be a bad back and distaste for authority.</span>

Not mentioned in this article, but certainly related, was the Canadian governments unprecedented step to freeze hundreds of bank accounts of protestors during COVID protests using their Emergencies Act. While I couldn&#x27;t be more politically removed from the protestors, using a legislative power envisioned for war like conditions to personally ruin protestors financially is more than worrying.

                              <span>So, here goes.
Being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is especially hard when I live alone, well, sort of. I don’t talk much with my mom. Maybe I should, but I don’t intend to talk to her for the moment. That means, despite living with her under the same roof, I feel very lonely. And my mental health starts to deteriorate when I am alone and bored.
Thoughts could drive someone crazy when that is all they have being the single person in the room.
I am turning to y’all for support, so please write me emails at corneliuswastaken@proton.me. I would love anything. Book /music/video games recommendations, memes, photos of your pet, tell me about yourself. Heck, send me a string of random letters and numbers if you want. It is just nice to know that there is someone out there listening to my rambling, and that I am not alone. Expect the reply to happen in a while though. Replying to messages becomes a chore when self-care is in dire need.
Thank you.</span>

                              <span>Today is apparently National Camera Day. I have no idea who comes up with these seemingly random National holidays, but I’m here for it.
And so today got me thinking of some of the digital cameras I’ve owned in the past. I’ve owned quite a few that I regrettably no longer own, or have forgotten so we’ll start the with the ones I do remember.
A handful of Canon Coolpix: loved these things, and I feel like they’re making a comeback. I think I owned 2-3 of these in the early days. At one point, my university gave me one to document my “life as a student” as a part of their marketing campaign.
Nikon D40: my very first DSLR. I remember working endless amounts of hours at Staples over the summer to save up enough money to buy this on my own. This was around when it first came out, and was roughl…</span>

Title: The Last War

 The great European war has come. The truth has almost staggered our imagination, we do not know what to do and the one only definite thought is that we must win. To this end all our efforts are bent. We fight, with the men and women of France, of Russia, of Belgium. It is exactly the same, alas! with the men and women of Germany and Austria. We are all prompted by the same strong feelings of patriotism. We and they rejoice to give our lives that our country may be victorious, and more than all do we each rejoice if we may take the life of another. 
 Such is war. It is strange, is it not? Almost to a man we, in the countries concerned, have thrown aside what belief we …</span>

1. Introduction
 Mahayana Buddhism divides human history into three ages: the Age of the Right Dharma (shōbō), which occurred in the first 500 years after the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, where enlightenment was fully possible and the Buddha’s teachings were maintained; the Era of Semblance Dharma (zōhō), the 500 years following the shōbō era, where the Buddhist teachings and practice still existed but were deteriorated and lacked confirmed enlightenment; and finally, the Dharma-Ending Age (mappō), in which gradually all teachings bequeathed by the Buddha wi…</span>

Introduction
 Making the shift to the consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that we can do to build a democratic society. Consensus can give us the power we need to focus our society’s attention on improving education, making peace, providing universal healthcare and creating the world we desire. 
 Consensus creates true democracy—not the democracy in name only that sickens any aware person. Consensus empowers all who participate in it. In-name-only democracy disempowers all who participate in it (who dutifully trudge to the polls every few years to select new masters). True democracy might be a large part of the solution to …</span>
