I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was.

Title: The Consequences to Rahtid

This piece, authored by Joseph Edwards—also known as Fundi or the Caribbean Situationist—offers a unique perspective within the anti-authoritarian tradition of the Caribbean left.
Assumed to be the first publication of the Trinidadian labor organizing group, The New Beginning Movement (NBM) (1971–1978), this booklet was released as Abeng Pamphlet No. 1. The NBM drew inspiration from the Black Power Revolt and the legacy of C.L.R. James, applying his concepts of workers’ autonomy and self-management to forge a Pan-Caribbean International that extended links to Canada, th…</span>

                              <span>Putting concerns about future states aside, congrats to the Pixelmator team. I&#x27;ve been using the app for years and it&#x27;s a really great piece of software, well designed and well built. It&#x27;s always been incredible value for the price, especially given that it basically replaces Photoshop for a wide swath of the market without compromising on UX (which is a problem for other competitors) at a price point that&#x27;s like 1-2 months of an Adobe subscription (I don&#x27;t even know exactly what that costs any more because Pixelmator + parts of the Affinity suite got me out of their clutches).
Adobe must not be stoked about this news. And I&#x27;ll just keep my fingers crossed this all heads in a direction that&#x27;s more Logic than Dark Sky.</span>

When Apple acquired DarkSky, they absolutely destroyed a service that I loved and relied on. Four years on, Apple Weather is less reliable than DarkSky, and not even close to feature complete.
But DarkSky was a cross-platform service, whereas Pixelmator is software that&#x27;s already Apple-only. I&#x27;m wondering how much I should be worried, and if I should already be abandoning ship.</span>

                              <span>This might sound stupid but I refuse to go to dentists that have &quot;too nice&quot; of an office.
Over the years I have lived in several places and had a variety of dentists and one common theme that sticks with me, the nicer and higher tech the office is, the more procedures they are going to recommend you. They need to pay for the equipment and office somehow.
I&#x27;ve had one dentist say I need 3 cavities filled. That I needed laser treatments, extra cleanings, etc. They made it sound like my teeth were going to fall out of my head. I was going to Brazil in a few months and so i decided to wait until I was there to get the work done.
The dentists there took xrays, etc and didn&#x27;t find any problems. I even went to another dental clinic and the same thing. They had no idea what that dentist thought was wrong.
When I came back to the states i went to another dentist. Instead of being on a top floor with an army of technicians and the fanciest machines like the first one, this dentist had a small older office. He did the cleanings himself and again he found no problems and told me I had very healthy mouth and gums.
This has happened to me before when i went away to college my childhood dentist said I had cavities that I needed to fill. When i got to college and went to the dentist there, they couldn&#x27;t find a problem.</span>

I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context.
It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter.
Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander&#x27;s family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. Thi…</span>

Some very exciting news in the world of Beastieball: the Early Access release date has been set for November 12th! That&#x27;s like, less than 2 weeks away... I better get everything ready...
Here&#x27;s the trailer!!


But wait, you want more?
Well. Okay.
How about the BEASTIEBALL Original Sound Track? It&#x27;s now up for pre-order on Bandcamp!!
BEASTIEBALL Original Sound Track by Lena Raine

I wanted to take a moment to talk about how I&#x27;ll be releasing the OST, since it&#x27;s my first Early Access game:
When the game first releases, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of music in the game! 61 tracks, with an estimated runtime of around 2 hours 40 mins. That&#x27;s about as much as Chicory had when it released in full! However, there&#x27;s a lot more music we want to add to the game on the road to its 1.0 r…</span>

                              <span>People who blog sometimes share advice, myself included. Advice about life, careers, relationships… anything, really. If it’s something someone has lived through, chances are they’ve got insights to offer. Sure, some might call it unsolicited advice, but you’re free to read it or skip it, so it doesn’t matter much in the end.
Here’s the secret: the advice bloggers give? It’s often as much for themselves as it is for you.
And that’s no surprise. Writing is often called therapeutic, meditative, or an exercise in self-reflection. All of those are true. As we write (as I’m doing right now) thoughts that we hadn’t even realized we had come bubbling up. Sometimes, these thoughts take the form of advice. Advice that’s just as relevant to us as it might be to anyone else.
So, is it a problem that the advice bloggers write is actually for them? I don’t think so. It’s obviously helpful for the bloggers themselves, who apparently needed it in the first place. And for readers, it could be just the advice they’ve been searching for, without knowing it. That’s the beauty of blogging: you can stumble upon a story that really speaks to you. Reaching just one person with a story is already a success.
So go ahead. Write your story, and put it out there for the world to see. There might be someone out there who truly needs to read it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure about you, but for me, the web feels untrustworthy these days. So much of the content is either AI generated or created just to sell something, it&#x27;s really hard to find authenticity online. How do you know what sites to trust? Where do you find quality content?
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for a couple of years now, trying to figure out a solution. I feel like we need to wall off parts of the web. You know, have a gated community to keep the riff-raff out. Of course, that feels a bit icky, and keeps out people who might be looking for a better web. It also creates an echo chamber, and that is another pressing issue with the internet. There is also the logistics of how you could do this. I mean, in a way, Medium does this with a login and blocking of articles and that …</span>

                              <span>Trumpism is capacious. It contains contradictions and absurdities. It borrows from the left and the right. An explosive mix of love and hate propels it. Anyone can afford the price of admission. They only need to embrace Trump, MAGA, and conspiracies.
MAGA was in force on a crisp Sunday afternoon outside Madison Square Garden in late October. I joined tens of thousands of faithful seeking entry to the Woodstock of fascism. The lineup featured some of the worst people in America: Elon Musk, Stephen Miller, Rudy Giuliani, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK, Jr., JD Vance, Tucker Carlson, Elise Stefanik, Trump’s progeny, C-list racists and cranks, and the Demagogue-in-Chief himself.  More

Describing nuclear energy using questionable adjectives like “reliable,” “safe,” “clean,” and “affordable,” all of which are belied by the technology&#x27;s seventy-year history, these tech behemoths were clearly interested in hyping up their environmental credentials and nuclear power, which is being kept alive mostly using public subsidies.

So I filled out my ballot, though not very joyfully, and drove to the drop-off site in our little mill town, where the ballot box was being &quot;monitored&quot; by four MAGA people, adorned in their red hats, who, undeterred by the drenching rain, recorded my arrival on their cellphones and asked to see my ID, a request I replied to with a customary Italian gesture, as I told them had left my papers in Juarez.

After evaluating some options and writing code in various programming languages and frameworks such as .NET/F#, Go, Rust, React, I eventually decided to write it in Ruby on Rails. Why? Because I was already familiar with Rails and because of that I could literally go 10x faster than I was with any of the aforementioned options that were quite new to me. I told myself that this was temporary, a proof of concept and that later on, I would rewrite it in a different language that wouldn&#x27;t let me shoot myself in the foot as easily as I tend to do with Ruby. The Rails application however quickly grew in functionality and my colleagues really liked the application. I could quickly build features that would make them more…</span>

Wise and true words, which also apply to writing.
When we get hooked on something we&#x27;re reading, it&#x27;s often the author&#x27;s &quot;art of noticing&quot; that draws us into the story. A character portrait, a setting, a situation. A sense of attention to details that transports the reader to that exact moment.
As bloggers, we have everything to gain by sharpening our attention. Every day, no matter how ordinary, is full of ingredients for exciting blog posts. By looking up and listening closely, we can easily contribute to every blog challenge that comes our way.</span>

So, I try and throw everything away so that I can rebuild from scratch.
After a couple of decades of starting a with a “clean slate” online and in my personal life, I’ve come to realize that there is no such thing. A clean slate doesn’t truly exist.
In order to have a clean slate, you would need to erase everything that came before. Sure, I can delete the blogs so the public does not see them, but I still wrote them. I still allowed these ideas and concepts to flow from my brain to my hands and manifest…</span>

                              <span>This is probably Google&#x27;s Altavista moment, by making their results crappier by the year in search of Ad dollars everyone has felt that there is a potential for search to be better and once that becomes available they&#x27;ll be in a continious game of catch-up.
Yes, Google has their own AI divisions, tons of money and SEO is to blame for part of their crappiness. But they&#x27;ve also _explicitly_ focused on ad-dollars over algorithmic purity if one is to believe the reports of their internal politics and if those are true they have probably lost a ton of people who they&#x27;d need right now to turn the ship around quickly.</span>

                              <span>Been thinking about this a lot [1]. Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?
The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple&#x27;s Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.
Combining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.
Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.
I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.

                              <span>Introduction
Recently there&#x27;s a report from Github on the rise of snake language to be the top on Github. Yes, Python overtakes Javascript!

Below is a nice time series graph showing language progression over time:

Inspired by this achievement, I once again write how to speedup Python to almost near C/C++ speed! The tools we are using: Codon and Cython to speedup integrate calculation in Python.
Python code
First lets take a look at the original python code.
def f(x):
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a, b, N):
    s &#x3D; 0
    dx &#x3D; (b - a) / N
    for i in range(N):
        s +&#x3D; f(a + i * dx)
    return s * dx

Fairly simple and straightforward.
Codon code
Now here&#x27;s the Codon version:
def f(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return x ** 2 - x

def integrate_f(a: float, b: float, N: int) -&gt; float…</span>

                              <span>About six weeks ago, I opened up a Duolingo account. I don’t have a great desire to become bilingual, but I’ve read about all the benefits of learning a new a language and I figured, what the heck. I started with Latin, which I was enjoying, but decided I should switch to something a bit more practical. Being in the United States, Spanish was the logical choice, and so I moved my lessons over to Spanish.
Every day, I take three or four minutes to do my little challenges. It’s been a fun little distraction, but one that occasionally irritates me. For example, I’ve mistyped and lost hearts, which of course, prompts the app to sell me a membership, something I’m not interested in at this time. I don’t allow many notifications from apps on my phone, so Duolingo sends me emails to remind me to …</span>

                              <span>I’ve come to realize that education works best when it’s built around the learner. Not just teaching someone information but lighting a fire in them to seek out knowledge on their own.
That’s when it all changes. When students are genuinely curious, and they’re allowed the freedom to explore that curiosity, they become teachers to themselves.
They’re learning not because they have to but because they want to. That inner motivation is what takes learning beyond just facts and assignments—it makes it something exciting and meaningful.

But how do we actually make this shift? I’ve been thinking a lot about that, especially when I look back on how much public schooling is still rooted in traditional “chalk and talk” methods. A teacher at the front, lecturing while students sit passively—it has…</span>

Trust me. Today, lots of people were disappointed that a well-liked Internet service, Omnivore, which allowed you to save articles to read later, subscribe to newsletters without using your personal email, and have some articles automatically archived, was turning off its servers on November 15. Some folks had just transitioned to using Omnivore, only to find that their efforts were now wasted. It was my favorite way to read a couple of my favorite writers, so I had to scramble to come up with an alternative.
People have seen it happen time and again. Huge, popular websites and companies have just disappeared or changed so completely…</span>

                              <span>I work for Google, and I just got done with my work day. I was just writing I guess what you&#x27;d call &quot;AI generated code.&quot;
But the code completion engine is basically just good at finishing the lines I&#x27;m writing. If I&#x27;m writing &quot;function getAc...&quot; it&#x27;s smart enough to complete to &quot;function getActionHandler()&quot;, and maybe suggest the correct arguments and a decent jsdoc comment.
So basically, it&#x27;s a helpful productivity tool but it&#x27;s not doing any engineering at all. It&#x27;s probably about as good, maybe slightly worse, than Copilot. (I haven&#x27;t used it recently though.)</span>

Apple is well on its way to ensure you can only run things they allow via app store, they would probably already be there if it wasn&#x27;t for the pesky EU.
If you send your computer/phone to Apple for repair you may get back different physical hardware.
Those things very much highlight that &quot;your&quot; Apple hardware is not yours and that privacy on Apple hardware does not actually exist, sure they may not share that data with other parties but they definitely do not respect your privacy or act like you own the hardware you purchased.
Apple marketing seems to have reached the level indoctrination where everyone just keeps parroting what Apple says as an absolute truth.</span>

                              <span>I really respect Apple&#x27;s privacy focused engineering. They didn&#x27;t roll out _any_ AI features until they were capable of running them locally, and before doing any cloud-based AI they designed and rolled out Private Cloud Compute.
You can argue about whether it&#x27;s actually bulletproof or not but the fact is, nobody else is even trying, and have lost sight of all privacy-focused features in their rush to ship anything and everything on my device to OpenAI or Gemini.
I am thrilled to shell out thousands and thousands of dollars to purchase a machine that feels like it really belongs to me, from a company that respects my data and has aligned incentives.</span>

How do people deal with this? I simply don&#x27;t understand the value proposition. Does Google now have 25% subtly wrong code? Or do they have 25% trivial code? Or do all their engineers babysit the AI and bugfix the subtly wrong code? Or are all their engineers so junior that an AI is such a substantial help?
Like, isn&#x27;t this announcement a terrible indictment of how inexperienced their engineers are, or how trivial the problems they solve are, or both?</span>

Very reasonable. Google can flag accounts as CP, but then a judge still needs to issue a warrant for the police to actually go and look at the file. Good job court. Extra points for reasoning about hash values.</span>

                              <span>What’s amazing is that in the past I’ve felt the need to upgrade within a few years.
New video format or more demanding music software is released that slows the machine down, or battery life craters.
Well, I haven’t had even a tinge of feeling that I need to upgrade after getting my M1 Pro MBP. I can’t remember it ever skipping a beat running a serious Ableton project, or editing in Resolve.
Can stuff be faster? Technically of course. But this is the first machine that even after several years I’ve not caught myself once wishing that it was faster or had more RAM. Not once.
Perhaps it’s my age, or perhaps it’s just the architecture of these new Mac chips are just so damn good.</span>

                              <span>Hi, I lead the teams responsible for our internal developer tools, including AI features. We work very closely with Google DeepMind to adapt Gemini models for Google-scale coding and other Software Engineering usecases. Google has a unique, massive monorepo which poses a lot of fun challenges when it comes to deploying AI capabilities at scale.
1. We take a lot of care to make sure the AI recommendations are safe and have a high quality bar (regular monitoring, code provenance tracking, adversarial testing, and more).
2. We also do regular A/B tests and randomized control trials to ensure these features are improving SWE productivity and throughput.
3. We see similar efficiencies across all programming languages and frameworks used internally at Google and engineers across all tenure and experience cohorts show similar gain in productivity.

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

back on cohost, i wrote occasionally about my game design preferences. it&#x27;s a little nervewracking for me to open up about it, admittedly. a lot of game enthusiast mindsets revolve around &quot;the harder the game, the better&quot; as a general philosophy. how people interpret or iterate on that philosophy can differ greatly, but no matter what, the general concept of &quot;challenge&quot; dominates game design discussions.

                              <span>I bought a Lamy Safari, my first fountain pen, a couple of weeks ago. I tend to get obsessed over things when I first get into them, and thus end up in an endless rabbit hole of research. I knew this would happen.
I go back and forth between purely taking digital notes for work and using pen and paper. For the past few years, I’ve switched to digital note taking because it’s easier to cmd + f to find what I’m looking for. However, with the constant game of musical chairs that is my dual-laptop setup for work, I end up using different applications for notes and, in turn, losing them anyway1.
And so, armed with this new pen I wanted to practice writing with, I decided to switch back to pen-and-paper mode, and back to the work notebook I’ve used on and off since 2017 2.
This is where I ran in…</span>

 An ‘inimitable singularity’: this is how Ronald Creagh described the American utopian communities he studied for his doctoral thesis. [1] But Ronald himself was also an inimitable singularity. 
 A cosmopolitan by family and culture, with British, Italian, Egyptian roots, he had studied in France and written his MA on the free thought periodicals in nineteenth century North America – after having been a priest for many years. He then turned towards the early anarchist movement; this led him to visit the CIRA library (Centre international de recherches sur l’anarchisme) in Lausanne, in the early ’70s.

 Ronald Creagh took great satisfaction from the fact that he was born in Alexandria, Egypt, a historic city that was the centre of ancient learning. He grew up in a multicultural milieu in Port Said, Egypt. He was the offspring of a British-Sicilian father and a Franco-Lebanese mother and was taught Sicilian by his paternal grandmother. He said that Sicilian was his first language. 
 In 1947, his family migrated to Australia, while Ronald moved to France to become a Roman Catholic priest. He took a degree in sociology at the Sorbonne, a masters’ degree at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, and then taught at the Institute of Human Sciences and Techniques and…</span>

 Longtime French anarchist scholar and activist Ronald Creagh died on September 8 at age 94. 
 He was in touch with anarchists and anti-authoritarians on several continents. Those who knew him personally appreciated his broad-minded openness and supportive spirit. 
 Some Fifth Estate staffers were among those who found him engaging and attentive in conversations on many subjects. In recent years he was a regular reader of our online current and past articles and enjoyed discussing them.

 Given the political crisis that Venezuela is going through and that was manifested in the events before, during and after April 11, we anarchists consider it necessary to state our position. In this regard, therefore: 
 1) Hugo Chavez&#x27;s contradictory policies have not benefited the most disadvantaged sectors of the country, increasing in three years of management the rates of poverty, unemployment and social insecurity. In addition, his government repeats errors and vices characteristic of previous ones. But in no way do the sectors of the current oppositi…</span>

 But still we know that when the Europeans came, the Bushmen lived in small tribes (or clans), sometimes federated together; that they used to hunt in common, and divided the spoil without quarrelling; that they never abandoned their wounded, and displayed strong affection to their comrades.

Translator’s Note
 Until the post-Cultural Revolution thaw that began in 1979, Chinese readers found it next to impossible to gain access to information about the strong anarchist influence within their country’s revolutionary movement. From the point of view of the ruling Communist Party, in whose favour historical materials were invariably rewritten, this was a necessity borne out by the fact that, when people took to the streets in 1989 to demand a degree of control over their own lives, among t…</span>

                              <span>As a programmer of over 20 years - this is terrifying.
I&#x27;m willing to accept that I just have &quot;get off my lawn&quot; syndrome or something.
But the idea of letting an LLM write/move large swaths of code seems so incredibly irresponsible. Whenever I sit down to write some code, be it a large implementation or a small function, I think about what other people (or future versions of myself) will struggle with when interacting with the code. Is it clear and concise? Is it too clever? Is it too easy to write a subtle bug when making changes? Have I made it totally clear that X is relying on Y dangerous behavior by adding a comment or intentionally making it visible in some other way?
It goes the other way too. If I know someone well (or their style) then it makes evaluating their code easier. The more time I spend in a codebase the better idea I have of what the writer was trying to do. I remember spending a lot of time reading the early Redis codebase and got a pretty good sense of how Salvatore thinks. Or altering my approaches to code reviews depending on which coworker was submitting it. These weren&#x27;t things I were doing out of desire but because all non-trivial code has so much subtlety; it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.
So the thought of opening up a codebase that was cobbled together by an AI is just scary to me. Subtle bugs and errors would be equally distributed across the whole thing instead of where the writer was less competent (as is often the case). The whole thing just sounds like a gargantuan mess.
Change my mind.</span>

You don&#x27;t just acquire $7T.
The ENTIRE US domestic Net Investment isn&#x27;t even $1T: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W790RC1Q027SBEA
Gross Fixed Capital Formation (Net Investment + Deprecation) isn&#x27;t much more: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFIRSAXDCUSQ
Google, Apple, and Microsoft together don&#x27;t even spend $100B on CapEx per year. And they&#x27;re worth almost $10T put together.
Asking for $7T when you&#x27;re a $100B company is so ridiculous it&#x27;s beyond belief.</span>

                              <span>This article doesn’t understand what was fundamentally wrong with Ballmer’s leadership and what Nadella actually changed.
The specific technologies that were successful is irrelevant. Microsoft has and continues to invest in nearly every computer related technology that may come around the corner or they got late on.
The problem with Microsoft was everything went through Windows. The entire company was designed to promote Windows.
This was the fundamental flaw with Microsoft that Nadella changed. He quickly not just made Windows just another part of Microsoft’s business, to a great extent he actively devalued it.
The fact that Ballmer invested in Azure, etc before Nadella would all be irrelevant because under Ballmer Azure would have remained a red headed step child to Windows, so it’s unlikely to have seen much success under him anyways. Same goes for pretty much everything else Microsoft is doing right now.</span>

                              <span>Funny story. I used to see Steve almost every weekday for a couple of years.
I can&#x27;t speak to his business skills, but I can attest that he never once offered a tip for his daily black iced tea. We&#x27;d even have it ready for him before he showed up so he never had to wait! He would pay with cash, and I&#x27;d hand him his change and drink, and that was that.
It&#x27;s funny to me now: one of the richest men in the world and he never once offered a tip.
Frugality aside, he was always very polite and warm so I can&#x27;t be mad. Makes for a good ice breaker story.
Edit: holy moly, this is a sensitive subject. Please remember this was from a time before tipflation. Tipping meant you left your change behind once in a while only if you felt the desire to show appreciation. It wasn&#x27;t an obligation. Yes, I still do think it&#x27;s a funny story. Roast me for being entitled lol</span>

                              <span>&gt; How large is the Flutter team, today? Google doesn&#x27;t publish this information, but my guess is that the team is about 50 people strong.
&gt; That&#x27;s 50 people serving the needs of 1,000,000. Doing a little bit of division, that means that every single member of the Flutter team is responsible for the needs of 20,000 Flutter developers! That ratio is clearly unworkable for any semblance of customer support.
This is a weird exercise. Python, for example, is a #1/#2 language in the world and there&#x27;s only 50 active core devs, 90% of which don&#x27;t even work on Python full time. Somehow we make that work.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Most people don&#x27;t realize how many apps written in Flutter they use daily, simply because it&#x27;s impossible to tell
You can&#x27;t be serious. Maybe on Android, but on other platforms—especially iOS—they stick out like a sore thumb.
A number of them just look like Material Design Android apps awkwardly transplanted over, but I know that&#x27;s down to the developer so I won&#x27;t hold that against Flutter. But scrolling through the Flutter showcase[0] and calling those apps up to look at screenshots on the App Store—none of them look like native iOS apps. They don&#x27;t look bad (mostly), but they don&#x27;t fit in.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t expect anyone else to care or even notice. But for those of us that do care, you can absolutely tell.

If &quot;only&quot; 50 people working on a project used by one million people was unworkably low then every single successful project out there would be doomed. I&#x27;ve certainly worked on things with much worse ratios than that.
&gt; one has to critically assess why a team that loves external contributions has only managed to merge contributions from 1,500 developers over a span of nearly a decade.
External contributions from 1500 developers over a decade is a lot. That is an unusually high number, not a low one, and backs up Flutter&#x27;s claim to love external contributions.
The fact that this person thinks that they can just magically conjure up dozens of volunteer PR reviewers is wild. Everything about this post makes it pretty clear that they don&#x27;t have the slightest clue of the scope of what they&#x27;re trying to do. This feels like one of the standard examples of an ex-bigco person setting off on their own with no understanding how just how much the bigco did in the background to facilitate their job.</span>

                              <span>It gets so much worse. Today, my sales guy was trying to register for WordCamp, a conference that we have been attending for years as an essential place to meet customers. And then he encountered the registration form for a WordPress.org login, which neatly specifies that you affirm you have no “affiliation with WP Engine, whether financial or otherwise.” [1]
Of course, my company does have an affiliation with WP Engine. We use their service to host our website. Therefore, nobody on my team can register for a WordPress.org account.
I wrote an open letter to Matt Mullenweg complaining about the requirement and stating that I believe it violates the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act by being an overly broad prohibition that is clearly anti-competitive and has no clear business justification (aside from limiting competition).
Matt and the rest of the people backing Automattic should take note: Moves like this that destroy your community will eventually usher in a replacement. WordPress is pretty neat, but it only got that way because thousands of people put millions of hours into building add-ons and hosting services to make it blossom into what it is today. If their efforts are redirected in another direction, WordPress will wither away to nothing in a few years.

                              <span>Reading this on 2017 iMac 27&quot; - is the first 5k iMac that couldn&#x27;t be used as a monitor after the computer inside is irrelevant. 
I hope EU will push for some law that requires all AIO computers to work in monitor-only mode if internal hardware is no longer good enough or no longer supported by software updates.
I love the 5k screen on this iMac but the CPU is too old for photo or video editing as software got so much slower over the years. 
I could have used this screen for many more years, but now it will hit landfill... Apple is only &quot;green&quot; in their presentations - in reality they care more about inifite sales only.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that my son spends way too much time on YouTube or playing Minecraft and one of the few offline activities he enjoys doing on his own is coloring. And since he comes to me every time he wants a new coloring book and we spend about 10 minutes together searching for each picture, I made a website with a collection of coloring books for him. The site is very simple, but to be honest, I haven&#x27;t had so much fun with the process of creation for a long time.

This is not because we suddenly see the light, nor because our worst days are magically transmuted into some type of epiphany, and not because someone saves us from our own madness. Rock bottom becomes a turning point because it is only at that point that most people think: I never want to feel this way again.
That thought is not just an idea. It is a declaration and a resolution. It is one of the most life-changing things you can ever experience. It becomes the foundation upon which you build everything else.
When you decide you truly do not ever want to feel a certain way again, you set out on a journey of self-awareness, learning, and growth that leads you to radically reinvent who you are.
In that moment, fault becomes irrel…</span>

                              <span>I used to struggle with explaining why some of my friends or family members didn’t quite fit into any of the 16 MBTI personality types. A friend of mine seemed like an INFP but had traits of an ISTJ, and my cousin felt like an ESFP, yet was as considerate as an ESFJ.
Then I stumbled upon Personality Ninja (or &quot;NXT&quot;), which uses 32 types instead of just 16. Suddenly, things started to make sense.
At first, I thought, “What? There are only 16 types!” But after trying it out with friends, I realized their new descriptions actually felt accurate. This system offered flexibility and depth the original 16 types didn’t seem to capture.
Curious, I dove deeper into whether 32 types could really work—and found out there’s no reason they can’t! If you look back at Carl Jung, who created the concept of cognitive functions, he didn’t enforce the rigid stacks we see in MBTI or the Harold Grant function model.
Personality Ninja’s approach allows both the first and second functions to be in the same attitude (both extraverted or both introverted), unlike MBTI’s requirement for them to be opposites.
This flexibility means types don’t have to follow TeSi or SiTe formats—they can be TeSe or SiTi. It was the answer I’d been looking for: my friend turned out to be FiSi, while my cousin was FeSe.
So if you’ve ever felt stuck trying to fit yourself or others into the 16 types, it might be worth exploring the 32-type approach!</span>

Raphael Sassaki: How did you come up with the idea of Jerusalem, which tells a story that spreads through 1000 years in Northampton? How was the writing of it?
Alan Moore: Rather than originating from a single idea, Jerusalem is more the convergence of several different impulses and concepts. Foremost amongst these were the growing need to talk about the tiny but historically peculiar district I was raised in, and the simultaneous urge to talk about my family in a way that included both its history and its mythology. This, I soon realised, would require the proposed b…</span>

About a decade ago, I ventured my opinion that the adult multitudes queueing for superhero movies were potentially an indicator of emotional arrest, which could have worrying political and social implications. Since at that time Brexit, Donald Trump and fascist populism hadn’t happened yet, my evidently crazy diatribe was largely met with outrage from the fan community, some of whom angrily demanded I be extradited to the US and made to stand trial for my crimes against superhumanity – which I felt didn’t necessarily disprove my allegations. 
 Ten years on, let me make my position clear: I believe that …</span>

 If there is any event that can bring about a rediscovery of inner strength on the part of organized labor and the libertarian elements of the world, it is the grand struggle against Fascism now being waged in Spain. After the unresisting defeat of the labor movement in Germany the effect of the heroic battle of the Spanish workers, peasants, and intellectuals against the Fascist bandits is that of a refreshing thunderstorm.

                              <span>what a month.
cohost went read-only on the first. i went to a user meetup / wake in northampton the following weekend. i continued my job hunt (successful, btw). i tried (and largely failed) to rest. i learned that i am extremely bad at being unemployed.
everyone i talked to told me that it&#x27;s pretty normal to not do anything in that window, that it&#x27;s normal and reasonable to need a break. unfortunately, it did not feel like i was resting, it just felt like i couldn&#x27;t do anything (distinct! not fun!).
anyway. tomorrow i start a new job, which will give me some structure in my day again. i get novelty—meeting new people, working on new things, experiencing and solving new problems. i&#x27;m looking forward to it.
weird, rough month. i am tired. someday i will be able to rest, but it is not right now.
i want to actually keep up with this blog more. i hadn&#x27;t really realized it had been nearly a month since my last post. time flies. when i have things to write about, i&#x27;ll do it here. that&#x27;s about all i can promise.
ok that&#x27;s it bye</span>

                              <span>So, I finally did it. I talked about it already in this post about my hair troubles and finally went through with it and cut all my hair off.

I did it because my illness/medication related hair loss just didn&#x27;t stop for months now and I didn&#x27;t like any of it. The hair on all my clothes, on the floor, in the bed, the shower and sink drains. I never had especially voluminous hair; I was on the lower average of the amount, and it was fine hair. But with now less than half left and no signs of slowing down, it was shitty to style, was constantly stringy even when it wasn&#x27;t greasy, and had no volume at all. The edges of where my face met my hair were really thinning as well; thankfully no bald spots. I like having very long hair, but not when it is so little.
I also thought about the regrowth …</span>
