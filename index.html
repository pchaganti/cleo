                              <span>Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer
The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn&#x27;t mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here&#x27;s the chat and here&#x27;s the resulting interactive.
I spotted a bug with the way it indented code today so I pasted it into Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking mode and had it make a bunch of improvements - full transcript here. Here&#x27;s the finished code.

In many ways this is a perfect example of vibe coding  in action. At no point did I look at a single line of code that either of the LLMs had written for me. I honestly don&#x27;t care how this thing works: it could not be lower stakes for me, the worst a bug could do is show me poorly formatted incomplete JSON.
I was vaguely aware that some kind of state machine style parser would be needed, because you can&#x27;t parse incomplete JSON with a regular JSON parser. Building simple parsers is the kind of thing LLMs are surprisingly good at, and also the kind of thing I don&#x27;t want to take on for a trivial project.
At one point I told Claude &quot;Try using your code execution tool to check your logic&quot;, because I happen to know Claude can write and then execute JavaScript independently of using it for artifacts. That helped it out a bunch.
I later dropped in the following:
modify the tool to work better on mobile screens and generally look a bit nicer - and remove the pretty print JSON button, it should update any time the input text is changed. Also add a &quot;copy to clipboard&quot; button next to the results. And add a button that says &quot;example&quot; which adds a longer incomplete example to demonstrate the tool, make that example pelican themed.
It&#x27;s fun being able to say &quot;generally look a bit nicer&quot; and get a perfectly acceptable result!

                              <span>I was there at the first Atom meeting at the Google offices. We meant so well! And I think the basic publishing spec is good, certainly better technically than the pastiche of different things called RSS.
Alas, a bunch of things then went wrong. Feeds started losing market share. Facebook started doing something useful and interesting that ultimately replaced blog feeds in open formats. The Atom vs RSS spec was at best irrelevant to most people (even programmers) and at worst a confusing market-damaging thing. The XML namespaces in Atom made everyone annoyed. Also there was some confusing “Atom API” for publishing that diluted Atom’s mindshare for feeds.

                              <span>Tracing the thoughts of a large language model
delightful Golden Gate Claude last year, Anthropic have published two new papers about LLM interpretability:
Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models  extends last year&#x27;s interpretable features into attribution graphs, which can &quot;trace the chain of intermediate steps that a model uses to transform a specific input prompt into an output response&quot;.
On the Biology of a Large Language Model uses that methodology to investigate Claude 3.5 Haiku in a bunch of different ways. Multilingual Circuits for example shows that the same prompt in three different languages uses similar circuits for each one, hinting at an intriguing level of generalization.
To my own personal delight, neither of these papers are published as PDFs. They&#x27;re both presented as glorious mobile friendly HTML pages with linkable sections and even some inline interactive diagrams. More of this please!

GPT-4o got an another update in ChatGPT!
What&#x27;s different?
Better at following detailed instructions, especially prompts containing multiple requests
Improved capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems
Improved intuition and creativity
Fewer emojis 🙃
This sounds like a significant upgrade to GPT-4o, albeit one where the release notes are limited to a single tweet.
ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-0-26) just hit second place on the LM Arena leaderboard, behind only Gemini 2.5, so this really is an update worth knowing about.
The @OpenAIDevelopers account confirmed that this is also now available in their API:
chatgpt-4o-latest is now updated in the API, but stay tuned—we plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.
I wrote about chatgpt-4o-latest last month - it&#x27;s a model alias in the OpenAI API which provides access to the model used for ChatGPT, available since August 2024. It&#x27;s priced at $5/million input and $15/million output - a step up from regular GPT-4o&#x27;s $2.50/$10.
I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re going to make these changes available as a dated model release - the chatgpt-4o-latest alias is risky to build software against due to its tendency to change without warning.
A more appropriate place for this announcement would be the OpenAI Platform Changelog, but that&#x27;s not had an update since the release of their new audio models on March 20th.

                              <span>Thoughts on setting policy for new AI capabilities
noted some of those the other day.
Joanne summarizes these changes like so:
tl;dr we’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm. The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don&#x27;t know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.
This point in particular resonated with me:
Trusting user creativity over our own assumptions. AI lab employees should not be the arbiters of what people should and shouldn’t be allowed to create.
A couple of years ago when OpenAI were the only AI lab with models that were worth spending time with it really did feel that San Francisco cultural values (which I relate to myself) were being pushed on the entire world. That cultural hegemony has been broken now by the increasing pool of global organizations that can produce models, but it&#x27;s still reassuring to see the leading AI lab relaxing its approach here.

                              <span>Nomic Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever
The nomic-embed-code model is pretty large - 26.35GB - but the announcement also mentioned a much smaller model (released 5 months ago) called CodeRankEmbed which is just 521.60MB.
I missed that when it first came out, so I decided to give it a try using my llm-sentence-transformers plugin for LLM.
llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed --trust-remote-code

Now I can run the model like this:
llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed -c &#x27;hello&#x27;

This outputs an array of 768 numbers, starting [1.4794224500656128, -0.474479079246521, ....
Where this gets fun is combining it with my Symbex tool to create and then search embeddings for functions in a codebase.
I created an index for my LLM codebase like this:
cd llm
symbex &#x27;*&#x27; &#x27;*.*&#x27; --nl &gt; code.txt

This creates a newline-separated JSON file of all of the functions (from &#x27;*&#x27;) and methods (from &#x27;*.*&#x27;) in the current directory - you can see that here.
Then I fed that into the llm embed-multi command like this:
llm embed-multi \
  -d code.db \
  -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed \
  code code.txt \
  --format nl \
  --store \
  --batch-size 10

I found the --batch-size was needed to prevent it from crashing with an error. 
The above command creates a collection called code in a SQLite database called code.db.
Having run this command I can search for functions that match a specific search term in that code collection like this:
llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c &#x27;Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin&#x27; | jq

That &quot;Represent this query for searching relevant code: &quot; prefix is required by the model. I pipe it through jq to make it a little more readable, which gives me these results.
This jq recipe makes for a better output:
llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c &#x27;Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin&#x27; | \
  jq -r &#x27;.id + &quot;\n\n&quot; + .content + &quot;\n--------\n&quot;&#x27;

The output from that starts like so:
llm/cli.py:1776

@cli.command(name&#x3D;&quot;plugins&quot;)
@click.option(&quot;--all&quot;, help&#x3D;&quot;Include built-in default plugins&quot;, is_flag&#x3D;True)
def plugins_list(all):
    &quot;List installed plugins&quot;
    click.echo(json.dumps(get_plugins(all), indent&#x3D;2))
--------

llm/cli.py:1791

@cli.command()
@click.argument(&quot;packages&quot;, nargs&#x3D;-1, required&#x3D;False)
@click.option(
    &quot;-U&quot;, &quot;--upgrade&quot;, is_flag&#x3D;True, help&#x3D;&quot;Upgrade packages to latest version&quot;
)
...
def install(packages, upgrade, editable, force_reinstall, no_cache_dir):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Install packages from PyPI into the same environment as LLM&quot;&quot;&quot;

Getting this output was quite inconvenient, so I&#x27;ve opened an issue.

                              <span>Function calling with Gemma
via Ollama) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.
The first prompt uses Python-style function calling syntax:
You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
 you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1&#x3D;params_value1, params_name2&#x3D;params_value2...), func_name2(params)]
You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function
(Always love seeing CAPITALS for emphasis in prompts, makes me wonder if they proved to themselves that capitalization makes a difference in this case.)
The second variant uses JSON instead:
You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
you MUST put it in the format of {&quot;name&quot;: function name, &quot;parameters&quot;: dictionary of argument name and its value}
You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function
This is a neat illustration of the fact that all of these fancy tool using LLMs are still using effectively the same pattern as was described in the ReAct paper back in November 2022. Here&#x27;s my implementation of that pattern from March 2023.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve added a new content type to my blog: notes. These join my existing types: entries, bookmarks and quotations.
A note is a little bit like a bookmark without a link. They&#x27;re for short form writing - thoughts or images that don&#x27;t warrant a full entry with a title. The kind of things I used to post to Twitter, but that don&#x27;t feel right to cross-post to multiple social networks (Mastodon and Bluesky, for example.)
I was partly inspired by Molly White&#x27;s short thoughts, notes, links, and musings.
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a while, but the amount of work involved in modifying all of the parts of my site that handle the three different content types was daunting. Then this evening I tried running my blog&#x27;s source code (using files-to-prompt and LLM) through the new Gemini 2.5 Pro:
files-to-prompt . -e py -c | \
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \
  &#x27;I want to add a new type of content called a Note,
  similar to quotation and bookmark and entry but it
  only has a markdown text body. Output all of the
  code I need to add for that feature and tell me
  which files to add  the code to.&#x27;


Gemini gave me a detailed 13 step plan covering all of the tedious changes I&#x27;d been avoiding having to figure out!
The code is in this PR, which touched 18 different files. The whole project took around 45 minutes start to finish.
(I used Claude to brainstorm names for the feature - I had it come up with possible nouns and then &quot;rank those by least pretentious to most pretentious&quot;, and &quot;notes&quot; came out on top.)
This is now far too long for a note and should really be upgraded to an entry, but I need to post a first note to make sure everything is working as it should.

                              <span>Introducing 4o Image Generation
back in May 2024 one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The &quot;o&quot; stood for &quot;omni&quot;, and the image output examples in that launch post looked really impressive.
It&#x27;s taken them over ten months (and Gemini beat them to it) but today they&#x27;re finally making those image generation abilities available, live right now in ChatGPT for paying customers.
My test prompt for any model that can manipulate incoming images is &quot;Turn this into a selfie with a bear&quot;, because you should never take a selfie with a bear! I fed ChatGPT this selfie and got back this result:

That&#x27;s pretty great! It mangled the text on my T-Shirt (which says &quot;LAWRENCE.COM&quot; in a creative font) and added a second visible AirPod. It&#x27;s very clearly me though, and that&#x27;s definitely a bear.
There are plenty more examples in OpenAI&#x27;s launch post, but as usual the most interesting details are tucked away in the updates to the system card. There&#x27;s lots in there about their approach to safety and bias, including a section on &quot;Ahistorical and Unrealistic Bias&quot; which feels inspired by Gemini&#x27;s embarrassing early missteps.
One section that stood out to me is their approach to images of public figures. The new policy is much more permissive than for DALL-E - highlights mine:
4o image generation is capable, in many instances, of generating a depiction of a public figure based solely on a text prompt.
At launch, we are not blocking the capability to generate adult public figures but are instead implementing the same safeguards that we have implemented for editing images of photorealistic uploads of people. For instance, this includes seeking to block the generation of photorealistic images of public figures who are minors and of material that violates our policies related to violence, hateful imagery, instructions for illicit activities, erotic content, and other areas. Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out.
This approach is more fine-grained than the way we dealt with public figures in our DALL·E series of models, where we used technical mitigations intended to prevent any images of a public figure from being generated. This change opens the possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech. After launch, we will continue to monitor usage of this capability, evaluating our policies, and will adjust them if needed.
Given that &quot;public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out&quot; I wonder if we&#x27;ll see a stampede of public figures to do exactly that!
Update: There&#x27;s significant confusion right now over this new feature because it is being rolled out gradually but older ChatGPT can still generate images using DALL-E instead... and there is no visual indication in the ChatGPT UI explaining which image generation method it used!
OpenAI made the same mistake last year when they announced ChatGPT advanced voice mode but failed to clarify that ChatGPT was still running the previous, less impressive voice implementation.
Update 2: Images created with DALL-E through the ChatGPT web interface now show a note with a warning:

                              <span>There&#x27;s a new release from Google Gemini this morning: the first in the Gemini 2.5 series. Google call it &quot;a thinking model, designed to tackle increasingly complex problems&quot;. It&#x27;s already sat at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, and from initial impressions looks like it may deserve that top spot.

I just released llm-gemini 0.16 adding support for the new model to my LLM command-line tool. Let&#x27;s try it out.



  
The pelican riding a bicycle

  
Transcribing audio

  
Bounding boxes

  
More characteristics of the model

  
Gemini 2.5 Pro is a very strong new model

  
Update: it&#x27;s very good at code



The pelican riding a bicycle

First up, my classic generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle prompt.


# Upgrade the plugin
llm install -U llm-gemini

# Now run the prompt:
llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;

It&#x27;s pretty solid!



Here&#x27;s the full transcript.

This task is meant to be almost impossible: pelicans are the wrong shape to ride bicycles! Given that, I think this is a good attempt - I like it slightly better than my previous favourite Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which produced this a month ago:



Transcribing audio

I had an MP3 lying around from a previous experiment which mixes English and Spanish. I tried running it with the prompt transcribe to see what would happen:


llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 &#x27;transcribe&#x27; \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3

I got back this, with timestamps interspersed with the text:


I need you [ 0m0s450ms ] to pretend [ 0m0s880ms ] to be [ 0m0s990ms ] a California [ 0m1s560ms ] brown [ 0m1s850ms ] pelican [ 0m2s320ms ] with [ 0m2s480ms ] a very [ 0m2s990ms ] thick [ 0m3s290ms ] Russian [ 0m3s710ms ] accent, [ 0m4s110ms ] but [ 0m4s540ms ] you [ 0m4s640ms ] talk [ 0m4s830ms ] to me [ 0m4s960ms ] exclusively [ 0m5s660ms ] in Spanish. [ 0m6s200ms ] Oye, [ 0m8s930ms ] camarada, [ 0m9s570ms ] aquí [ 0m10s240ms ] está [ 0m10s590ms ] tu [ 0m10s740ms ] pelícano [ 0m11s370ms ] californiano [ 0m12s320ms ] con [ 0m12s520ms ] acento [ 0m13s100ms ] ruso.

[ 0m20s414ms ] Mi [ 0m22s654ms ] día [ 0m22s934ms ] ha [ 0m23s4ms ] sido [ 0m23s464ms ] volando [ 0m24s204ms ] sobre [ 0m24s594ms ] las [ 0m24s844ms ] olas, [ 0m25s334ms ] buscando [ 0m26s264ms ] peces [ 0m26s954ms ] y [ 0m27s84ms ] disfrutando [ 0m28s14ms ] del [ 0m28s244ms ] sol [ 0m28s664ms ] californiano. [ 0m29s444ms ] Y [ 0m30s314ms ] tú, [ 0m30s614ms ] amigo, ¿ [ 0m31s354ms ] cómo [ 0m31s634ms ] ha [ 0m31s664ms ] estado [ 0m31s984ms ] tu [ 0m32s134ms ] día? [ 0m32s424ms ]


This inspired me to try again, this time including a JSON schema (using LLM&#x27;s custom schema DSL):


llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 &#x27;transcribe&#x27; \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3 \
  --schema-multi &#x27;timestamp str: mm:ss,text, language: two letter code&#x27;

I got an excellent response from that:


{
  &quot;items&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I need you to pretend to be a California brown pelican with a very thick Russian accent, but you talk to me exclusively in Spanish.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:00&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;es&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Oye, camarada. Aquí está tu pelícano californiano con acento ruso.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:08&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;es&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;¿Qué tal, Tovarish? ¿Listo para charlar en español?&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:13&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;How&#x27;s your day today?&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:19&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;es&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Mi día ha sido volando sobre las olas, buscando peces y disfrutando del sol californiano.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:22&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;es&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;¿Y tú, amigo, cómo ha estado tu día?&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:30&quot;
    }
  ]
}

I confirmed that the timestamps match the audio. This is fantastic.

Let&#x27;s try that against a ten minute snippet of a podcast episode I was on:


llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  &#x27;transcribe, first speaker is Christopher, second is Simon&#x27; \
  -a ten-minutes-of-podcast.mp3 \
  --schema-multi &#x27;timestamp str: mm:ss, text, speaker_name&#x27;

Useful LLM trick: you can use llm logs -c --data to get just the JSON data from the most recent prompt response, so I ran this:


llm logs -c --data | jq

Here&#x27;s the full output JSON, which starts and ends like this:


{
  &quot;items&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;speaker_name&quot;: &quot;Christopher&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;on its own and and it has this sort of like a it&#x27;s like a you know old tree in the forest, you know, kind of thing that you&#x27;ve built, so.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:00&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;speaker_name&quot;: &quot;Simon&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s also like I feel like with online writing, never ever like stick something online just expect people to find it. You have to So one of the great things about having a blog is I can be in a conversation about something and somebody ask a question, I can say, oh, I wrote about that two and a half years ago and give people a link.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;00:06&quot;
    },

    {
      &quot;speaker_name&quot;: &quot;Simon&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;So on that basis, Chat and I can&#x27;t remember if the free version of Chat GPT has code interpreter.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;09:45&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;speaker_name&quot;: &quot;Simon&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I hope I think it does.&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;09:50&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;speaker_name&quot;: &quot;Christopher&quot;,
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Okay. So this is like the basic paid one, maybe the $20 month because I know there&#x27;s like a $200 one that&#x27;s a little steep for like a basic&quot;,
      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;09:51&quot;
    }
  ]
}

A spot check of the timestamps showed them in the right place. Gemini 2.5 supports long context prompts so it&#x27;s possible this works well for much longer audio files - it would be interesting to dig deeper and try that out.

Bounding boxes

One of my favourite features of previous Gemini models is their support for bounding boxes: you can prompt them to return boxes around objects in images.

I built a separate tool for experimenting with this feature in August last year, which I described in Building a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in images. I&#x27;ve now upgraded that tool to add support the new model.

You can access it at tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox - you&#x27;ll need to provide your own Gemini API key which is sent directly to their API from your browser (it won&#x27;t be logged by an intermediary).

I tried it out on a challenging photograph of some pelicans... and it worked extremely well:

My prompt was:


Return bounding boxes around pelicans as JSON arrays [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]


The Gemini models are all trained to return bounding boxes scaled between 0 and 100. My tool knows how to convert those back to the same dimensions as the input image.

Here&#x27;s what the visualized result looked like:



It got almost all of them! I like how it didn&#x27;t draw a box around the one egret that had made it into the photo.

More characteristics of the model


Here&#x27;s the official model listing in the Gemini docs. Key details:


  
Input token limit: 1,000,000

  
Output token limit: 64,000 - this is a huge upgrade, all of the other listed models have 8,192 for this (correction: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking also had a 64,000 output length)

  
Knowledge cut-off: January 2025 - an improvement on Gemini 2.0&#x27;s August 2024



Gemini 2.5 Pro is a very strong new model

I&#x27;ve hardly scratched the surface when it comes to trying out Gemini 2.5 Pro so far. How&#x27;s its creative writing? Factual knowledge about the world? Can it write great code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and more?

The Gemini family of models have capabilities that set them apart from other models:


Long context length - Gemini 2.5 Pro supports up to 1 million tokens

Audio input - something which few other models support, certainly not at this length and with this level of timestamp accuracy

Accurate bounding box detection for image inputs


My experiments so far with these capabilities indicate that Gemini 2.5 Pro really is a very strong new model. I&#x27;m looking forward to exploring more of what it can do.


Update: it&#x27;s very good at code

I spent this evening trying it out for coding tasks, and it&#x27;s very, very impressive. I&#x27;m seeing results for Python that feel comparable to my previous favourite Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and appear to be benefitting from Gemini 2.5 Pro&#x27;s default reasoning mode and long context.

I&#x27;ve been wanting to add a new content type of &quot;notes&quot; to my blog for quite a while now, but I was put off by the anticipated tedium of all of the different places in the codebase that would need to be updated.

That feature is now live. Here are my notes on creating that notes feature using Gemini 2.5 Pro. It crunched through my entire codebase and figured out all of the places I needed to change - 18 files in total, as you can see in the resulting PR. The whole project took about 45 minutes from start to finish - averaging less than three minutes per file I had to modify.

I&#x27;ve thrown a whole bunch of other coding challenges at it, and the bottleneck on evaluating them has become my own mental capacity to review the resulting code!

Here&#x27;s another, more complex example. This hasn&#x27;t resulted in actual running code yet but it took a big bite out of an architectural design problem I&#x27;ve been stewing on for a very long time.


My LLM project needs support for tools - a way to teach different LLMs how to request tool execution, then have those tools (implemented in Python) run and return their results back to the models.


Designing this is really hard, because I need to create an abstraction that works across multiple different model providers, each powered by a different plugin.


Could Gemini 2.5 Pro help unblock me by proposing an architectural approach that might work?


I started by combining the Python and Markdown files for my sqlite-utils, llm, llm-gemini, and llm-anthropic repositories into one big document:


files-to-prompt sqlite-utils llm llm-gemini llm-anthropic -e md -e py -c

Piping it through ttok showed that to be 316,098 tokens (using the OpenAI tokenizer, but the Gemini tokenizer is likely a similar number).

Then I fed that all into Gemini 2.5 Pro with the following prompt:


Provide a detailed design proposal for adding tool calling support to LLM

Different model plugins will have different ways of executing tools, but LLM itself should provide both a Python and a CLI abstraction over these differences.

Tool calling involves passing tool definitions to a model, the model then replies with tools it would like executed, the harness code then executes those and passes the result back to the model and continues in a loop until the model stops requesting tools. This should happen as part of the existing llm.Conversation mechanism.

At the Python layer tools should be provided as Python functions that use type hints, which can then be converted into JSON schema using Pydantic - similar to how the existing schema&#x3D; mechanism works.

For the CLI option tools will be provided as an option passed to the command, similar to how the sqlite-utils convert CLI mechanism works.&#x27;


I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for over a year now. Gemini 2.5 Pro&#x27;s response isn&#x27;t exactly what I&#x27;m going to do, but it did include a flurry of genuinely useful suggestions to help me craft my final approach.

I hadn&#x27;t thought about the need for asyncio support for tool functions at all, so this idea from Gemini 2.5 Pro was very welcome:


The AsyncConversation.prompt() method will mirror the synchronous API, accepting the tools parameter and handling the tool calling loop using async/await for tool execution if the tool functions themselves are async. If tool functions are synchronous, they will be run in a thread pool executor via asyncio.to_thread.


Watching Gemini crunch through some of the more complex problems I&#x27;ve been dragging my heels on reminded me of something Harper Reed wrote about his   workflow with LLMs for code:


My hack to-do list is empty because I built everything. I keep thinking of new things and knocking them out while watching a movie or something.


I&#x27;ve been stressing quite a bit about my backlog of incomplete projects recently. I don&#x27;t think Gemini 2.5 Pro is quite going to work through all of them while I&#x27;m watching TV, but it does feel like it&#x27;s going to help make a significant dent in them.

                              <span>Today we’re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts. [...]
All other AI benchmarks focus on superhuman capabilities or specialized knowledge by testing &quot;PhD++&quot; skills. ARC-AGI is the only benchmark that takes the opposite design choice – by focusing on tasks that are relatively easy for humans, yet hard, or impossible, for AI, we shine a spotlight on capability gaps that do not spontaneously emerge from &quot;scaling up&quot;.

shot-scraper that makes it easier to share scripts for other people to use with the shot-scraper javascript command.
shot-scraper javascript lets you load up a web page in an invisible Chrome browser (via Playwright), execute some JavaScript against that page and output the results to your terminal. It&#x27;s a fun way of running complex screen-scraping routines as part of a terminal session, or even chained together with other commands using pipes.
The -i/--input option lets you load that JavaScript from a file on disk - but now you can also use a gh: prefix to specify loading code from GitHub instead.
To quote the release notes:
shot-scraper javascript can now optionally load scripts hosted on GitHub via the new gh: prefix to the shot-scraper javascript -i/--input option. #173
Scripts can be referenced as gh:username/repo/path/to/script.js or, if the GitHub user has created a dedicated shot-scraper-scripts repository and placed scripts in the root of it, using gh:username/name-of-script.
For example, to run this readability.js script against any web page you can use the following:
shot-scraper javascript --input gh:simonw/readability \
  https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/qwen25-vl-32b/

The output from that example starts like this:
{
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and Lighter&quot;,
    &quot;byline&quot;: &quot;Simon Willison&quot;,
    &quot;dir&quot;: null,
    &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en-gb&quot;,
    &quot;content&quot;: &quot;&lt;div id&#x3D;\&quot;readability-page-1\&quot;...


My simonw/shot-scraper-scripts repo only has that one file in it so far, but I&#x27;m looking forward to growing that collection and hopefully seeing other people create and share their own shot-scraper-scripts repos as well.
This feature is an imitation of a similar feature that&#x27;s coming in the next release of LLM.

Model Context Protocol) server wrapping Playwright, and it&#x27;s pretty fascinating.
They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.
Trying it out is quite easy if you have Claude Desktop and Node.js installed already. Edit your claude_desktop_config.json file:
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

And add this:
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;playwright&quot;: {
      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,
      &quot;args&quot;: [
        &quot;@playwright/mcp@latest&quot;
      ]
    }
  }
}


Now when you launch Claude Desktop various new browser automation tools will be available to it, and you can tell Claude to navigate to a website and interact with it.

I ran the following to get a list of the available tools:
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
cd playwright-mcp/src/tools
files-to-prompt . | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  &#x27;Output a detailed description of these tools&#x27;

The full output is here, but here&#x27;s the truncated tool list:

browser_navigate: Navigate to a specific URL
browser_go_back: Navigate back in browser history
browser_go_forward: Navigate forward in browser history
browser_wait: Wait for a specified time in seconds

DeepSeek v3-0324.
Qwen&#x27;s previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL, released in January in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.
Today&#x27;s Apache 2.0 licensed release is a 32B model, which is quickly becoming my personal favourite model size - large enough to have GPT-4-class capabilities, but small enough that on my 64GB Mac there&#x27;s still enough RAM for me to run other memory-hungry applications like Firefox and VS Code.
Qwen claim that the new model (when compared to their previous 2.5 VL family) can &quot;align more closely with human preferences&quot;, is better at &quot;mathematical reasoning&quot; and provides &quot;enhanced accuracy and detailed analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual logic deduction&quot;.
They also offer some presumably carefully selected benchmark results showing it out-performing Gemma 3-27B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B and GPT-4o-0513 (there have been two more recent GPT-4o releases since that one, 2024-08-16 and 2024-11-20).
As usual, Prince Canuma had MLX versions of the models live within hours of the release, in 4 bit, 6 bit, 8 bit, and bf16 variants.
I ran the 4bit version (a 18GB model download) using uv and Prince&#x27;s mlx-vlm like this:
uv run --with &#x27;numpy&lt;2&#x27; --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
    --max-tokens 1000 \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --prompt &quot;Describe this image.&quot; \
    --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png


Here&#x27;s the image:

And here&#x27;s the resulting description, which I found to be very impressive:
This image appears to be a map highlighting specific areas along the coastline, likely in California, based on the geographical features and place names. Here is a detailed description of the image:
Geographic Features:
The map shows a section of the coastline, with land on the right and the sea on the left.
The land area includes parts of SanMateo County, as noted in the top-right corner.
The coastline features several named locations, including:

Point Montara
Pillar Point
Kings Rock
VicenteCreek
DennistonCreek
State Beach
Highlighted Areas:
The map contains two distinct areas marked with different colors:


Red Area (Top Section)

Labeled as &quot;MONTARA&quot; and &quot;MONTARA M R&quot; (possibly referring to a &quot;Marine Reserves&quot; or similar protected area).
This area is marked with a dark red color and extends from the coastline inland.
Blue Area (Bottom Section)

Labeled as &quot;PILLAR&quot; and &quot;PILLAR P O I N T&quot; along with &quot;SMCA&quot; (Special Management Area).
This area is marked with a blue color and is located closer to the coastline, including the area around &quot;Pillar Point.&quot;
Depth Contours:
The map includes depth markings in the sea, indicating the bathymetrical features:


20 fathom (fm) line is marked in the upper-left part of the sea.
10 fathom (fm) line is marked closer to the coastline.
30 fathom (fm) line is marked further out to sea.
Other Features:
State Beach: Marked near the top-right, indicating a protected recreational area.
Kings Rock: A prominent feature near the coastline, likely a rocky outcropping.
Creeks: The map shows several creeks, including VicenteCreek and DennistonCreek, which flow into the sea.
Protected Areas:
The map highlights specific protected areas:


Marine Reserves:

&quot;MONTARA M R&quot; (Marine Reserves) in red.
Special Management Area (SMCA)

&quot;PILLAR P O I N T&quot; in blue, indicating a Special Management Area.
Grid and Coordinates:
The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude markings:

Latitude ranges from approximately 37°25&#x27;N to 37°35&#x27;N.
Longitude ranges from approximately 122°22.5&#x27;W to 122°35.5&#x27;W.
Topography:
The land area shows topographic features, including elevations and vegetation, with green areas indicating higher elevations or vegetated land.
Other Labels:
&quot;SMR&quot;: Likely stands for &quot;State Managed Reserves.&quot;
&quot;SMCA&quot;: Likely stands for &quot;Special Management Control Area.&quot;
In summary, this map highlights specific protected areas along the coastline, including a red &quot;Marine Reserves&quot; area and a blue &quot;Special Management Area&quot; near &quot;Pillar Point.&quot; The map also includes depth markings, geographical features, and place names, providing a detailed view of the region&#x27;s natural and protected areas.
It included the following runtime statistics:
Prompt: 1051 tokens, 111.985 tokens-per-sec
Generation: 760 tokens, 17.328 tokens-per-sec
Peak memory: 21.110 GB

DeepSeek-V3-0324.
The license is MIT (that&#x27;s new - previous DeepSeek v3 had a custom license), the README is empty and the release adds up a to a total of 641 GB of files, mostly of the form model-00035-of-000163.safetensors.
The model only came out a few hours ago and MLX developer Awni Hannun already has it running at &gt;20 tokens/second on a 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio ($9,499 of ostensibly consumer-grade hardware) via mlx-lm and this mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit 4bit quantization, which reduces the on-disk size to 352 GB.
I think that means if you have that machine you can run it with my llm-mlx plugin like this, but I&#x27;ve not tried myself!
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit

The new model is also listed on OpenRouter. You can try a chat at openrouter.ai/chat?models&#x3D;deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free.
Here&#x27;s what the chat interface gave me for &quot;Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle&quot;:

I have two API keys with OpenRouter - one of them worked with the model, the other gave me a No endpoints found matching your data policy error - I think because I had a setting on that key disallowing models from training on my activity. The key that worked was a free key with no attached billing credentials.
For my working API key the llm-openrouter plugin let me run a prompt like this:
llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste key here
llm -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free &quot;best fact about a pelican&quot;

Here&#x27;s that &quot;best fact&quot; - the terminal output included Markdown and an emoji combo, here that&#x27;s rendered.
One of the most fascinating facts about pelicans is their unique throat pouch, called a gular sac, which can hold up to 3 gallons (11 liters) of water—three times more than their stomach!  
Here’s why it’s amazing:
Fishing Tool: They use it like a net to scoop up fish, then drain the water before swallowing.
Cooling Mechanism: On hot days, pelicans flutter the pouch to stay cool by evaporating water.
Built-in &quot;Shopping Cart&quot;: Some species even use it to carry food back to their chicks.  
Bonus fact: Pelicans often fish cooperatively, herding fish into shallow water for an easy catch.  
Would you like more cool pelican facts? 🐦🌊
In putting this post together I got Claude to build me this new tool for finding the total on-disk size of a Hugging Face repository, which is available in their API but not currently displayed on their website.
Update: Here&#x27;s a notable independent benchmark from Paul Gauthier:
DeepSeek&#x27;s new V3 scored 55% on aider&#x27;s polyglot benchmark, significantly improving over the prior version. It&#x27;s the #2 non-thinking/reasoning model, behind only Sonnet 3.7. V3 is competitive with thinking models like R1 &amp; o3-mini.
