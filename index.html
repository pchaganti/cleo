I believe if he got re-elected in 1980, the US would be in a much better place.  One thing, it could be argued real work on Climate Change would have begun in 1981 as opposed to where we are now, which is just watching the average probably blowing past 3C in around 70 years from now.
For his loss in 1980, I still blame Kennedy.
RIP, he did a lot to help regular people through his life, far more than our current crop of politicians.</span>

                              <span>What I want is very simple: I want software that doesn&#x27;t send anything to the Internet without some explicit intent first. All of that work to try to make this feature plausibly private is cool engineering work, and there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with implementing a feature like this, but it should absolutely be opt-in.
Trust in software will continue to erode until software stops treating end users and their data and resources (e.g. network connections) as the vendor&#x27;s own playground. Local on-device data shouldn&#x27;t be leaking out of radio interfaces unexpectedly, period. There should be a user intent tied to any feature where local data is sent out to the network.
So why didn&#x27;t Apple just simply ask for user permission to enable this feature? My cynical opinion is because Apple knows some portion of users would instantly disallow this if prompted, but they feel they know better than those users. I don&#x27;t like this attitude, and I suspect it is the same reason why there is an increasing discontent growing towards opt-out telemetry, too.</span>

                              <span>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand most of the technical details of Apple&#x27;s blog post&quot;
I do:
- Client side vectorization: the photo is processed locally, preparing a non-reversible vector representation before sending (think semantic hash).
- Differential privacy: a decent amount of noise is added the the vector before sending it. Enough to make it impossible to reverse lookup the vector. The noise level here is ε &#x3D; 0.8, which is quite good privacy.
- OHTTP relay: it&#x27;s sent through a 3rd party so Apple never knows your IP address. The contents are encrypted so the 3rd party never doesn&#x27;t learn anything either (some risk of exposing &quot;IP X is an apple photos user&quot;, but nothing about the content of the library).
- Homomorphic encryption: The lookup work is performed on server with encrypted data. Apple can&#x27;t decrypt the vector contents, or response contents. Only the client can decrypt the result of the lookup.
This is what a good privacy story looks like. Multiple levels of privacy security, when any one of the latter 3 should be enough alone to protect privacy.
&quot;It ought to be up to the individual user to decide their own tolerance for the risk of privacy violations.&quot; -&gt; The author themselves looks to be an Apple security researcher, and are saying they can&#x27;t make an informed choice here.
I&#x27;m not sure what the right call is here. But the conclusion &quot;Thus, the only way to guarantee computing privacy is to not send data off the device.&quot; isn&#x27;t true. There are other tools to provide privacy (DP, homomorphic encryption), while also using services. They are immensely complicated, and user&#x27;s can&#x27;t realistically evaluate risk. But if you want features that require larger-than-disk datasets, or frequently changing content, you need tools like this.</span>

                              <span>Maybe not your company, but it seems hiring companies brought this upon themselves with immediate AI rejects of qualified candidates, ghost jobs, ghosting candidates after interview, etc, etc.
If it takes a qualified candidate 100&#x27;s of applications to land a single interview, then can you blame someone for automating it? I&#x27;d say that having the initiative and ability to automate it well would make this guy a great hire, if he hadn&#x27;t already found a job!</span>

                              <span>There are significant downsides to the digitalization of travel documents. The biggest one I can think of is ownership - the UK is moving to an entirely digital visa system and bringing in an ESTA style system called ETA for visa free countries. Unfortunately this means that residency cards for noncitizens are being phased out. This means that when the Home Office messes up and accidentally deletes your immigration status, or you are at an airport with no internet access, you have no evidence whatsoever of what status you hold. It also means you will no longer be in possession of any records that might be useful years in the future when the current database containing immigration records will likely have been replaced. It’s much easier to keep a piece of paper around for 30+ years than it is to make sure a digital record doesn’t rot in that time.
I feel strongly that any future digital travel credentials that are offered by governments should be able to operate entirely offline, and provide records that can be retained by the data subject. That means that revocation is harder, but IMO that’s a tradeoff that is worth making to avoid another Windrush scandal.
This has already become a pain when dealing with countries that don’t stamp passports, because when you need to apply for something that asks for your travel history over the past 10 years, you might not have any records anymore.</span>

                              <span>Coming from a Latin American the idea of re-starting your life across the country for college and then again for work (multiple times sometimes) while away from family and friends is very foreign.
A lot of the conversation around modern American youth feeling isolated, lacking socialization and not building strong relationships seems that stem from this drive.
Another thing that’s really weird and related is another recurring theme in the American ethos: the cultural shame that comes with living “at home” or staying in the same small town for your whole life. Somehow they made it so living close to your family and friends for your 20s-30s  and maybe forever means you’re a “loser”.</span>

                              <span>Civil discourse is preferable to the alternatives of coerced silence and violence. Coerced silence means that one side has exercised power to end conversation—to say, in effect, there is no point in further discussion; be quiet and accept that our desires will prevail. Violence means that reason has failed and we are reduced to the condition of resolving disputes by means of fang and claw, rock and club, bullet and bomb. More

Ultimately, the shooting was only revealed by the New York City DA&#x27;s office.

                              <span>Donald Trump and the Marlboro Man are case studies of branding success. When Philip Morris introduced the cowboy on its ads in 1955, sales were at $5 billion. Two years later, sales were at $20 billion. Ellen Merlo, the vice president of marketing services at Philip Morris, described the cowboy image as “very rugged, individualistic, heroic.” Rugged and individualistic is exactly the image Trump tries to portray. Why else go to WWE Raw events or a college football game? How else to describe his raised fist cry “Fight, fight, fight,” when struck by a bullet during an assassination attempt. Trump’s mythological image has helped him to be re-elected president despite (because of) twice being impeached and convicted of 34 felony accounts. The Marlboro Man and Trump’s image portrayal are fundamental to the American mythology of the pioneer spirit exploring new frontiers which now includes the popular success of tech start-up heroes like Elon Musk.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about the notion of &quot;reasoning locally&quot; recently. Enabling local reasoning is the only way to scale software development past some number of lines or complexity. When reasoning locally, one only needs to understand a small subset, hundreds of lines, to safely make changes in programs comprising millions.
I find types helps massively with this. A function with well-constrained inputs and outputs is easy to reason about. One does not have to look at other code to do it. However, programs that leverage types effectively are sometimes construed as having high cognitive load, when it in fact they have low load. For example a type like &#x60;Option&gt;&#x60; carries a lot of information(has low load): we might not have a set of user ids, but if we do they are unique.
The discourse around small functions and the clean code guidelines is fascinating. The complaint is usually, as in this post, that having to go read all the small functions adds cognitive load and makes reading the code harder. Proponents of small functions argue that you don&#x27;t have to read more than the signature and name of a function to understand what it does; it&#x27;s obvious what a function called last that takes a list and returns an optional value does. If someone feels compelled to read every function either the functions are poor abstractions or the reader has trust issues, which may be warranted. Of course, all abstractions are leaky, but perhaps some initial trust in &#x60;last&#x60; is warranted.</span>

                              <span>Christmas of 1981 in Athens, Greece. I was 15. Father had died 3 years ago from heart attack at 42. His last words to my mother: &quot;Educate the kids&quot;.
She did her best, given that my grandfather was old fashioned and had stopped her from going to school after she became twelve, although she was among the smartest in her class.
That Christmas she had bought me the brand new then Sinclair ZX81 personal computer. We were visiting the grandparents in a small village near Athens.
I spend the night by the fireplace with a small portable TV and the machine, typing in games published in the UK PC magazines of that time and occasionally watching the Chrstmas shows. Debugging my typos was the way I learned how programming works.
Nothing really interesting here, but I am remembering that night again and again so when I saw the prompt I felt I should share. Merry Christmas everyone.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m Jewish, so all my Christmas&#x27;s growing up were kinda the same.  Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor&#x27;s house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys.  Sometimes we&#x27;d go out for Chinese food and a movie.
But my favorite was Christmas 1999.  My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too).  I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville.
I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon.  The timing lined up perfectly to see all three.  About 50 other people were there to do the same thing.  When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late.  This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies.
About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off.  Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies.
That was a great day.</span>

                              <span>- No serious hedge funds or other activists involved in this, ie no adults involved, check
- Fully audited financials not being questioned, check
- CEO and CFO constantly acknowledging the Foundary unit wasn&#x27;t profitable in quarterly updates, check.
The former CEO was brought in to to try and keep Intel a fully integrated business that designed and manufactured chips.  He was very clear upfront about his plan to not divest the foundry and instead to try and build it back up.
It didn&#x27;t&#x27; work, that&#x27;s not a crime.  He left because his plan didn&#x27;t work.  That&#x27;s what happens to CEO&#x27;s who try and fail to implement a business plan.
This is just an ambulance chaser lawsuit that doesn&#x27;t look like it will go anywhere at all.
If there was any merit at all then the board would also be involved in going after the former CEO and CFO.</span>

                              <span>This question reminds me of the first time I met a blind programmer.
I asked him how he managed to code, and he replied with something that stayed with me: a good programmer should organize software in such a way that every piece of code has a clear and logical place. The organization should be so intuitive that anyone could build a mental model of the structure and navigate it easily, even without seeing it.
It felt like something out of a Yoda or Mr. Miyagi lesson. Skeptical, I asked his colleagues if he was truly able to code or if he was just exaggerating. To my surprise, they told me not only was he capable, but he was the best programmer they had ever worked with. They said no one else came close to writing code as organized as his.
That conversation changed my perspective. Ever since, whenever I’m unsure where to place new code, I don’t think about DDD or any specific methodology. Instead, I try to follow the logic and structure of the project in a way that feels natural and easy to follow later.
Later in life, I met two other blind programmers and heard similar stories about their ability to produce well-organized code.
To bring this back to the original question: I view LSP/IDE features the same way those programmers view &quot;visual aids.&quot; Code should be organized according to a clear and logical structure that makes it easy to navigate.
Relying on features like Ctrl+Click to find where things are located worries me. Why? Because it can mask structural flaws in the codebase. If we can&#x27;t intuitively figure out where something belongs, that’s a sign the codebase lacks structure—and that should motivate us to refactor it.
Not only do I avoid using LSP features, but I’m also opposed to their use. While they can help with navigation, they may prevent developers from experiencing and addressing the underlying structural issues in their code.</span>

These longer cycles or waves last around 50-60 years including the (...)
