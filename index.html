                              <span>One of the reasons I’m having difficulty “enjoying the holidays” is the editorial writing of Bret Stephens.  His columns defending Israel’s brutal military campaign that targets sanctuary areas and so-called safe zones in Gaza are typically chauvinistic and bellicose.  Stephens supports any Israeli military option that “advances Israel’s national interests on all fronts.”  His lecture at Harvard last year argued that “taking out most, but not all, of Hamas is not enough,” which seems to justify the genocidal campaign that Israel conducts.  Stephens has never mentioned that this campaign targets Gaza’s hospitals and health infrastructure.  As for those who protest Israeli actions, Stephens calls them “Iran’s useful idiots” and anti-semites.

In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I&#x27;m not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It&#x27;s a way of taking back control.
When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I&#x27;ve nurtured...a lot more than what I&#x27;ve built, in most ways. I&#x27;ve heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like &quot;I now enjoy making other people rich.&quot;
No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.</span>

I think his problem is his identity (founder of Loom) suddenly disappeared.
Now he needs to develop a new identity.
This is especially difficult for single founders without kids (in the sense that people with spouse/kids already derive much of their identity from those 2 things).

                              <span>&gt; The &quot;unsubscribe&quot; button in Indeed&#x27;s job notification emails leads me to an impassable Cloudflare challenge.
That&#x27;s a CAN-SPAM act violation.
FTC: &quot;Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.&quot;[1]
Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.
The actual regulation text:
§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.
Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient&#x27;s electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:
(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or
(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).
That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.

                              <span>In 2005, my paper on breaking RSA by observing a single private-key operation from a different hyperthread sharing the same L1 cache -- literally the first publication of a cryptographic attack exploiting shared caches -- was rejected from the cryptology preprint archive on the grounds that &quot;it was about CPU architecture, not cryptography&quot;.  Rejection from journals is like rejection from VCs -- it happens all the time and often not for any good reason.
(That paper has now been cited 971 times according to Google Scholar, despite never appearing in a journal.)</span>

                              <span>Hilarious irony:
&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an &quot;epsilon loss&quot; in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.
&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!</span>

                              <span>&gt; Credit card delinquency rates, which are seen as a precursor to write-offs, peaked in July, according to data from Moody’s, but have only fallen slightly and remain nearly a percentage point higher than they were on average in the year before the pandemic.
This is a prime example of a style of reporting that really grinds my gears.
The citation is clearly to another internet source, so a link should be provided. If it truly cannot be linked because it is private, more context is still needed to understand what this data means.
I actually can’t find the source myself, but I can find “Delinquency Rate on Credit Card Loans, All Commercial Banks” from the Federal Reserve. [1]
The percents from that source somewhat match those referenced in the FT quote. “Peaked in July”
- 2024Q1 3.15%
- 2024Q2 3.24%
- 2024Q3 3.23%
Using 2019 as “the year before the pandemic”, the average was 2.5825. Is +0.6475 “nearly a percentage point”? I guess it technically would round up.
Seemingly important context that the quote doesn’t give is that 3.23% is lower than any time 1991Q3 to 2011Q4. But, maybe the trend matters more for this metric.

                              <span>I worked with John for a few years in the 1990s. This was during the heyday of BBSes, when he joined our small team at Mustang Software after Mustang bought Qmodem. John moved to Bakersfield California (with his family, including OP!) to be with us. John left a few years later due to I think business differences with management.
John was personable and full of joy. He always loved a good joke. I remember the parties (not wild, we were pretty tame back then) we would have around the pool at his place. He was generous with his time.
The story of Qmodem itself was a bit different. Qmodem for DOS was a one-man shareware business and was John&#x27;s pride and joy. It was clear that he poured everything into that program. It was finely tuned and just worked. Times were changing though, and people were calling for a Windows version. Unfortunately, John was not interested in learning Windows programming, so Scott Hunter (now at Microsoft), Dan Horn, and I built Qmodem for Windows. It was good, but it really never had the same level of polish that John&#x27;s work did. It was &quot;Qmodem&quot; in name only.
After John left Mustang he also left Bakersfield and I lost touch with him. I&#x27;m sure he continued to make the people around him smile. Thank you for your time and contributions, John.</span>

                              <span>Cool :) I&#x27;m a co-author on this. AMA.
This is now a peer-reviewed paper, published last month in Cell [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01091-2].
Obelisks are part of a larger research program we&#x27;re developing at the University of Toronto + collaborators, see also: Virus-Viroid Hybrids paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38301-2] and the Zeta-Elements [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04332-2].
Computational biology is driving a revolutionary expansion of our understanding of Earth&#x27;s biodiversity. I believe Zeta-elements, Ambiviruses, and Obelisks are just the beginning. If you&#x27;re interested, our &quot;Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms&quot; (University of Toronto) is hiring passionate developers/post-docs/graduate students [https://www.rnalab.ca].
Edit: OK going to call it for now. I&#x27;ll check in later today if there&#x27;s any outstanding questions.</span>

                              <span>&gt; SQLite is not open source in the legal sense, as “open source” has a specific definition and requires licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
This is wrong, and harmfully wrong. OSI are not the arbiters of open source. Their Open Source Definition, though generally useful and accepted, is not without legitimate criticism and controversy. As for their approval, that’s a dreadful thing to rely on for any purpose; https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/05/05/Rely-on-OSI.html&gt; is a good description of most of what’s wrong with it (it doesn’t really get into the broken politics enough; but some of his other articles contain more), and I like its summary: “The list of OSI-approved licenses reflects OSI’s practical and political history, not any useful, consistently functional category of license terms.”
As for whether SQLite is open source, well, the only reason a public domain dedication doesn’t meet the OSD is that it’s not a license. It’s more open. In a way that is legally mildly uncertain in some jurisdictions, sure, but to call it “not open source in the legal sense” is just wrong.</span>
