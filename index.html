                              <span>In July 2024, the World Bank and the IMF will be 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough!

In recent years, I’ve been focused on promoting diplomacy over war and exposing the role of giant weapons companies like Lockheed Martin and its allies in Congress and at the Pentagon as they push for a “military-first” foreign policy. I’ve worked at an alphabet soup of think tanks: the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), the World Policy Institute (WPI), the New America Foundation, the Center for International Policy (CIP), and my current institutional home, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft (QI).

If we could get most people using electric vehicles, and have the energy coming from clean sources, we could radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem was […]</span>

                              <span>I skimmed through the article but didn’t find mention of one glaring deficiency in iPadOS — it still doesn’t support multiple users and multiuser switching, even though the hardware is capable of it (and exceeds the capacity of many Macs before it). I decided several years ago that I’m not buying another iPad until this is sorted out by iPadOS.
I think of iPhones as personal devices, where each person may have their own. But iPads are more likely to be shared for personal use in families. The fact that each person using it cannot have their own user profiles, app data, etc., is a huge drawback. Apple has supported this for a long time (though probably not in the best way) for education, but it’s not available to others. Even tvOS supports switching between user profiles quickly.
Apple enforcing the idea that iPad (with iPadOS) should also be a personal device — one device per person — makes the user experience quite poor.</span>

                              <span>A Google search for practically any long-tail keywords will reveal that LLMs have already had a very significant impact. DuckDuckGo has suffered even more. Social media is absolutely lousy with AI-powered fraud of varying degrees of sophistication.
It&#x27;s glib to dismiss safety concerns because we haven&#x27;t all turned into paperclips yet. LLMs and image gen models are having real effects now.
We&#x27;re already at a point where AI can generate text and images that will fool a lot of people a lot of the time. For every college-educated young person smugly pointing out that they aren&#x27;t fooled by an image with six-fingered hands, there are far more people who had marginal media literacy to begin with and are now almost defenceless against a tidal wave of hyper-scaleable deception.
We&#x27;re already at a point where we&#x27;re counselling elders to ignore late-night messages from people claiming to be a relative in need of an urgent wire transfer. What defences do we have when an LLM will be able to have a completely fluent, natural-sounding conversation in someone else&#x27;s voice? I&#x27;m not confident that I&#x27;d be able to distinguish GPT-4o from a human speaker in the best of circumstances and I&#x27;m almost certain that I could be fooled if I&#x27;m hurried, distracted, sleep deprived or otherwise impaired.
Regardless of any future impacts on the labour market or any hypothesised X-risks, I think we should be very worried about the immediate risks to trust and social cohesion. An awful lot of people are turning into paranoid weirdos at the moment and I don&#x27;t particularly blame them, but I can see things getting seriously ugly if we can&#x27;t abate that trend.</span>

After an OpenAI launch, I think it&#x27;s important to take one&#x27;s feelings about the future impact of the technology with a HUGE grain of salt. OpenAI are masters of hype. They have been generating hype for years now, yet the real-world impacts remain modest so far.
Do you remember when they teased GPT-2 as &quot;too dangerous&quot; for public access? I do. Yet we now have Llama 3 in the wild, which even at the smaller 8B size is about as powerful as the [edit: 6/13/23] GPT-4 release.
As someone pointed out elsewhere in the comments, a logistic curve looks exponential in the beginning, before it approaches saturation. Yet, logistic curves are more common, especially in ML. I think it&#x27;s interesting that GPT-4o doesn&#x27;t show much of an improvement in &quot;reasoning&quot; strength.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s 2 genders, right? We all know that.
Of course there is. You&#x27;re either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you&#x27;re a woman without said dangly bits.
But maybe there&#x27;s more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn&#x27;t feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it&#x27;s the opposite? Or something in between?
Honestly, I don&#x27;t give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I&#x27;ll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.
Look, it&#x27;s a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We&#x27;ve been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there&#x27;s been 2 genders. Male and female.
But in the last few decades there&#x27;s been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as &quot;him&quot; don&#x27;t get up on your high horse and start screaming &quot;YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!&quot;
I assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that&#x27;s fine. Tell me politely and I&#x27;ll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.
Irony is, if you&#x27;re not a dick about the whole thing, you&#x27;re far more likely to get people on-side. You&#x27;re always gonna get bigoted wankers, that&#x27;s par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn&#x27;t make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.
It just makes them human.

It&#x27;s an eighteen-page oneshot and my very first contribution to an anthology, which is honestly very exciting. Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.
Working on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don&#x27;t like inking, I half-ass shapes I don&#x27;t understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don&#x27;t really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing.

                              <span>My throat hurts a little. I don’t know if this is because of the air quality here or because I’m actually getting sick, but I’m desperately hoping it’s not the latter. I stopped taking my immunosuppressants today and started drinking lots of juices high in vitamin C, despite research proving chugging OJ a rather ineffective method for warding off illness. (Something about all the sugar in it makes it hard for your body to absorb the Vitamin C, if I remember correctly.)
Traveling and getting sick go hand in hand for me. It’s as if arriving somewhere new triggers my immune system to self-immolate. When I visited New York in 2021 I lost my voice after a few days. I spent my first week in Latin America making chicken noodle soup and nursing myself back to health. My immune system’s never been …</span>

                              <span>I never really thought about it while growing up because I was raised in a religious family anyway and it&#x27;s just how I was used to people talking, but at this point I&#x27;ve been living in Japan for several years and I often notice that very normal phrases take on a religious persona when translated to English. For example we have this word yokatta which literally translates as &quot;it was good&quot;, but if you were to translate it normally to English as it&#x27;s used than it would come out as &quot;thank God&quot;. Or we have this other word kotoka which would be translated as &quot;God knows&quot; like &quot;God only knows how bored I am&quot; (なんて暇なことか). Also a lot of words in English are shortened versions of old phrases with religious significance like &quot;Goodbye&quot; coming from &quot;God be with ye&quot;, and a lot of set phrases or common expressions in English that people use all the time come straight from the Bible like &quot;a drop in the bucket&quot;, &quot;go the extra mile&quot;, &quot;by the skin of your teeth&quot;, &quot;the root of the matter&quot;, &quot;a labor of love&quot;, &quot;scapegoat&quot;, &quot;broken heart&quot;, &quot;eye for an eye&quot;, &quot;rise and shine&quot;, &quot;fall by the wayside&quot;, or &quot;a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;
I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a bad thing (and I don&#x27;t think it is), and Japanese has a lot of similar words or phrases which come from a religious origin too. It&#x27;s just kinda weird to notice in retrospect how in English-speaking countries everything is experienced through a Judeo-Christian lens, even if you&#x27;re an atheist.
Maybe that&#x27;s why Western society and Japanese society are so different. Or partly why, anyway.</span>

i try not to dredge up the past but looking back, it&#x27;s not that the issue was a matter of effort. sudden losses in the family and a general fear anyone else i cared about would fall ill aggravated a condition i was largely unaware of into rearing its big, ugly head. those days i&#x27;d lived not knowing 120 bpm was my resting average. and then the waitlists. and the forced leaves. and the absurd changes to curriculum. 

hard not to fault myself for ignoring my health. i mean, i was and still am obsessed with seeming invincible. who else was supposed to notice something was wrong? but at the very least, i probably would have graduated on time had the world not been actively folding in o…</span>

                              <span>This morning, the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit for the first quarter of 2024. Household debt balances grew by $184 billion over the previous quarter, slightly less than the moderate growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. Housing debt balances grew by $206 billion. Auto loans saw a $9 billion increase, continuing their steady growth since the second quarter of 2020, while balances on other non-housing debts fell. Credit card balances fell by $14 billion, which is typical for the first quarter. However, an increasing number of borrowers are behind on credit card payments. In this post, we explore the relationship between credit card delinquency and changes in credit card “utilization rates.”</span>

                              <span>This is a very cool demo - if you dig deeper there’s a clip of them having a “blind” AI talk to another AI with live camera input to ask it to explain what it’s seeing. Then they, together, sing a song about what they’re looking at, alternating each line, and rhyming with one another. Given all of the isolated capabilities of AI, this isn’t particularly surprising, but seeing it all work together in real time is pretty incredible.
But it’s not scary. It’s… marvelous, cringey, uncomfortable, awe-inspiring. What’s scary is not what AI can currently do, but what we expect from it. Can it do math yet? Can it play chess? Can it write entire apps from scratch? Can it just do my entire job for me?
We’re moving toward a world where every job will be modeled, and you’ll either be an AI owner, a model architect, an agent/hardware engineer, a technician, or just.. training data.</span>

                              <span>I worry that this tech will amplify the cultural values we have of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; emotions way more than the default restrictions that social media platforms put on the emoji reactions (e.g., can&#x27;t be angry on LinkedIn).
I worry that the AI will not express anger, not express sadness, not express frustration, not express uncertainty, and many other emotions that the culture of the fine-tuners might believe are &quot;bad&quot; emotions and that we may express a more and more narrow range of emotions going forward.
Almost like it might become an AI &quot;yes man.&quot;</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had voice input and voice output with computers for a long time, but it&#x27;s never felt like spoken conversation. At best it&#x27;s a series of separate voice notes. It feels more like texting than talking.
These demos show people talking to artificial intelligence. This is new. Humans are more partial to talking than writing. When people talk to each other (in person or over low-latency audio) there&#x27;s a rich metadata channel of tone and timing, subtext, inexplicit knowledge. These videos seem to show the AI using this kind of metadata, in both input and output, and the conversation even flows reasonably well at times. I think this changes things a lot.</span>

                              <span>I wanted to create a voice assistant that is completely offline and doesn&#x27;t require any internet connection. This is because I wanted to ensure that the user&#x27;s privacy is protected and that the user&#x27;s data is not being sent to any third party servers.
Props, and thank you for this.</span>

Because its capacities are focused on exactly the right place to feel magical. Which isn’t to say that there isn’t real utility, but language (written, and even moreso spoken) has an enormous emotional resonance for humans, so this is laser-targeted in an area where every advance is going to “feel magical” whether or not it moves the needle much on practical utility; it’s not unlike the effect of TV news making you feel informed, even though time spent watching it negatively correlates with understanding of current events.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m ceaselessly amazed at people&#x27;s capacity for impatience. I mean, when GPT 4 came out, I was like &quot;holy f, this is magic!!&quot; How quickly we get used to that magic and demand more.
Especially since this demo is extremely impressive given the voice capabilities, yet still the reaction is, essentially, &quot;But what about AGI??!!&quot; Seriously, take a breather. Never before in my entire career have I seen technology advance at such a breakneck speed - don&#x27;t forget transformers were only invented 7 years ago. So yes, there will be some ups and downs, but I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at the thought that &quot;14 months&quot; is seen as a long time...</span>

                              <span>I think the live demo that happened on the livestream is best to get a feel for this model[0].
I don&#x27;t really care whether it&#x27;s stronger than gpt-4-turbo or not. The direct real-time video and audio capabilities are absolutely magical and stunning. The responses in voice mode are now instantaneous, you can interrupt the model, you can talk to it while showing it a video, and it understands (and uses) intonation and emotion.
Really, just watch the live demo. I linked directly to where it starts.
Importantly, this makes the interaction a lot more &quot;human-like&quot;.

                              <span>The usual critics will quickly point out that LLMs like GPT-4o still have a lot of failure modes and suffer from issues that remain unresolved. They will point out that we&#x27;re reaping diminishing returns from Transformers. They will question the absence of a &quot;GPT-5&quot; model. And so on -- blah, blah, blah, stochastic parrots, blah, blah, blah.
Ignore the critics. Watch the demos. Play with it.
This stuff feels magical. Magical. It makes the movie &quot;Her&quot; look like it&#x27;s no longer in the realm of science fiction but in the realm of incremental product development. HAL&#x27;s unemotional monotone in Kubrick&#x27;s movie, &quot;Space Odyssey,&quot; feels... oddly primitive by comparison. I&#x27;m impressed at how well this works.
Well-deserved congratulations to everyone at OpenAI!</span>

                              <span>They are admitting[1] that the new model is the gpt2-chatbot that we have seen before[2]. As many highlighted there, the model is not an improvement like GPT3-&gt;GPT4. I tested a bunch of programming stuff and it was not that much better.
It&#x27;s interesting that OpenAI is highlighting the Elo score instead of showing results for many many benchmarks that all models are stuck at 50-70% success.

                              <span>It brings to mind the story of how when Boris Yeltsin was visiting the US, he took an impromptu detour to a random American supermarket to try to catch them off guard, only to be blown away that Americans really did have supermarkets everywhere practically overflowing with food. The story goes that the experience played a big role in shaping his vision for Russia when he went on to become its first freely elected leader a few years later.

Or similarly there&#x27;s the story of the Lykov family, who lived life cut off from humanity for 40 years but still somewhat understood what the new, moving &quot;stars&quot; in the night sky must be: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/for-40-years-this-rus...

                              <span>Years ago, over a decade ago now, I was a .Net developer. Microsoft introduced Entity Framework, their new way of handling data in .Net applications. Promises made, promises believed, we all used it. I was especially glad of Lazy Loading, where I didn&#x27;t have to load data from the database into my memory structures; the system would do that automatically. I could write my code as if all my memory structures were populated and not worry about it. Except, it didn&#x27;t work consistently. Every now and again a memory structure would not be populated, for no apparent reason. Digging deep into technet, I found a small note saying &quot;if this happens, then you can check whether the data has been loaded by checking the value of this flag and manually loading it if necessary&quot; [0]. So, in other words, I have to manually load all my data because I can&#x27;t trust EF to do it for me. [1]
Long analogy short, this is where I think AI for coding is now. It gets things wrong enough that I have to manually check everything it does and correct it, to the point where I might as well just do it myself in the first place. This might not always be the case, but that&#x27;s where I feel it is right now.
[0] Entity Framework has moved on a lot since then, and apparently now can be trusted to lazily load data. I don&#x27;t know because...
[1] I spat the dummy, replaced Windows with Linux, and started learning Go. Which does exactly what it says it does, with no magic. Exactly what I needed, and I still love Go for this.</span>

Like many of you, I have always been a gamer and have spent tens of thousands of hours exploring in-game worlds. These days, I&#x27;m too busy with my full-time job (helping people build interesting products using blockchains) to play much, and I tend to spend more time consuming content about games than playing them. I barely ever beat/100% a game like I used to. I still find myself driven to the aura that surrounds a game, often comprising of lore, community, roleplaying, extensive multi-party discussion and the creation of adjacent media.
I understand that this opening statement might be controversial, but I have seen enough of the behind-the-scenes of web3 gaming (or its name-of-the-month; I&#x27;m glad we dropp…</span>

The way I do it is more intimate. I am a low-level programmer. I write firmware code in c mostly. I think about the hardware that runs my code more than the average programmer. Yet if it was the 1980&#x27;s I would be a very high-level programmer. The assembly lang bros will look at me with contempt the same way I look at the python bros. The thought alone makes me shiver.
How we talk to computers has evolved. So many great engineers built the infrastructure that I use today to turn my c code into machine code. From the libraries, the operating system, and the compiler. There is a sort of deterministic heuristic-based intelligence b…</span>

                              <span>i know, kind of random. 

these days, kids in the region where i live get chromebooks at school. 

many of my students, including the ones who are now in middle school, are not efficient typers, and in fact many of them are slamming their pointer fingers down on keys one by one, the younger ones not even remembering where any of the letters are even after countless repetitions of the same words. 

and don&#x27;t even get me started on their spelling skills. 
choice, import, and scissors, although i&#x27;ll cut some of the younger ones slack on scissors. 

something else i find pretty funny is that occasionally they&#x27;ll try to touch the screen on the desktop to navigate. 

and this is all coming from an area where many of the school districts are top in the nation. 

did you also know that kids nowadays are more susceptible to online scams and malware? 

and overall, kids throughout the nation are reading at a significantly lower level than they should be, even with schooling. 

that&#x27;s it from me, thanks for reading my rant:)</span>

                              <span>There is nothing in this world that is easy. Everything requires a process, long or short, to get where we are today.
Allow me to name few things:
The ability to stand on both of your legs was the result of the development from crawling to standing
The ability to write and type is a result of constant practice and repeats
The ability to count is the result of constant effort to understand numbers
Nothing is easy, everything requires time and effort. We simply took granted for the simple things that have shaped us to be who we are today.</span>

                              <span>Today we had the big family reunion I’ve been waiting for all these years. My mom’s older sister came with her husband, as did my mom’s uncle (my grandma’s little brother).
My late uncle’s wife and daughter (my cousin) kindly joined us too. I mentioned how much I wanted to see my cousin in an earlier post. When we went to my uncle’s apartment with strawberries in hand to visit her I felt bad seeing the eye bags and stress lines written all over their face. In spite of all that, they invited us in and told us their side of the story while shedding tears. The details of his precipitously declining health and death were gruesome; I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying. I can’t imagine the whirlwind of emotions the last month has been for them.
That said, I was still really glad to see my…</span>

Almost two weeks ago, I wrote about catching a crawfish in the pond near Jiaozi Park, not far from where I live. My wife and I weren&#x27;t sure what to do - whether we should put it back or keep it. Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.
I&#x27;m happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We&#x27;ve noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It&#x27;s no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we&#x27;re nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.
We&#x27;re trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well. I&#x27;ll provide more updates as things progress.</span>

                              <span>A few months ago there were articles going around about how Samsung galaxy phones were upscaling images of the Moon using AI [0]. Essentially, the model was artificially adding landmarks and details based on its training set when the real image quality was too poor to make out details.
Needless to say, AI upscaling as described in this article would be a nightmare for radiologists. 90% of radiology is confirming the absence of disease when image quality is high, and asking for complementary studies when image quality is low. With AI enhanced images that look &quot;normal&quot;, how can the radiologist ever say &quot;I can confirm there is no brain bleed&quot; when the computer might be incorrectly adding &quot;normal&quot; details when compensating for poor image quality?

                              <span>Grandpa picks up my spiral notebook filled with loopy scribbles, and I don’t stop him because I know he can’t read what I write anyway. He compliments my handwriting, which makes me feel a pang of guilt. Am I being ungrateful, spoiled when I write about my experience like this?
There is not a whole lot to do here. With my uncle gone there’s no one to take us out; while healthy, my grandparents can’t walk for very long and neither can my mom. My brother and I are useless on our own. We don’t have a data plan, can’t pay for anything because we don’t have WeChat pay set up (I think you need a Chinese bank account), and can’t even download an offline map to help us get around. If we do go out on our own we’ll have to retrace our steps by memory.

                              <span>In the morning vendors sell wares out of cargo bicycles and vans along the main road. There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.
If I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides. Mom says my uncle was hit by a car in similar circumstances, which makes me jumpy. I try to give the vehicles weaving around us a wide berth, bu…</span>

                              <span>A gold Volkswagen Jetta with no seatbelts picks us up from the airport. Our driver talks to Mom in thick accent, slurring syllables together in bunches. There are many words I can’t catch, but the lilting rhythm falls comfortably on my ears.
I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

                              <span>A running list of things that have had a big impact on me :
Hank and John Green: Nerdfighteria is my internet home.
WaitButWhy: Deep dives into topics from first principles and cool sticky figures. Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.
Brandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.
Staring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.
LessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.
Richard Feynman&#x27;s Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…</span>
