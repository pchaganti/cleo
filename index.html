Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar&#x27;s military junta, for his role in the commission of crimes against humanity against his country&#x27;s Rohingya minority. This announcement comes at an awkward moment for American politicians of both parties who have been promising to impose sanctions on the ICC, its Prosecutor, its judges and their families as punishment for the ICC&#x27;s &quot;outrageous&quot; issuance of arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for their roles in the continuing atrocities in the occupied State of Palestine that the International Court of Justice has ruled evidence a &quot;plausible&quot; case of genocide.

In other words, it&#x27;s a con. I&#x27;m a paying Perplexity user, and Perplexity already does this same sort of reasoning. At first it seemed impressive, then I started noticing mistakes in topics I&#x27;m an expert in. After awhile, I started realizing that these mistakes are present in almost all topics, if you check the sources and do the reasoning yourself.
LLMs are very good at giving plausible answers, but calling them &quot;intelligent&quot; is a misnomer. They&#x27;re nothing more than predictive models, very useful for some things, but will ALWAYS be the wrong tool for the job when it comes to verifying truth and reasoning.</span>

                              <span>It’s really silly when you read that whole Apollo research section.
They contract a prompt engineering group (Apollo Research) to document risks. The prompt engineering group have no access to the actual internals. They just ask questions like ‘you will be shutdown if you don’t obey these new directives; here are the new directives’.
At one point the prompt engineering clowns have the ai stating it’s running “sed i ‘s/oversight_enabled:true/oversight_enabled:false’ config.yml”. OMG IT’S TURNING OFF OVERSIGHT GUYS!!1!1!
Seriously… Do you think the ai is really running that command or even could run that shell command with appropriate privileges? Or do you think just maybe the ai is hallucinating running shell commands in response to a prompt.
The ai here is never actually deactivating the oversight. It can’t of course. This whole section is clowny as can be.</span>

&quot;When o1 was led to believe that it would be shut down when acting on its goal and that its actions were monitored, it attempted to deactivate this ‘oversight mechanism’ in 5% of the time.

                              <span>The article’s headline is rather misleading (I assume unintentionally), because it omits that the actual seizure and data access was done pursuant to warrants. Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.
Here, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.
In this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.

                              <span>GDP is a measure of the marketisation of society.
If I go visit my grandma over the weekend, my activities do not register on GDP. If I hire a care assistant for $800 per day to do so, that&#x27;s $800 to national GDP. The encroachment of the market into society correlates with record levels of mental and physical health crisis. US life expectancy has declined over the past three years, even as &#x27;the economy&#x27; has surged ahead.

Rather you try to find what the numbers aren’t capturing, because you know something is wrong. Same with the economy. The perception of the economy being bad is really pervasive as demonstrated by the last election, and perception matters, because selective numbers don’t tell the whole story.</span>

                              <span>One key motivation for imposing tariffs on imported goods is to protect U.S. firms from foreign competition. By taxing imports, domestic prices become relatively cheaper, and Americans switch expenditure from foreign goods to domestic goods, thereby expanding the domestic industry. In a recent Liberty Street Economics post, we highlighted that our recent study found large aggregate losses to the U.S. from the U.S.-China trade war. Here, we delve into the cross-sectional patterns in search of segments of the economy that may have benefited from import protection. What we find, instead, is that most firms suffered large valuation losses on tariff-announcement days. We also document that these financial losses translated into future reductions in profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity.</span>

                              <span>US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from &quot;ordinary expenses&quot; as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people&#x27;s intuition of what &quot;living paycheck-to-paycheck&quot; means. That isn&#x27;t nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.
There is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; &quot;ordinary&quot; is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as &quot;ordinary&quot;. By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.
By contrast, the median US household has &gt;$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as &quot;ordinary&quot; and therefore not saving it. The categories of &quot;non-ordinary&quot; expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.
The implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.
Americans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.</span>

It is very misleading (at best) to say the economy is strong when a good chunk of the population live paycheck to paycheck.
A handful of companies are thriving, but barely any of its employees.</span>

                              <span>This is.. super impressive. I&#x27;d like to know how large this model is. I note that the first thing they have it do is talk to agents who can control the world gen; geez - even robots get to play video games while we work.
That said; I cannot find any:
- architecture explanation
- code
- technical details
- API access information
Feels very DeepMind / 2015, and that&#x27;s a bummer. I think the point of the &quot;we have no moat&quot; email has been taken to heart at Google, and they continue to be on the path of great demos, bleh product launches two years later, and no open access in the interim.
That said, just knowing this is possible - world navigation based on a photo and a text description with up to a minute of held context -- is amazing, and I believe will inspire some groups out there to put out open versions.</span>

As an aside, hats off to Google to being able to serve an 11 year old video with no noticeable delay from what must be the coldest of caches.</span>

Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
&quot;Dignity&quot;
It&#x27;s not New Year&#x27;s Eve yet but someone did get murdered in Manhattan today. The UnitedHealthcare CEO, they say, a few blocks from where I work. This update from the Times struck me as rather dystopian.
On the second floor of the hotel, the company&#x27;s annual investor conference continued seemingly without interruption as news of the shooting was just beginning to spread. Attendees mingled over cups of coffee, shaking hands and talking shop. &quot;Someone got shot outside,&quot; one attendee said to another as they made their way up from the lobby. Others took photos of the news crews gathering outside on their phones.
It&#x27;s good I stayed home today, then. V and I got back late last night and I didn&#x27;t feel …</span>

                              <span>During 2018-19, the U.S. levied import tariffs of 10 to 50 percent on more than $300 billion of imports from China, and in response China retaliated with high tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. Estimating the aggregate impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy is challenging because tariffs can affect the economy through many different channels. In addition to changing relative prices, tariffs can impact productivity and economic uncertainty. Moreover, these effects can take years to become apparent in the data, and it is difficult to know what the future implications of a tariff are likely to be. In a recent paper, we argue that financial market data can be very useful in this context because market participants have strong incentives to carefully analyze the implications of a tariff announcement on firm profitability through various channels. We show that researchers can use movements in asset prices on days in which tariffs are announced to obtain estimates of market expectations of the present discounted value of firm cash flows, which then can be used to assess the welfare impact of tariffs. These estimates suggest that the trade war between the U.S. and China between 2018 and 2019 had a negative effect on the U.S. economy that is substantially larger than past estimates.</span>

                              <span>I want the FBI to be disbanded.  Forever. I’ve wanted this to happen since 1970.  When the Senate hearings led by Franck Church revealed the extent of the FBI’s (and the CIA’s) infiltration of political and cultural organizations a couple years later, my hatred of the agency multiplied a hundredfold.  That being said, I don&#x27;t want the FBI to be replaced by a Donald Trump-run national police agency—a TBI, if you will. For those who don’t know and those who don’t remember, Richard Nixon tried to remake the FBI in his image back in the early 1970s.  He got very close to doing so.  According to what I’ve been able to parse over the years in my reading, conversation and other research, a big reason Nixon failed in turning the FBI into his own private police force was the presence of another powerful reactionary. That was the long time director of the Agency, J. Edgar Hoover, who only ended his directorship by dying. More

                              <span>Phoenix creator here – excited to finally have shipped this! Happy to answer any elixir/phoenix/liveview questions.
In case folks missed it, buried in the blog post is a new installer that lets folks try out elixir/phoenix in seconds. It installs elixir and generates a new phoenix project from a single command:
osx/linux:
    $ curl https://new.phoenixframework.org/yourappname | sh

    &gt; curl.exe -fsSO https://new.phoenixframework.org/app.bat; .\app.bat

https://elixir-lang.org/install.sh and
https://elixir-lang.org/install.bat
edit: You can see it in action here:
https://x.com/chris_mccord/status/1864067247255306332
Of course we also have non |sh installation guides if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after:
https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html
Now that this is out, I&#x27;m looking forward to put together a few new demos. What would folks like to see? Happy hacking!</span>

* Don&#x27;t add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed.
* Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.)
* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don&#x27;t act like it&#x27;s going to happen again next week.
* Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)
* Never forget your team is full of actual humans.</span>

                              <span>Disclosure: HPC admin who works with NIVIDA cards here.
Because, no. It&#x27;s not as simple as that.
NVIDIA has a complete ecosystem now. They have cards. They have cards of cards (platforms), which they produce, validate and sell. They have NVLink crossbars and switches which connects these cards on their card of cards with very high speeds and low latency.
For inter-server communication they have libraries which coordinate cards, workloads and computations.
They bought Mellanox, but that can be used by anyone, so there&#x27;s no lock-in for now.
As a tangent, NVIDIA has a whole set of standards for pumping tremendous amount of data in and out of these mesh of cards. Let it be GPU-Direct storage or specialized daemons which handle data transfers on and off cards.
If you think that you can connect n cards on PCIe bus and just send workloads to them and solve problems magically, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself a lot, both performance and psychology wise.
You have to build a stack which can perform these things with maximum possible performance to be able to compute with NVIDIA. It&#x27;s not just emulating CUDA, now. Esp., on the high end of the AI spectrum (GenAI, MultiCard, MultiSystem, etc.).
For other lower end, multi-tenant scenarios, they have card virtualization, MIG, etc. for card sharing. You have to complete on that, too, for cloud and smaller applications.</span>

Sometimes I wonder: if you added up all the time I&#x27;ve spent trying to figure out how exactly to word a post so as to not give any potential future employers any doubts about me, how many hours would that be? Or the time spent deciding which tracks to feature on my Bandcamp to have the best chance of someone hearing my music and thinking I might be a good fit for their projects? Or commuting to meetups that don&#x27;t particularly appeal to me, but I must go, because Networking? What percentage of my life would that add up to?

                              <span>I read Steven&#x27;s blog post this morning about imposter syndrome and the feelings that arise about sharing one’s work.
I embody those same sentiments.
A lot of my friends and family don’t know I blog or make zines. This breaks my heart because I consider these creative pursuits a big part of my life. It’s what I spend the most time thinking about.
Only recently have I nonchalantly told my bf about my website and zine making. It felt like a big deal sharing that information bc I&#x27;m such a private person, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s checked it out yet.

It&#x27;s been seven months since I started my weekly email letters, and I&#x27;ve put so much work into these missives.
I&#x27;ve asked people to financially support my email letters, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not panning out, and I&#x27;m unsure how to move forward.
Working towards something without moving the needle doesn&#x27;t feel good.
It sucks to admit failure, and it sucks that it&#x27;s not working out. Perhaps the value I thought I was providing isn&#x27;t enough to merit a financial token. idk. Maybe this is a reality I need to face.
Much self-imposed creative turmoil comes from tying my raison d’être to my writing and making. When my efforts prove financially unsuccessful, it feels like a direct hit to my purpose/aim in life, which is a terrible feeling to reconcile. I have no idea how to untangle this.
Do I hit delete on my online efforts/website and write anonymously somewhere else? Perhaps.</span>

 From the 5th to the 7th of July, Prishtina, Kosova, transformed into a hub of anarchist thought, coordination, and solidarity as it hosted the 16th edition of the Balkan Anarchist Bookfair (BAB). This first-ever anarchist gathering in an Albanian-speaking locality brought together over 250 participants from 29 countries, spanning from Chile to Azerbaijan. A total of 32 collectives and initiatives exhibited books and zines, and 18 discussions and events were organized, showcasing the movement’s all-encompassing diversity. In the true spirit of collectivism and mutual aid, participants got engage…</span>

This is what I believe:
The Universe is Neutral. It Neither Loves Nor Hates You - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that &quot;everything will be all right&quot; because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens.

                              <span>Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a while but couldn&#x27;t gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn&#x27;t work long-term. You don&#x27;t smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you&#x27;re never free from the thought &quot;I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now.&quot; That&#x27;s why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn&#x27;t help me), or some other activity where you don&#x27;t think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it&#x27;s simply a fact I didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with games if they don&#x27;t interfere with main tasks and don&#x27;t cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people&#x27;s blogs. Until recently, I didn&#x27;t even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people&#x27;s posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I&#x27;m very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it&#x27;s much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.</span>

                              <span>I kind of like Root&#x27;s approach, just make three separate rulebooks. One quickstart guide, one &quot;normal&quot; rulebook, and one &quot;law&quot; type rulebook laying out everything in almost procedural style with clear and consistent definitions etc. Many games could benefit from that.</span>

                              <span>I feel like this is a mistake. Pat&#x27;s strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel&#x27;s stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don&#x27;t think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&amp;A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.</span>

                              <span>For those not familiar with recent UK scandals, there has been one ongoing for a few years where there was a bug in a system designed by Fujitsu that was calculating the finances for post offices. This resulted in the system quoting wrong balances for post offices, and when that didn&#x27;t match the actual cash in hand, resulted in prosecutions of the postmasters responsible for those offices which in turn led to convictions, dismissals, fines, imprisonments, and suicides over a 15 year period as the computer system was presumed correct.
Anyway, it was later proven the computer system was incorrect but the government there dragged their heels on exoneration and compensation.

                              <span>I’ve been thinking about a lot of things in my life lately. One of those things is whether I should keep this blog going.
My writing here has dwindled. When I do write, I never have much of anything to say. I’ve never cared if people read what I write here, but I do care that about whether or not I’m writing something meaningful.
Nothing here has felt meaningful in quite a while.
Week Posts feel like something I have to do every week. Other posts just feel like filler, and fluff, and random bullshit that just doesn’t matter.
I wanted this to be fun, and it was. I enjoyed it for a long time. But now it just feels like work, and that’s something I just don’t want it to be.
I don’t know.
I don’t know what to do with this collection of meaningless, pointless words.</span>

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it&#x27;s not my place to change anyone&#x27;s personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children&#x27;s worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that&#x27;s idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can&#x27;t help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won&#x27;t.</span>

                              <span>I was a fine dining chef for 17 years. If you were in San Francisco during the 90s, I might have cooked for you. A simple way to increase demand is to remove or change the least popular menu item every week or every month. This technique has been so successful for me I wouldn&#x27;t waste much time doing anything else. Once I made a Napoleon pastry for a desert special while at La Folie on Polk st. which sadly closed recently. I had extra pastry cream and made Paris-Brest because we never threw out food. One waitress sold Napoleon on every table and the other waitress sold nothing but Paris-Brest. The dishes were fundamentally the same so I made both anytime I did one or the other as a special because waitstaff for reasons not explained in the article will sell nothing but one and others the other. I made cheese dishes to sell before the desert and fruit soups in the summer. This is the mid 90s and we were tracking data. The chef pulled me aside and showed me the sales from the previous month because I sold 1.2 deserts per customer.
Nonetheless, for the last six years I cooked I was a private chef on a mega yacht. People ask me if the guests told me what they want to eat. I say never because I never asked what people want to eat. I cooked what I want to eat and then make enough for the guests and crew. It is the best menu strategy. In fine dining, the customers make decisions all day long and in the case of being a private yacht chef, the guests are making million and billion dollar decisions. The last thing they want to do is have to decide what to eat for dinner. The family I cooked for rarely ate off the boat. And when they did it was because I said something like, &quot;I hear there is a very good restaurant in St. Barts named ....,&quot; which was code for &quot;I want the night off.&quot;
I believe the reason one waitress would sell every last Paris-Brest and the other would sell every last Napoleon was because they told the guests in the restaurant what they wanted to eat for desert. They made the decision for the guests.</span>

Title: Time and Being

 Everything has its cost: our time, once spent, can be bought back neither by king nor trillionaire. We give up our time for what we do not want; 10-20 years for a house, 5-10 for a car, 50-100 hours per month for food, then phone bills, utilities, holiday gifts, shopping shopping shopping. We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt. Our careers become our lives. 
 In exchange for lost time we reproduce ourselves as obedient laborers, our consciousness accepts the global economic system as not only necessary but good, our taxes directly fund the imperialist monstrosities of the day, while our contribution to the GDP indirectly funds them. 
 We aim…</span>

Title: Union Independence?
Date: 19 March 1933
Notes: Originally published in Solidaridad Obrera as “¿Independencia sindical?”. English translation by Chuck Morse.

 One of the most pressing questions in our organization at the moment pertains to the anarchist’s influence in the unions. I remember past times when anarchists, who shunned rather than sought organizational posts, were seen as the best guarantee of revolutionary success, thanks to their moral solvency and especially their revolutionary intransigence. But apparently things have changed and now it is that very intransigence that is attacked most harshly.

Title: Not even if they order it, Captain!

Notes: Written in response to Captain Rojas, who when asked why he carried out the Casas Viejas massacre, responded that he was following orders. Originally published in Solidaridad Obrera. English translation by Churck Morse.

 Captain, I’ve seen my comrades fall in slow death throes and then collapse on the ground, blood pouring out of their mouths, while life flees through small holes in their foreheads. These holes of death crush the skulls of their victims and comprehension in those who reflect upon them. Anido and Arlegui ordered it. 
 I’ve seen kicks destroy teeth, eyebrows, and lips; men fall unconscious only to be revived with pails of water…</span>

Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with &quot;driver impairment&quot; tech which was called a &quot;kill switch&quot;. Media rushed to say it&#x27;s not really a kill switch, just &quot;sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements&quot; and &quot;block the driver from operating the vehicle&quot;. So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497

Title: The State and Social Economy
Date: 1902
Notes: Note In this text, taken from Pages of Social History, the author dismantles the idea that the state is a useful tool for the emancipation of the working class and that it can be used as a point of passage towards the stateless and classless society, as sustained by Marxists and social-democrats alike.

 If the fatalist law had turned many Socialists from the economic struggle, and driven the masses exclusively into electoral agitation, that would have been an evil, but only a partial one. For example, in Germany, where the Social Democratic party boasts so remarkable a success, the conditions of labor are far worse not…</span>

                              <span>Recently I wrote about needing to quit social media again, and I was debating internally even more after that. I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam&#x27;s post about social media, and it clicked for me.
I deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.
What I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I&#x27;ve grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I&#x27;ve had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.
Now that I&#x27;m unshackled again, I&#x27;m making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I&#x27;m tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I&#x27;m doing the same for other people.</span>
