                              <span>This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).</span>

&gt; Could an AI agent craft compelling emails that would capture people&#x27;s attention and drive engagement, all while maintaining a level of personalization that feels human? I decided to find out.
&gt; The real hurdle was ensuring the emails seemed genuinely personalized and not spammy. I knew that if recipients detected even a whiff of a generic, mass-produced message, they&#x27;d tune out immediately.
&gt; Incredibly, not a single recipient seemed to detect that the emails were AI-generated.

The technical part surprised me: they string together multiple LLMs which do all the work. It&#x27;s a shame the author&#x27;s passions are directed towards AI slop-email spam, all for capturing attention and driving engagement.
How much of our societal progress and collective thought and innovation has gone to capturing attention and driving up engagement, I wonder.</span>

Its purpose was to explain and justify violent opposition to British “occupation.”  By 1776 gendered and racialized violence was already deeply ingrained within the white settlers.  It was the product of what it took from 1619/20 forward to seize and hold territory, to enslave and keep enslaved at least 500,000 Black people and to control deviant white settlers. (For context as to the latter, the Salem Witch trials were in 1692/93.) More

As a result, even those few who do actually believe victims of abuse and see the danger such abuse poses to them still often respond to the conditions the victim is entrapped within in ways that ultimately affirm the abuser’s narrative and fur…</span>

 Death will come for us all. But, for now, we must put our shattered hearts back together. We need to organize. We need to fight. We need to grieve. Yet, we are not free to grieve, the same way we are not free to be. Not free to love. Not free to live. Countless surviving families and friends were vultured in one of their most vulnerable times. Countless victims of patriarchal honor killings were buried by their murderers. Count…</span>

Notes: From Sheffield Action Group’s Troublemakers zine, this important piece stands on its own

 As students at university, we have a lot more to say about the global and national role of our institutions — this will come at another point. For now we will focus on primary and secondary school. Many reading this will have left 13 years of schooling, likely hating most of it, and may not have thought a lot about the scale of its impact on our lives and how things could have been so, so different. 
 School is a class stratifier along eugenic lines. Those deemed more intelligent by their ability to absorb and spit out information in tests are seen as more suited for higher paying jobs and therefore, by this society’s lo…</span>

 Imagination is a magic carpet 
 Upon which we may soar 
 To distant lands and climes 
 And even go beyond the moon 
 To any planet in the sky 
 If we came from nowhere here 
 Why can’t we go somewhere there?

 I end up spending a lot of time in Jimbocho, the old bookseller’s district in Tokyo. Hours and hours I rifle through piles and stacks of dusty pulp hunting for gems.

 Generally men, rightly or wrongly, claim to have an intellectual and moral superiority over women, in addition to physical superiority. So be it! I want to grant it. 
 Strangely enough, in the vast majority of cases the man who considers himself superior to the woman takes little or no effort to reduce her inferiority and to raise the woman to his level. 
 This happens more especially among men who have a wife or partner. It would be logical that, if only out of a feeling of pride, the h…</span>

 And they said, oh, are you the the lads that have come to fight in Lebanon? And we said yeah, that’s us. And we sat in the back of this Peugeot car and I remember Lero nudging me, and there was a handgun underneat the dashboard and there was a butt of what was a Kalashnikov underneath one of the seats. So I was like, well, this is the real deal isn’t it?

 The ecological crisis profoundly impacts the material conditions of social reproduction, extending beyond “natural disasters” to encompass a deepening of the contradictions inherent in capitalism. This crisis does not only manifest itself in events like floods, droughts, and pandemics, it also plays a direct role in fueling conflicts, social unrest, and mass displacement. In what follows, we attempt to lay out a comprehensive argument for the connection between the ecological crisis and the rise of what we call the post-fascist current, a poli…</span>

 In its Spring 2001 issue, the Oregon-based magazine Green Anarchy ran an anonymous article with the title: “The EZLN is NOT Anarchist: Or Struggles at the Margins and Revolutionary Solidarity.” Writing from an anarchist perspective, the author advanced a fierce critique of the Zapatista National Liberation Army—the militant anticolonial, anticapitalist Indigenous movement which had led an uprising and established autonomous zones in southern Mexico several years before, and which is often cited by anarchists as an example of a suc…</span>

 The Kate Sharpley Library aims to preserve the history of the anarchist movement and record and commemorate the lives of the people who made up the movement. It’s always good to see other people plugging away at the same task. The first translation of a piece by Imanol that we put up was ‘The Massana Gang’ which went in KSL: Bulletin of the Kate Sharpley Library No. 97–98, February 2019. Since then we’ve been glad to host translations of his studies from El Salto which are …</span>

 For the past several years, Indigenous organizations in Australia have been issuing “Original Passports” to asylum seekers who have been detained or denied legal status by the Australian government. Most recently, in May 2012, passports were issued to two detained Tamil asylum seekers.

 Intro SCI Rockview is a prison in central Pennsylvania where incarcerated comrades have been facing repression for demanding justice in the face of impunity by racist COs and following a year of prisoner deaths due to institutional toxicity and guard violence. We speak to an outside supporter about the situation at Rockview, the reactions of administration, inside / outside relationships and solidarity that have flared up.

 Israel is making sure it will be remembered in history as a pioneer of genocide. Multiple Israeli military sources have testified that the Israeli military is using AI to guide missile and bomb strikes against Palestinians[1]. If the Israeli military’s Artificial Intelligence determines that a person is a military member of Hamas, the Israeli military will systematically approve of a missile or bomb strike to murder that person and any civilians in the immediate vicinity.

 If there are two contemporary anarchist theorists whose work occupies and influences my thought the most, they are Kevin Carson and Wayne Price. Carson has spent a huge segment of his career not just reconstructing a mutualist political economy as an alternative to the anarchist default to the economics of Karl Marx but also making incredibly original contributions to the fields of decentralized technology/production and spontaneous organization theory. Wayne Price in turn has dedicated his mind to a task that at first seems wholly opposite to Carson’s: working to adapt Marxist economics and political strategy to an anarchist co…</span>

 A wave of campus building occupations took place in response to austerity measures following the recession of 2008. As today’s Gaza solidarity movement begins to experiment with encampments and building occupations, it could be instructive to learn from the previous generation of student activists. 
 On April 22, 2024, inspired by the resilience of the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University and other demonstrators around the country, students at Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, California occupied Siemens Hall. This represented the first confrontational bu…</span>

 On April 17, students at Columbia University and Barnard College set up an encampment in solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide at the hands of the Israeli military.

                              <span>The Administration’s policy in Gaza is a failure and a threat to U.S. national security. America’s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to, Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza. This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and U.S. laws, but it has also put a target on America’s back. More

                              <span>Something has happened in connection with Israel’s savage war in Gaza that no one expected and that few even now want to discuss. It cannot be summarized numerically – not even when the number of dead and missing Palestinians now exceeds 38,000 and when the total number of casualties is well over 120,000 – the equivalent, in population terms, of 14 million Americans. Nor can it be expressed by describing the effects of starvation, disease, and psychological damage on the surviving two million-plus Gazans, 85% of whom have been displaced from their homes, and who now face continued air and ground strikes aimed at the remaining forces of Hamas.  More

                              <span>There are continuous lies being said about Venezuela by media and politicians. As the next Venezuelan presidential elections draws near in late July there has been a plethora of unsubstantiated accusations of fraud, with nary any evidence.[1]  Steve Ellner, Professor Emeritus at the University of Oriente, Venezuela, comments on the media barrage against Venezuela: “True  More

                              <span>I really love the idea of having a Blogroll. When checking out a new blog, after reading and perusing said blog, I typically check to see if it has one. I think it’s one of the best ways to find new people to subscribe to, new content to read, and/or new perspectives to be exposed to. However, I don’t have one on my blog. Hypocritical? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just really personal preference.
I grew up in the days of MySpace, and this irrational want to be included in everyone’s Top 8. Then when you’re in their Top 8, you watch that list like a hawk in case you drop from Top 2 to Top 5, or even worse, drop off altogether. Granted, blogrolls are a bit different since there’s no hard limit on how many can be included (or specified order), but the idea is similar.
You see, I’m fine and OK with no…</span>

                              <span>I spent the long weekend clearing the cobwebs from my apartment.
The main purge was throwing out YEARS of old diaries and journals—all of them. Not one survived.
I&#x27;ve been thinking about doing this for a long time. Reading them made me feel horrible, and they all seemed to circle the same themes. Lugging those boxes full of journals to each new apartment felt tiresome. It was time to let them go.
I feel good about it. I&#x27;m free: to untangle myself from past narratives; from reinforcing and remembering things I don&#x27;t wish to remember; to change; to reinvent the person I want to be.
Next on the to-get-rid-of list: books, clothes, paper ephemera, apps, expired kitchen things, tucked-away closet articles, + bathroom items.
Sketchbook things:

There is a rough idea of what it will be about, but not much more than that. It usually works best this way, I think. As usual, my phone and computer are set to &quot;do not disturb&quot; when I&#x27;m writing.
Even the basic idea itself often comes out of some kind of void: when I&#x27;m walking, driving, or eating, for example. Poof! Suddenly something appears, like the characteristic light bulb symbol.
Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.
This is what Nikhil writes in the post Get Bored.
I think it&#x27;s so well put. That&#x27;s precisely how it is. Just as a document or canvas needs a blank surface to be used, we, as individuals, need an inner void to make room for creation.
Our lives are full of excellent opportunities to create these spaces. They&#x27;re there every day: we&#x27;re waiting for the elevator, we&#x27;ve stopped at a traffic light, or we&#x27;re in line at the grocery store. Magnificent opportunities for a moment of “boredom” — an invitation to creativity.
Your best blog post ever could appear the next time you&#x27;re on an escalator doing absolutely nothing.
“Bored to death” is the birth of creativity.

                              <span>Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.
But what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There’s no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there’s no sense of urgency in your mind, there’s calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.
When your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That’s when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.
Productivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That’s when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.
When you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.</span>

We find that while inflation hurts everyone, it hurts the poor in particular. When the source of inflation is a supply shock, fighting inflation aggressively hurts the poor even more, however, while the opposite is true for demand shocks, as discussed in the companion post.</span>

                              <span>Article III of the U.S. Constitution is incredibly brief [1].
I propose the Supreme Court be reconstituted such that for each case a panel of judges from the appellate courts is chosen by lot. They hear that case, write their opinion, and then go back to that work. New case, new lot.
Having a permanent bench of judicial oligarchs made sense before telecommunication. It doesn’t anymore. Every ancient democracy used randomness to control corruption. I think it’s time we took a lesson from them.
(Note: this could be done by statute. How the supreme Court is constituted is entirely left to Congress.)

                              <span>&gt;The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority&#x27;s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy&#x27;s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune.
I would consider this an extreme knee jerk take, but it&#x27;s Sotomayor saying it.

The President shouldn&#x27;t have the legal authority to conduct any drone strikes without a declaration of war from Congress. We&#x27;ve been ignoring the Constitution for a very long time.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a relatively new arrival to these shores having landed here to visit, but not stay and then, on meeting my partner, I began to visit more often till it was decided. I would stay, stay and pursue first, permanent residency and then, citizenship.
Well, after living here, in Quebec, long enough to apply, and sponsored by my partner, I applied to be a permanent resident. A lot of money later after being vetted like I was about to work at Los Alamos in New Mexico, on some Top Secret weapons program or with Aliens, I was finally cleared as being a desirable alien and given residency. Which afforded me certain rights and privileges.
From this point I had to be a resident for at least 3 years before I could then apply to become a citizen. Again, this is not an easy path or a cheap venture let me tell you. And, without the support of a sponsor—in my case, my partner—near on impossible to do. The financial requirement alone, is prohibitive to so many. But, me and mine persisted and finally, in August 2018, I passed the last hurdle in a very long and meticulous process to achieve citizenship. I presented myself to the relevant authorities, made a declaration signed my paperwork and was told I was at that point, barring any further complications, a citizen of Canada.
The finishing touch to make it all wholly official came later when, online, with about 100+ other participants, I swore the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, and sang O Canada in Canada&#x27;s two official languages in front of a judge, online, with my fellow compatriots.
I was then officially a Canadian citizen. And I have never been more proud of myself, and my partner, at realising a dream.
And here I am, a few years later, on Canada Day, celebrating the fact I am a Canadian.
Happy Canada Day everyone! 🇨🇦

                              <span>Ever since WeblogPoMo ended in May, I&#x27;ve been stuck in some sort of writing rut. I&#x27;m still posting a few times a week so it may not be as obvious, but I&#x27;ve noticed myself living inside my head too much lately. And I think I need to get myself out.
As I always do, I&#x27;ve been overthinking about what I write and create. Rarely are things perfect enough for me to post, so they just kind of hang out in my drafts, or just stay written inside my head. Because of that, my head is now full of these nonsensical words, and I need to find a way to get them out.
I&#x27;ve been considering starting 100 days to offload, and I keep giving myself reasons to delay. I&#x27;ve told myself I&#x27;d start it in August for my birthday month, or maybe in November of NaBloPoMo (National Blog Posting Month in November), but honestly why wait? There&#x27;s no better day than today to start, right? (But also because it’s a brand new month.)
So I guess here&#x27;s my official 1st day post. 100 posts in a year. Check back with me in 364 days. I&#x27;ll let you know how I did (or you can follow along!).
I&#x27;ll be tracking my post here, or in my #100daystooffload tag. Come along for the ride — I would love to have you around to (secretly or not so secretly) nudge me and keep me accountable.
Ready, set, go!

                              <span>I grew up just outside of Johannesburg, which is touted to be &quot;the greenest city in the world&quot;. During the summer, when seen from above, it&#x27;s a verdant, green landscape, with the tops of buildings popping through the canopy.

Yes, there&#x27;s a full city beneath those trees.
However, this is not what the land originally looked like.
To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It&#x27;s known colloquially as eGoli, or &quot;The City of Gold&quot;. Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don&#x27;t have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it&#x27;s mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.
This form of extraction leads to the crushing of millions of tons of ro…</span>

                              <span>I have always tried to optimise for the right environments. I feel like that is the most powerful thing to do. You meet the right people. You generate ideas. You vibe. You get shit done. It&#x27;s amazing.
The close environments of family, friends, and colleagues indeed have the most impact. So I never thought about the overarching environment I was part of, the city, the country. It is only over the past month I have been thinking about it.
It started with that famous hit-and-run case in Pune. Not the hit-and-run itself. But the coverup. The systemic failure. The corruption. The stories of this happening often and without any consequence all over the country, all the time.
Then it was the roof at the airport collapsing and killing a man. It is the traffic here in Bangalore. How no one cares about traffic rules. How the streets just fill up with water every time it rains. The power cuts. There is nothing new to all this. I grew up in India. It was all around me. I just ignored it.
I feel like I can&#x27;t ignore it anymore. So the choice is to fix it or to leave. I have tried to fix things in my own way. It made me realise I live in a bubble and the majority of the country is much different from what I am. Or from where I want things to be. It needs a massive culture change.
To change it I will need to get political and dedicate my life. I am not willing to get into the shitshow that is politics nor want to dedicate my life to this. I want to do cool things in my life with cool people. And if I feel like the city or the country I live in blocks it. I will move.</span>

                              <span>I decided to switch to Bear Blog about 7 months ago from a static site setup. It&#x27;s been a good experience so far. Pre-Bear, I endlessly tweaked and updated the site, probably to avoid actually writing. Even more user friendly platforms like Wordpress and Ghost require a significant amount of operational work. The beauty of Bear Blog is the constraints. Taking away the option of migrating from Jekyll to Hugo to Astro on a whim, for example, has dramatically increased the amount of time I spend writing.
I also really liked the discover feed. It&#x27;s much more difficult to attract readers and find new, interesting blogs than it was in the blogging heyday.
Recently though, the discover feed looks increasingly similar to the type of engagement farming you&#x27;d see on Twitter or Reddit. I find myself …</span>

Title: Anti-Social Anarchy
Subtitle: A Short Response to Ausonia Calabrese’s “Against Individualism”
Date: Mar 20, 2020
Source: anarchistnews.org

 Marxism shares one thing in common with other authoritarian ideologies: they are against the individual. Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or “anti-state communists,” they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin’s “Anarchism” or “Socialism”, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese’s Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. 
 The main gist of the essay is that individuals are not a real mate…</span>

In a revolt against techno-optimism and the real-world violence it upholds, members of radical research collective Lucy Parsons Labs (LPL) call for an empiricism rooted in technopolitical critique. Drawing from their own years of labor in the struggles against racial and surveillance capitalism, current work in HCI, and radical theorists like Alfredo M. Bonanano and Modibo Kadalie, LPL invites us to incorporate an ethics of rebellion and progress our tech practices into principled, anti-authoritarian praxis.

                              <span>Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Treasury has issued debt in two main forms: nominal bonds, which provide fixed-cash scheduled payments, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—or TIPS—which provide the holder with inflation-protected payments that rise with U.S. inflation. At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike. After briefly reviewing the theoretical and empirical links between TIPS and Treasury yields, this post, based on a recent research paper, explores whether market perceptions of U.S. sovereign credit risk can help explain the relative valuation of these financial instruments.</span>

While I had already conceptualized and begun writing this piece prior to the publication of “An Anarchist Anti-Gun Manifesto,” the final form of “No Such Thing as Neutral” has been largely influenced by the response to the former. In particular, I was inspired by the common response of guns being “a tool” and “therefore neutral,” of the assumption that my critique of guns, and their world of relations, was of a moral character, and as such the concept of “neutrality” would hold some rhetorical weight. This piece is an attempt to break out of the confinement of moral frameworks …</span>

 We must bear in mind that no government, honest as it is, can decree the abolition of misery. It is the people themselves, the hungry, the disinherited, who have to abolish misery. – Ricardo Flores Magón (Regeneration, Nov. 19, 1910)

 This afternoon we met with Dolores Villalobo from the Consejo Indígena Popular de Oaxaca “Ricardo Flores Magón” (CIPO-RFM). She began the discussion with an explanation of who was Ricardo Flores Magón–an Indigenous person from Oaxaca who rose up against Porfirio Diáz in the Mexican Revolution. He was persecuted so fled into exile into the United States, but was imprisoned at Levenworth where he was executed. Franciso Madero offered him the vice presidency, but Flores Magón said he preferred jail to his government that was not of the people and who did not represent the change for which they had fought.

What is Anarchism?
 Anarchism is a political theory which opposes the State and capitalism. It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one. 
 Anarchism is also a political movement. Anarchists take part in day-to-day struggl…</span>

INTRODUCTION.
 I have been through a lot. For more than a decade now, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has waged a state terror program designed to drive down me to suicide in order to permanently silence me and, in the process, amassed over four thousand pages of files on me, less than three hundred pages of which they ar…</span>

Special introductory note by the editors
 In the “Policies of this Website” we explain that we are seeking to promote discussions “where participants are engaged in active listening and a search for commonalities or convergences—giving at least as much emphasis to this as we do to ‘clarifying differences.’ The overall goal of our project is not just to recapitulate well-established views but to transcend them if/when we can in order to create a stronger collective synthesis of revolutionary thought.”

Introduction
 What if we didn’t need bosses, politicians, borders, landlords, police, or prisons? 
 There was a time when each of these things did not exist, and whatever you may believe now about their absolute necessity, have you considered that there can be a time again when we can do much better without them? 
 Anarchists dare to desire a world without rule. 
 Neither the rule of the minority nor the rule of the majority. Neither the rule of the capitalists nor the rule of the bureaucrats. Neither the rule of men nor the rule of royalty nor the rule of the elderly nor the rule of warlords. An-archy. Without rule.

 On March 28, 2024, the streets surrounding Milan’s main courthouse, the Palace of Justice, are swarmed with different branches of Italian law enforcement. The municipal police have brought one patrol car, casually parked next to a newspaper kiosk. State police and military police (the Carabinieri) can be seen on the side streets, sporting riot gear in their trademark armored vans, light and dark blue respectively.

The simian redemption
 “You don’t know nothing, but you don’t need to know. The wisdom’s in the trees, not the glass windows”. – Jack Johnson[1]
 A lot of theories have surfaced in the relatively new millennium concerning the human species’ relationship to the planet it calls home. Historically, the mechanized view on nature advocated in the 17th century Scientific Revolution is criticized by ecological movements as alienating humanity from its origins. With the advent of the clock for example, man started measuring time according to its own inventions, exempting the sun of this function. Likewise, the clock became a metaphor for the machinery of nature, and “God” bec…</span>

 What happened to the notion of revolution? In his companion piece to “The Movement of Refusal,” Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen retraces the rise and fall of revolutionary theory from its earliest systematic expression during the First International to the first proletarian offensive of 1917–1921, and onwards to the crisis at the hands of a bourgeois “anti-fascism” that instrumentalized the specter of fascism as a means to save capitalism, before ditching it, after 1945, in order to integrate the laboring class into the nation state. Although the post-war welfare state was the great achievement of the workers’ movement, the price paid for it was the ab…</span>

Title: Scenes from the pro-Palestine encampment at OttawaU
Source: https://mutualrage.wordpress.com/2024/05/03/what-the-student-pro-palestine-encampments-are-actually-like/

 The other day my friend and I decided we wanted to visit the student-led pro-Palestine encampment that has recently sprung up on the lawn of OttawaU. On one of the organizing group’s social media pages, they had recently sent out a message informing people they were accepting donations, specifically of certain types of things (like hot water, garbage bags, blue tarps, yoga mats, etc.). I felt driven by the urge to donate whatever I could – so, during my shift, I furtively searched the back storeroom, digging through years’ worth of defunct paper cups, lids, and out-of-season teas. There was enough …</span>

A large swath of research in mathematics education claims to serve an equity agenda. However, too often this research is conducted atheoretically, failing to disrupt the worldviews that produce injustice and oppression, for both the researcher and the reader. Responding to this commonplace divergence of intent and impact, we propose a methodological approach that anchors research and praxis in a sociopolitical foundation of anarchism. We seek cohesion of theory and practice by consciously demanding that values common to the equity agenda—cooperation, mutual a…</span>

Abstract[1] [2]
 In this text, written as a speech for the 1st Anarchist Fair in Rio de Janeiro, contradictions of the historically predatory relationship of brazilian democracy with brazilian travestis and transsexuals are presented, paying attention to the ontological marginality of the travesti body under the capitalist patriarchy of white supremacy. Based on this reflection, transfeminist challenges to radical and anarchist politics are presen…</span>

We refer elsewhere to Comrade Creaghe’s plucky assault upon the landlord robbers. As some of our readers may like to know what he has to say for himself, we quote the following from the first issue of our bright little contemporary, the Sheffield Anarchist, to which we wish all success.
 Comrades, 
 As I find we are now boycotted by the Sheffield Telegraph, which, no doubt, while it silences us, will continue, with its usual sense of fair play, to attack us in its columns, I write to you for the satisfaction of the only public we respect, namely, the workers.

 ‘Metacrisis’ is my chosen umbrella term for the escalation of multiple global crises of climate, ecology, and political economy, which have reached such a point now that all radical organising is a form of crisis response. And I know for folk on the sacrificial frontlines of capitalism, the terms ‘radical organising’ and ‘crisis response’ belie that they have to fight just to survive.

Same on the Mac: If you want to build a Mac application, your best bet will be AppKit or SwiftUI and using system controls. And when the OS updates your application will either update with it, or need only minor tweaks and a rebuild to look good.</span>

That&#x27;s not a problem, it&#x27;s a feature. I am absolutely bloody sick of apps that go out of their way to reinvent the standard UI controls in perplexing ways and behave unexpectedly. Following the system UI preferences is what you should do, and it irritates your users if you don&#x27;t.
There is a “hidden” dark mode for Win32 controls used by Windows File Explorer that you can activate, but it covers only some of the controls and still doesn’t look good.
Don&#x27;t do that. If you use the regular Win32 controls then they will automatically get the styling the user has set.
I&#x27;ve been writing Win32 apps for close to 30 years now. It&#x27;s sad to see the regression in UIs over the years.</span>

Specifically, the requirement for completely custom GUI styling without writing his own render functions means it’s really a task of selecting easy, customizable GUI libraries rather than generic GUI work.
The requirements to be self-contained executables and under a 40MB limit also rule out a lot of options. The author admits that Qt could have met these requirements but the open-source licensing part wasn’t compatible with his goals and he didn’t want to pay for a license.
If you relax the requirements to tolerate some dependencies, allow larger download sizes, or to simply use built-in Windows GUI controls the situation is very different.
For writing a lightweight, completely custom GUI with no external dependencies and permissive licensing I could have guessed ImGui would be the answer before I started reading.</span>

                              <span>I was an infantryman in the Army for ten years, from 1998 to 2008, and deployed three times, twice to Iraq,
Encounters with IEDs were common, especially during the surge.
So many of my friends have died to suicide or have killed themselves due to drugs and/or alcohol that it is hard to keep track.
Now that primadonna seals are dying maybe someone will pay attention.
Thankfully the only lasting effects of my deployments seem to be a bad back and distaste for authority.</span>

Not mentioned in this article, but certainly related, was the Canadian governments unprecedented step to freeze hundreds of bank accounts of protestors during COVID protests using their Emergencies Act. While I couldn&#x27;t be more politically removed from the protestors, using a legislative power envisioned for war like conditions to personally ruin protestors financially is more than worrying.

                              <span>So, here goes.
Being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is especially hard when I live alone, well, sort of. I don’t talk much with my mom. Maybe I should, but I don’t intend to talk to her for the moment. That means, despite living with her under the same roof, I feel very lonely. And my mental health starts to deteriorate when I am alone and bored.
Thoughts could drive someone crazy when that is all they have being the single person in the room.
I am turning to y’all for support, so please write me emails at corneliuswastaken@proton.me. I would love anything. Book /music/video games recommendations, memes, photos of your pet, tell me about yourself. Heck, send me a string of random letters and numbers if you want. It is just nice to know that there is someone out there listening to my rambling, and that I am not alone. Expect the reply to happen in a while though. Replying to messages becomes a chore when self-care is in dire need.
Thank you.</span>

And so today got me thinking of some of the digital cameras I’ve owned in the past. I’ve owned quite a few that I regrettably no longer own, or have forgotten so we’ll start the with the ones I do remember.
A handful of Canon Coolpix: loved these things, and I feel like they’re making a comeback. I think I owned 2-3 of these in the early days. At one point, my university gave me one to document my “life as a student” as a part of their marketing campaign.
Nikon D40: my very first DSLR. I remember working endless amounts of hours at Staples over the summer to save up enough money to buy this on my own. This was around when it first came out, and was roughl…</span>

Next to me is Murakami&#x27;s Wind-up Bird Chronicles, which I recently started. On the table next to my bed, I have my journal open, where I was reflecting on my June. I am drinking a hot cup of Americano and having dark chocolate - my favorite. I spontaneously thought of sharing some notes from June with you.
I think of June as the month where I decided to take my life more seriously. Not to say I was ever a careless, unserious person. I always worked hard, but it was more like if you aim to stay alive for the long run, you need to get it together.
Thinking about it though, June was the first month I felt proud of myself since a long time. During the start of the month, I set a long list of goals for myself: ex…</span>

 The great European war has come. The truth has almost staggered our imagination, we do not know what to do and the one only definite thought is that we must win. To this end all our efforts are bent. We fight, with the men and women of France, of Russia, of Belgium. It is exactly the same, alas! with the men and women of Germany and Austria. We are all prompted by the same strong feelings of patriotism. We and they rejoice to give our lives that our country may be victorious, and more than all do we each rejoice if we may take the life of another. 
 Such is war. It is strange, is it not? Almost to a man we, in the countries concerned, have thrown aside what belief we …</span>

1. Introduction
 Mahayana Buddhism divides human history into three ages: the Age of the Right Dharma (shōbō), which occurred in the first 500 years after the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, where enlightenment was fully possible and the Buddha’s teachings were maintained; the Era of Semblance Dharma (zōhō), the 500 years following the shōbō era, where the Buddhist teachings and practice still existed but were deteriorated and lacked confirmed enlightenment; and finally, the Dharma-Ending Age (mappō), in which gradually all teachings bequeathed by the Buddha wi…</span>

Introduction
 Making the shift to the consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that we can do to build a democratic society. Consensus can give us the power we need to focus our society’s attention on improving education, making peace, providing universal healthcare and creating the world we desire. 
 Consensus creates true democracy—not the democracy in name only that sickens any aware person. Consensus empowers all who participate in it. In-name-only democracy disempowers all who participate in it (who dutifully trudge to the polls every few years to select new masters). True democracy might be a large part of the solution to …</span>

 Once considered the cool, edgy version of polyamory, a sort of polyam++, relationship anarchy is increasingly coming under scrutiny because it is being used to justify a specific kind of harmful behavior in relationships. 
 This behavior is probably best described in blunt terms: (mostly) cis guys are fucking around with (mostly) femmes, and disconnecting from them the moment there’s any mention of romantic feelings, hopes for a more ent…</span>

Abstract
 This paper proposes new perspectives on anarchism, indigeneity, and Afro-descendent struggles, by discussing the case of Brazilian anarchists’ commitment to luta afroindígena. They mean by this term the intersection of indigenous and Afro-descendant resistances for the recognition of land, against the violence of states, agribusiness, and extractivism. I argue that this case offers key insights to radical geographies, and to the broader field of decolonial scholarship, to challenge cultural and racial essentialisms by connecting different militant traditions. I also argue t…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ll add one point. You are not your job. Don&#x27;t take things personally at work. And never be afraid to leave if you&#x27;re not fitting in with your company .
I&#x27;ve left jobs over a few reasons, primarily bad managers, increased compensation, and bad code .
If people are writing bad code at your company, to the point where you know it&#x27;s going to come back to haunt you later, it&#x27;s okay to just walk away .
Don&#x27;t embarrass anybody, don&#x27;t escalate to a manager and explain how horrible the code is. I was in a situation where someone our team was effectively writing code that pretended to do things it really didn&#x27;t. I got into a really nasty argument with half my team about this. I ended up putting in my two weeks, and then my manager was like oh you were right the entire time .
Life is too short to deal with incompetent people.</span>

It would literally be impossible for congress to make a law covering every single nuance agencies are tasked with. This Supreme Court knows it.

                              <span>Recently watched someone close die over a couple days, after a long decline.
The last 24 hours were monstrous to inflict on anyone. Torture. Evil.
Hours and hours of faltering breathing, often restarting with what was plainly a panicked adrenaline-pumping response. It looked like they felt like they were about to drown every few minutes, hour, after hour, no relief. No IV fluids (terminal anyway, so no trying to keep them alive with techniques like that) and unable to drink, so certainly terribly thirsty the whole time. Unable to communicate or really engage with surroundings, and quite high on pain meds anyway (the closest thing to a mercy in all this). It’s fucked up that that’s a fairly normal way for dying people to make their exit. I’m sure there are all kinds of problems with trying to provide a way out when someone can’t make the choice for themselves, without opening it up to abuse, but damn, I hope this isn’t the best we can do because it’s terrible.</span>

Just like congress can legislate abortion laws rather than leaving it to judicial precedence.

It was in C, but the process was expected to run for months without crashing or running out of memory; if it had an abnormal exit, you&#x27;d (the owner as set in some code thing) get an email with the core backtrace. If it had a memory leak, ops would be on you quickly. Ops was considered a primary driver of requirements to dev, and absolutely everything could be reloaded into a running server without restarting it. There was a TCP control port where a TCL interpreter inside the service was exposed and generally you wrote the (very simple, CS 101 style) TCL commands to manage the server.

* Creating a mutable snapshot of the entire codebase takes a second or two.
* Builds are perfectly reproducible, and happen on build clusters. Entire C++ servers with hundreds of thousands of lines of code can be built from scratch in a minute or two tops.
* The build config language is really simple and concise.
* Code search across the entire codebase is instant.
* File history loads in an instant.
* Line-by-line blame loads in a few seconds.
* Nearly all files in supported languages have instant symbol lookup.
* There&#x27;s a consistent style enforced by a shared culture, auto-linters, and presubmits.
* Shortcuts for deep-linking to a file/version/line make sharing code easy-peasy.
* A ton of presubmit checks ensure uniform code/test quality.
* Code reviews are required, and so is pairing tests with code changes.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m impressed that they can so easily dispose of 40 years of law making by Congress that assumed that agencies would interpret the statutes and make rules for regulating their area of authority.
Now Congress is going to have to specify every possible consequence of laws in the statutes, otherwise a judge will decide.
So agencies will not have any power to actually regulate.
Awesome logic work, but terrible legal thinking without considering the side effects of the decision.</span>

                              <span>This seems like the judicial branch just voted to give itself substantially more power.
Are there any checks against this? Or can justices just keep granting themselves more powers and invalidating any restraints?</span>

                              <span>From Justice Kagan&#x27;s dissent on page 82:
&gt; This Court has long understood Chevron deference to reflect what Congress would want, and so to be rooted in a presumption of legislative intent. Congress knows that it does not—in fact cannot—write perfectly complete regulatory statutes...
&gt; It knows that those statutes will inevitably contain ambiguities that some other actor will have to resolve, and gaps that some other actor will have to fill. And it would usually prefer that actor to be the responsible agency, not a court...
&gt; Put all that together and deference to the agency is the almost obvious choice, based on an implicit congressional delegation of interpretive authority. We defer, the Court has explained, “because of a presumption that Congress” would have “desired the agency (rather than the courts)” to exercise “whatever degree of discretion” the statute allows. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517
U. S. 735, 740–741 (1996).
&gt; Today, the Court flips the script: It is now “the courts (rather than the agency)” that will wield power when Congress has left an area of interpretive discretion. A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris. In recent years, this Court has too often taken for itself decision-making authority Congress assigned to agencies. The Court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; its own judgment on climate change for that of the Environmental Protection Agency; and its own judgment on student loans for that of the Department of Education.</span>

                              <span>The one in my previous job, which was an admin board for a market intelligence application. Ultimately, the reason it was good was because the engineers had zero ego on top of having excellent skills. The team that set the codebase were basically 4 seniors and 3 principals (the client actually did pay for top talent in this case) so not only everything was based on industry standards, written elegantly and organized perfectly, but every time some new requirement came up, these senior / principal engineers would discuss it in the most civilized matter I have ever seen.
E.g, &quot;we need to come up with a way to implement X&quot;. Person A gives their idea, person B gives another idea and so on until everybody shared their thoughts. Then someone would say &quot;I think what person C said makes the most sense&quot; and everybody would agree and that was it. 30 minutes to hear everybody out, 3 minutes to discuss who will do it and when and the meeting was over.
I think the biggest testament to this code base was that when junior members joined the team, they were able to follow the existing code for adding new features. It was that easy to navigate and understand the big picture of.</span>

                              <span>Don’t jump straight in. Observe and see how people are moving before you get involved.
Look out for each other. If someone falls over, help them get up. You are there to have fun together.
Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience. Stay on the outside until you get your bearings. Then, when you’re ready, venture further into the center to get really wild.
Never try and intentionally hurt someone. If you get hit by accident or intentionally do not retaliate.
Treat everyone with respect and stay safe!

As part of an ongoing series on inequality and equitable growth, we have been documenting the evolution of these gaps between Black, Hispanic, and white households, in this case from the first quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2023 for a variety of assets and liabilities for a pandemic-era picture. We find that real wealth grew and that the pace of growth for Black, Hispanic, and white households was very similar across this timeframe—yet gaps across groups persist.</span>

                              <span>My understanding is this allergen over-labeling was inspired by the FDA in the first place. https://www.fastcompany.com/90830854/sesame-seed-allergen-fd...
From the linked article (from Jan 2023):
  But sesame does differ in one distinct way from eggs, peanuts, shellfish, milk, and soy: The seeds are teeny tiny and hard to keep track of. This means they’re prone to “cross-contamination,” in food-allergy terms. If you operate a bakery that makes sesame bagels, the odds are decent that rogue seeds will end up in your other products, too. Bad news for people with severe sesame allergies. But it’s also expensive and frustrating for food manufacturers to ensure the seeds are kept away from other foods, if they’re on the FDA’s major allergens list.
  
  Advocates have therefore been warning since December that the FASTER Act is poised to have a counter effect. Rather than minimize cross-contamination, as they argue the law requires, many big food brands have opted to add sesame to their bread products, then simply declare it as an ingredient. They are intentionally adding sesame flour to “avoid complying with the spirit and intent of the FASTER Act,” FARE tells Fast Company. That is cheaper than certifying that their facilities are 100% sesame-free.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Authorities allege Gehrke and King, who got married this year, knew charges were coming and had been preparing to flee. At their home, authorities found a book titled “How To Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace,” according to court papers. In one of their bags packed for their flight, there was a book titled “Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive The System,”
I guess &quot;step 15&quot; from the book was &quot;marry your criminal associates, so you&#x27;re not forced to testify against each other&quot;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spousal_privilege?
Step 1 should be &quot;don&#x27;t buy any incriminating books related to your planned disappearance&quot; followed by the next chapter, &quot;step 2: too late, already&quot;.</span>

                              <span>I think there&#x27;s a misunderstanding in what the settlement is about. As part of Purdue&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Sackler family is voluntarily providing 6 billion dollars to help settle claims opioid victims have brought against Purdue Pharma.
As a condition to provide the 6 billion dollars, the Sackler family has asked the bankruptcy judge to not even allow any new suits against the Sacklers related to the Opioid epidemic. This is something bankruptcy courts do regular for the company Purdue Pharma, but it is irregular when it comes to the Sackler family (this is not the entity going bankrupt!)
This is the issue that went up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court ruled that the protection given to the Sackler family is not something that can be given  by a bankruptcy judge during the bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma.
Matt Levine has a much better explanation here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-06-27/purdue...</span>

Title: Anarchist solidarity with the people of Ukraine
Date: 25 February 2024

 On February 24, hundreds of anarchists in several cities across Europe took to the streets in solidarity with the people of Ukraine on the second anniversary of the start of full-scale Russian invasion. The Anarchist Bloc was at actions in Warsaw, Vilnius, Berlin, Tbilisi, Vienna and Zurich. It was important for us to express words of support to people from Ukraine, whose country has been tormented by the Kremlin’s aggression for two years, to applaud the steadfastness of all those who oppose this aggression with weapons in their hands, especially our comrades. 
 At the actions we included audio messages from anarchists, who right now are holding…</span>

Title: 6 activists of the anarchist group “Black Nightingales” were arrested in Belarus

 As it became known from a propaganda video on youtube published by the state media, anarchists from the group “Black Nightingales” were detained in Belarus several months ago. According to the regime’s version, they were planning to attack the state infrastructure and sabotage the support of the Russian military in Belarus. The list of the group members includes Maria Misyuk, Trofim Barysau, Sergey Zhigalyou, Dmitry Zahoroshko, Anastasia Klimenka, and Aleksandra Pulinovich. Based on the attitude of the Belarusian regime towards anarchists, we believe that any recorded testimony was obtained under torture until the co…</span>

Title: Putin’s reelection victory in the Russian Federation

 No one doubted the ability of Vladimir Putin and his cohort to draw a 50%+ figure to maintain their own power. It would be naive to believe that any action in the controlled environment of the polling stations could affect the percentages displayed on the screens of the Russian empire and the entire planet. Whether you spoil a ballot, write a message on it, or nuke a polling station, Putin will still consistently win. 
 Smart voting, apps on phones and even prayers will not be able to influence the results of the vote. 
 But that’s not the victory we want to talk about today. Rather, we want to talk about the political victory around mobilizati…</span>
