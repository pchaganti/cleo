                              <span>Grandpa’s been trying to get my brother V and I to go to the public bathhouse with him for as long as I can remember. He asked us last time we were both here back when we were both still in elementary school. He asked us every day this past week too.
Naturally, since we don’t come from a culture where public nudity is the norm, my brother and I aren’t so keen on the idea of stripping butt-naked in front of our grandpa and his octogenarian friends. Grandpa’s tried everything to change our Nos to Yeses: at first he asked us nicely, then he tried urging us and bullying us into agreeing.
I finally caved today, more to shut him up than anything. In the wake of my uncle’s death, I’m aware that this might very well be the last time I get to spend time with my grandpa, so I figured I could lock my…</span>

a little bit after my last post, i went on some back-to-back trips around asia. i spent a few days in seoul and about a week in bali. i did actually write about both of those trips with the intention of sharing them with all of you on here but for some reason i couldn&#x27;t quite bring myself to publish it. i&#x27;ve never really written on any sort of platform before this, but i&#x27;m assuming that just like visual art, some writing is just meant to be kept to yourself.
with the only things i had written in that span of 4 weeks being kept private, i didn&#x27;t really have much else to post;  and the longer i went without posting, the harder it was to come back. this always happens to me. i did the exact same thing with my art account on t…</span>

                              <span>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rose almost simultaneously in most economies around the world. After peaking in mid-2022, inflation then went into decline—a fall that was just as universal as the initial rise. In this post, we explore the interrelation of inflation dynamics across OECD countries by constructing a measure of the persistence of global inflation. We then study the extent to which the persistence of global inflation reflects broad-based swings, as opposed to idiosyncratic country-level movements. Our main finding is that the spike and subsequent moderation in global inflation in the post-pandemic period were driven by persistent movements. When we look at measures of inflation that include food and energy prices, most of the persistence appears to be broad-based, suggesting that international oil and commodity prices played an important role in global inflation dynamics. Excluding food and energy prices in the analysis still shows a broad-based persistence, although with a substantial increase in the role of country-specific factors.</span>

 One can find the forgotten Wobbly names and faces, strike stories, union halls and martyrs’ graves in any city where the IWW earned its legendary reputation. It is easy to find thorough information on the luminaries, such as Tresca, Flynn and Giovanitti, but what about those local organizers who invited these major figures to town, and then kept working after they were gone, pouring the wine of rebellion into workers’ hearts? It may take some time, but in all probability you’ll find syndicalist monuments and hallowed ground that you walk past every day, but never knew existed.

 In the City of Philadelphia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a large group of professionals who practiced medicine or pharmacy as a livelihood, while committing great energies to the anarchist movement.

​Introduction
 Voltairine de Cleyre, by far Philadelphia’s brightest anarchist light, was 30 years old when, during the late summer or fall of 1897, she wrote the following letter in London. The letter was never finished, nor was it signed, dated, or mailed. Yet the letter, clearly in her handwriting and style, came to rest in a large group of her letters in the papers of Joseph J. Cohen (1878–1953), de Cleyre’s longtime associate in anarchism, which are stored in the Bund Collection, YIVO Archives, in New York City. It is one of the most compellin…</span>

Notes: The following article is a transcript of a speech given by Geelong Anarchist Communists member Tommy Lawson at an Independent and Peaceful Australia Network (IPAN) ‘Rally for Rafah’ held on Saturday 11th of May. Its content is supported unanimously by Geelong Anarchist Communists. We have decided to publish it today, on the 76th anniversary of the Nakba (‘catastrophe’) to declare that we stand with those resisting genocide and colonisation.

                              <span>A central feature of neo-liberal capitalism, which has ruled the global economy since the 1990s, is to deepen and widen inequalities. It makes a tiny minority indecently richer while leaving the majority in the lurch. Women and minorities such as indigenous peoples, LGBTQIA+ or racialized people are badly hit by those inequalities. In a situation in which famine and extreme poverty keep increasing, the withdrawal of the State further feeds the vicious circle of poverty and inequality. (...)

                              <span>For the longest time, I wanted to work in big tech. I got placed in one such company from campus placements. It was mostly due to my c programming skills and research work.
I am grateful for the role. I get to work on something I like. The people I work with are smart and kind. But it is just a job. Both to me and to the people I work with. One of the major perks that the HR department keeps repeating is a great work-life balance. You get time for yourself. That is very true.
Isn&#x27;t that great? You get paid well. Get enough time for a good social life and side projects. You can also fund these side projects with your salary.
Yes, but what about working in a startup? A place where a lot of super passionate people are going ham at what they do. To them, it is not a job but a mission. A sort of crazy cult. Filled with kind passionate nerds. Some place where you own part of the dream. Have equity.
It sounds nice. But such places are very rare. The startup scene in India is pretty horrible. I have heard some really bad stories. So many of the startups look cool on the outside. Have great pay even. But are horrible to work for. I have had friends experience this.
I also feel like I am not good enough for those truly cracked places yet. So I am happy where I am for now and just Skill maxxing. I want to feel like a really capable engineer. I see so many of them at my org. All are really kind and happy to guide me.
Sometimes these essays help me put my life in context and clear my thinking a lot. This was one of those.</span>

I’ve worked at an alphabet soup of think tanks: the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), the World Policy Institute (WPI), the New America Foundation, the Center for International Policy (CIP), and my current institutional home, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft (QI).

Title: Anarchist Communism in its Relation to State Socialism
Date: June 1896
Notes: Original text split between two consecutive monthly publications, with a misprint in the latter citing the first entry as having been published in July rather than June; transcribed from Liberty: A Journal of Anarchist Communism (June 1896) and Liberty: A Journal of Anarchist Communism (July 1896) on the Internet Archive.

 The question of how for Anarchist Communism agrees exactly with State Socialism, and the exact line that divides them, has long seemed to me one that it would be well to enter into. And just now, in view of the approaching International Congress, seems a time particularly appropriate for this consideration. For surely…</span>

Title: Colin Ward and the Art of Everyday Anarchy
Date: 2022
Notes: Routledge Studies in Radical History and Politics
Source: 

Colin Ward and the Art of Everyday Anarchy is the first full account of Ward’s life and work. Drawing on unseen archival sources, as well as oral interviews, it excavates the worlds and words of his anarchist thought, illuminating his methods and charting the legacies of his enduring influence. 
 Colin Ward (1924—2010) was the most prominent British writer on anarchism in the 20th century. As a radical journalist, later author, he applied his distinctive anarchist principles to all aspects of community life including the built environment, education, and public policy. His thought was subtle, universal in a…</span>

Title: And Yet It Moves (Updated Edition)
Subtitle: The Realization and Suppression of Science and Technology
Date: 1985
Notes: A situationist critique of science and technology published in New York in 1985. This version is a new edition that was published on the &#x27;Endangered Phoenix&#x27; website and credited to Phil Meyler. The Endangered Phoenix website is dead now, and I can’t find the updated version on the website through the wayback machine, so there are some footnotes and chapter heading levels which are unclear to me. Plus, I think chapter 3 &amp; 4 were merged in the updated edition, so chapter numbers went out of sync, but chapter 8 was still called chapter 8 which makes it seem like chapter 7 is missing on the libcom website. It is all very confusing, but …</span>

 In Freedom Anarchist Journal’s Winter 2023-2024 issue, Matthew Azoulay submitted an article introducing readers to Murray Bookchin’s ideas of the communalist assembly[1] which disturbed and surprised me for how much it was outdated.

The Political Capability of the Chinese People
 There are some who doubt that the Chinese people are capable of creating a truly democratic state. We emphatically disagree. The political environment in any country is created by its leaders. The perceptions and habits of the people can be changed to follow those of the leadership. Furthermore, Chinese society has been traditionally rich in self-governing organizations, which can be effectively used to reconstruct [China as] a democratic state.

 A characteristic of our time is that much is accomplished in spirit but little is accomplished in reality. Perhaps even the lack of actual implementation corresponds to a special activity of the mind, which constantly strives to overcome its own formations without leaving the form of fantasy and doctrine.

 As class-struggle anarchists dealing with the relations between gender, race and class, we must, in theory and practice, pick a path between two pitfalls. On one side is economic reductionism – the reduction of all political questions to the social relations of production – which erases the perspectives and struggles of women, queers and people of colour; submerges their voices within an overly generalised class narrative, in which the idealised Worker is implicitly white heterosexual and male; or consigns their struggles to a secondary importance compared to the “real struggle” of (economic) class against class. On the other is …</span>

                              <span>1. As employees return to the workplace post-pandemic, older debates about the purpose and design of offices are resurfacing. Can you give us a rundown of the origins of open offices? Large corporate offices emerged in the late 19th century as growing industrial businesses needed more administrative coordination. Companies wanted to have offices downtown, but  More

                              <span>There&#x27;s 2 genders, right? We all know that.
Of course there is. You&#x27;re either a bloke, who has the dangly bits between their legs, or you&#x27;re a woman without said dangly bits.
But maybe there&#x27;s more. Maybe you have the dangly bits, but it doesn&#x27;t feel right to call yourself a man? Maybe it&#x27;s the opposite? Or something in between?
Honestly, I don&#x27;t give a fuck. For all I care, you could identify as a potato and I&#x27;ll still respect your wishes. But getting pissed off at me if I mis-identify you is not cool.
Look, it&#x27;s a fucking minefield out there when it comes to people identifying as non-binary. We&#x27;ve been mincing about this planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and for most that time there&#x27;s been 2 genders. Male and female.
But in the last few decades there&#x27;s been a number of other genders that have sprung up. So if I think you look like a man, and I refer to you as &quot;him&quot; don&#x27;t get up on your high horse and start screaming &quot;YOU ASSUMED MY GENDER! NAZI!&quot;
I assumed your gender because you look like a fucking man. If you identify as something else, that&#x27;s fine. Tell me politely and I&#x27;ll happily respect your wishes. Live and let live, and all that. Makes no difference to me.
Irony is, if you&#x27;re not a dick about the whole thing, you&#x27;re far more likely to get people on-side. You&#x27;re always gonna get bigoted wankers, that&#x27;s par for the course. But just because someone makes a mistake, it doesn&#x27;t make them a bigot, or a transphobe, or a TERF, or a Nazi.
It just makes them human.
Peace ✌🏻

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently writing this post as a break from working on the comic I have due at the end of the month. It&#x27;s an eighteen-page oneshot and my very first contribution to an anthology, which is honestly very exciting. Intimidating, too, which is why I ended up putting off most of the work until the last minute.
Working on it has, as I anticipated, brought to light a number of my artistic weaknesses: I don&#x27;t like inking, I half-ass shapes I don&#x27;t understand rather than look for a reference, my faces are inconsistent... the list goes on. Seeing all the ways I fall short of my expectations is what I was afraid of happening, why I put it off for so long – but I don&#x27;t really have the time anymore to sit and nitpick at my work, which is kind of a blessing. Stuff is getting done!

                              <span>My throat hurts a little. I don’t know if this is because of the air quality here or because I’m actually getting sick, but I’m desperately hoping it’s not the latter. I stopped taking my immunosuppressants today and started drinking lots of juices high in vitamin C, despite research proving chugging OJ a rather ineffective method for warding off illness. (Something about all the sugar in it makes it hard for your body to absorb the Vitamin C, if I remember correctly.)
Traveling and getting sick go hand in hand for me. It’s as if arriving somewhere new triggers my immune system to self-immolate. When I visited New York in 2021 I lost my voice after a few days. I spent my first week in Latin America making chicken noodle soup and nursing myself back to health. My immune system’s never been …</span>

                              <span>I never really thought about it while growing up because I was raised in a religious family anyway and it&#x27;s just how I was used to people talking, but at this point I&#x27;ve been living in Japan for several years and I often notice that very normal phrases take on a religious persona when translated to English. For example we have this word yokatta which literally translates as &quot;it was good&quot;, but if you were to translate it normally to English as it&#x27;s used than it would come out as &quot;thank God&quot;. Or we have this other word kotoka which would be translated as &quot;God knows&quot; like &quot;God only knows how bored I am&quot; (なんて暇なことか). Also a lot of words in English are shortened versions of old phrases with religious significance like &quot;Goodbye&quot; coming from &quot;God be with ye&quot;, and a lot of set phrases or common expressions in English that people use all the time come straight from the Bible like &quot;a drop in the bucket&quot;, &quot;go the extra mile&quot;, &quot;by the skin of your teeth&quot;, &quot;the root of the matter&quot;, &quot;a labor of love&quot;, &quot;scapegoat&quot;, &quot;broken heart&quot;, &quot;eye for an eye&quot;, &quot;rise and shine&quot;, &quot;fall by the wayside&quot;, or &quot;a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;
I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a bad thing (and I don&#x27;t think it is), and Japanese has a lot of similar words or phrases which come from a religious origin too. It&#x27;s just kinda weird to notice in retrospect how in English-speaking countries everything is experienced through a Judeo-Christian lens, even if you&#x27;re an atheist.
Maybe that&#x27;s why Western society and Japanese society are so different. Or partly why, anyway.</span>

                              <span>Fully onchain games are the only &quot;web3 games&quot; that I find interesting or worthwhile.
Like many of you, I have always been a gamer and have spent tens of thousands of hours exploring in-game worlds. These days, I&#x27;m too busy with my full-time job (helping people build interesting products using blockchains) to play much, and I tend to spend more time consuming content about games than playing them. I barely ever beat/100% a game like I used to. I still find myself driven to the aura that surrounds a game, often comprising of lore, community, roleplaying, extensive multi-party discussion and the creation of adjacent media.
I understand that this opening statement might be controversial, but I have seen enough of the behind-the-scenes of web3 gaming (or its name-of-the-month; I&#x27;m glad we dropp…</span>

                              <span>Open AI released a new update. You can now talk to your computers just like a human. Low latency. More responsive. It got me thinking about how I talk to computers.
The way I do it is more intimate. I am a low-level programmer. I write firmware code in c mostly. I think about the hardware that runs my code more than the average programmer. Yet if it was the 1980&#x27;s I would be a very high-level programmer. The assembly lang bros will look at me with contempt the same way I look at the python bros. The thought alone makes me shiver.
How we talk to computers has evolved. So many great engineers built the infrastructure that I use today to turn my c code into machine code. From the libraries, the operating system, and the compiler. There is a sort of deterministic heuristic-based intelligence b…</span>

                              <span>i know, kind of random. 

these days, kids in the region where i live get chromebooks at school. 

many of my students, including the ones who are now in middle school, are not efficient typers, and in fact many of them are slamming their pointer fingers down on keys one by one, the younger ones not even remembering where any of the letters are even after countless repetitions of the same words. 

and don&#x27;t even get me started on their spelling skills. 
choice, import, and scissors, although i&#x27;ll cut some of the younger ones slack on scissors. 

something else i find pretty funny is that occasionally they&#x27;ll try to touch the screen on the desktop to navigate. 

and this is all coming from an area where many of the school districts are top in the nation. 

did you also know that kids nowadays are more susceptible to online scams and malware? 

and overall, kids throughout the nation are reading at a significantly lower level than they should be, even with schooling. 

that&#x27;s it from me, thanks for reading my rant:)</span>

My late uncle’s wife and daughter (my cousin) kindly joined us too. I mentioned how much I wanted to see my cousin in an earlier post. When we went to my uncle’s apartment with strawberries in hand to visit her I felt bad seeing the eye bags and stress lines written all over their face. In spite of all that, they invited us in and told us their side of the story while shedding tears. The details of his precipitously declining health and death were gruesome; I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying. I can’t imagine the whirlwind of emotions the last month has been for them.
That said, I was still really glad to see my…</span>

Almost two weeks ago, I wrote about catching a crawfish in the pond near Jiaozi Park, not far from where I live. My wife and I weren&#x27;t sure what to do - whether we should put it back or keep it. Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.
I&#x27;m happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We&#x27;ve noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It&#x27;s no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we&#x27;re nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.
We&#x27;re trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well. I&#x27;ll provide more updates as things progress.</span>

 Anarchists over the course of history have never had a unified stance on Palestine and Zionism. 
 Some Jewish anarchists active in the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as Bernard Lazare and Hillel Solotaroff, drifted toward Zionism over time (as noted by Mina Grauer in an article from 1994). 
 In 1906, Jewish anarchist Emma Goldman published an pseudonymously-authored article by a fellow Jewish anarchist which criticized Zionism, as well as nationalism more generally, and claimed that &quot;Prejudices are never overcome by one who shows himself equally narrow and bigoted.…</span>

 The tragic events in Palestine have provided yet another happy hunting ground for Mussolini. 
 The Press announces that Arab notabilities in Lybia have sent a message to Mussolini reaffirming their solidarity with the Arabs in Palestine. This message naturally comes as a result of Mussolini’s fine words when he called himself the “defender of Islam.” On the other hand Alfred Roke, a member of the Arab Higher Committee declared to Arthur Koestler, News Chronicle special correspondent that he was expressing the opinion of the Committee, including the Mufti, w…</span>

Wu Zhihui’s Letter
 On April 29, 1924, Wu Zhihui wrote Chen Jiongming a long letter from Shanghai, in which he argued the necessity of a Chen-Sun reconciliation to save the country from disintegration.

 The happiness of full equality is not the kind of false hope that Heaven will automatically bless every single soul on earth. Rather, it gives the human spirit the opportunity for regeneration. If we want to realize this happiness of equality and the opportunity for spiritual regeneration, there is no need for us to do any more searching.

There is not a whole lot to do here. With my uncle gone there’s no one to take us out; while healthy, my grandparents can’t walk for very long and neither can my mom. My brother and I are useless on our own. We don’t have a data plan, can’t pay for anything because we don’t have WeChat pay set up (I think you need a Chinese bank account), and can’t even download an offline map to help us get around. If we do go out on our own we’ll have to retrace our steps by memory.

Title: Fringe Benefits
Date: 17 June 1988 — 3 May 1996
Notes: Colin Ward’s weekly column in the journal New Statesman and Society called Fringe Benefits. Many of the titles should be read as having the words ‘Fringe Benefits:’ before it, so ‘Fringe Benefits: Back Pages’, i.e. the fringe benefits of back pages.

Title: The Head of SAC: Tesla Faces a ‘Stalemate’ in Sweden as the Longest Strike in Decades Grinds On

 Workers at Swedish service centers and dealerships of the company Tesla, best known for its electric vehicles and its celebrity billionaire owner Elon Musk, have been on strike for over five months now. The strike, which started on October 27, 2023, is the longest one in Sweden in over eighty years. 
 The strike is led by the metal workers’ union IF Metall. IF Metall is not known to be a particularly combative union. Before the Tesla conflict, no IF Metall worker had been on strike fo…</span>

Title: And Yet It Moves
Subtitle: The Realization and Suppression of Science and Technology
Date: 1985
Notes: A situationist critique of science and technology published in New York in 1985. The scan of the original edition had pages 31 or 32 &amp; 34 missing, so text has been added from the updated edition, but ideally the original text will be found and re-added. So, text has been added between (1) &quot;caught up in an adversary&quot; and &quot;to assert itself over the cult of science&quot;, plus between (2) &quot;the terrain of pseudo-progressiveness&quot; and &quot;Chapter 2: The Informed Informer&quot;.

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

Hank and John Green: Nerdfighteria is my internet home.
WaitButWhy: Deep dives into topics from first principles and cool sticky figures. Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.
Brandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.
Staring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.
LessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.
Richard Feynman&#x27;s Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
