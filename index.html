                              <span>Code reviews are supposed to be about improving code quality and sharing knowledge, but when PR comments start hitting the hundreds, something is very wrong. I’ve recently come across a discussion where a new developer joined a team and faced over 300 PR comments on their first contribution. Most of it was stylistic nitpicking. This isn’t just unproductive, it’s outright toxic.
Why This Happens
You’re Not Using Linters or Auto-Formatters
Prettier, ESLint, or Black exist for a reason. Not automating this is borderline malpractice in modern development.
Your Team Has a &quot;Style Over Substance&quot; Obsession
Metrics Gone Wild
Toxic Culture
What Needs to Change
Automate the Trivial Stuff
Focus on What Matters
Define (and Stick To) a Style Guide
Measure the Right Things
Stop Wasting Everyone’s Time
Hundreds of comments on a PR are a red flag, not a badge of honor. It means your process is broken. Fix the culture, fix the tooling, and focus on what actually matters: shipping high-quality, maintainable software. Anything else is just noise.</span>

                              <span>Twenty-five years ago this week, the streets of Seattle erupted into the kind of militant protest rarely seen in the US. Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink&#x27;s anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom. More

You need only scan those President-Elect Donald Trump has given key governmental positions: Private Predators, on and offline, with an animus to laws and the bureaucracy that enforces them. This subjugation of the many by the few comes as no surprise as such has always been part of “winning” in “The American Dream” as well as the force behind “American Exceptionalism.” Egalitarianism has always been the soft and fuzzy dream of useful idiots, in the eyes of the Winners.

                              <span>With over 2,300,000 renters in New York City, it’s a good bet most of them had to pay exorbitant brokers’ fees to land their apartments. Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

                              <span>Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.
Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying &quot;FBO&quot; accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer&#x27;s balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse&#x27;s case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I&#x27;m willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.
FWIW, after seeing &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;, I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.

I still live in the house where he grew up, and he enjoys these nostalgic returns. After we got home from the airport yesterday, he went for a run. He came home to report that he&#x27;d passed the homes of old friends, the middle school he attended, and various spots where he&#x27;s committed various teenage sins in his wayward youth.
A little later, we went to the train station to pick up his daughter, our granddaughter, who was traveling to meet us from Virginia, where she attends school. We all went out for a sushi feast before coming home to hang out, telling stories, and making each other laugh.

                              <span>They are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.
&gt; All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]
&gt; So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.

Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this.</span>

                              <span>I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate “cloud shit”, and a small part of me is convinced that literally no one actually likes it, and everyone is playing a joke on me.
I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.
I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.
If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.</span>

So...I&#x27;m supposed to be on my DevOps arc, but here I am writing a piece on Low Level programming! The pull to this path is too strong, I can&#x27;t fight it..I&#x27;ll get back to DevOps by the end of the week, I promise!
Autograd
There are great references on Autograd:
Pytorch Autograd: text and video.
Medium article
Taken from Pytorch&#x27;s website:
PyTorch’s Autograd feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as gradients) over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.
Machine Learning in general use case.
Machine Learning has been proven to be highly useful in variety of sectors:

此文就是记录从我调研到购买和使用的一系列功课的汇总，如果你也桌备购入，希望能够帮助到你。
购前
🤔 如果你要使用 Apple TV 就意味着……
在中国大陆地区，想要使用 Apple TV 还是需要一些技巧的，这里作为前提先列出来：
一个 Apple ID（为了体验最大化，并不推荐使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID）；
一台电视或一台显示器；
流畅的网络环境（为了体验最大化，最好是比较科学的网络条件）；
一条 HDMI2.0/2.1 连接线（随包装不会附赠）；
接下来，我会逐一讲解上述因素。
🍎 Apple ID
使用 Apple 设备和服务的基础因素。这里需要注意的是，由于Apple TV 并没有正式在中国大陆地区销售，并不推荐你使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 进行登录和使用，因为体验会收到最大程度的折损。
使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 登录时，Apple TV 将没有 App Store ，无法下载新的 App。同时预装的 Apple Music 也不会显示，即使该 Apple ID 已经订阅了中国大陆地区的 Apple Music 亦无法使用相关功能。但是，若先用其他地区的 Apple ID 登录，并在 APP Store 下载第三方 APP，再切换回中国大陆地区的 Apple ID，则已下载的第三方 APP 仍会保留。
所以，如果你想要正常体验 Apple TV 的原生各项服务，下载并享受其他第三方 App，请使用非大陆地区 Apple ID，我个人推荐使用美区 Apple ID。
📺 显示器/电视
最推荐的当然是一台电视，如果你有足够大的空间的话。否则，一台合适尺寸的显示器也是可以的。比较理想的是一台支持杜比视界的 4k 电视/显…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been happily using an iPhone 8 for the last 7 years. It has been, and still is, a perfect smartphone. I&#x27;ve never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I&#x27;ve never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.
About a year ago the battery wasn&#x27;t making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.
But then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device&#x27;s release date1. So I&#x27;m stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.
And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly fun…</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

Well... I would be remiss if I didn’t talk about an important life event.
Yesterday marked Cocoa’s 2nd year of life— not her 2nd birthday, but the 2-year anniversary of when the universe (or choose your own higher being) gave us more time with her.
Let’s rewind a bit.
Thanksgiving 2022. We just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner and were relaxing, watching TV. Cocoa was lying on the couch when she suddenly started dry heaving, as if trying to throw up but with nothing to expel.
Strange.
We took her outside. She was on and off dry heaving. Nothing was coming out. Maybe she wanted to go use the bathroom. She walked very slowly, something clearly off. We brought her back inside, her little body feeling so tender.
She wasn…</span>

                              <span>我的公司距离我的家有 17km 距离，所以我每天会花单程 30-40mins 的时间开车通勤。今天简单说说我怎么度过这每天一个多小时的时间。
🎵 听音乐
通勤时间总是无聊的，我最早的时候是听歌。但是我这个人有一个毛病，很难听得进去新歌，但是我的收藏列表我又听烂了。所以现在通勤路上听音乐的频率较少，也会，但不多。
📻 听播客
我个人很喜欢听播客，不光在通勤的时候会听。但是我又很挑，对于信息和内容输出质量很低的播客我极少收听。所以我有一个白名单，一旦白名单的播客更新，我才会考虑听。所以，不会每天有一个小时的可收听量。
📚 听书
这个是我最近半个月养成的新习惯，起因是我在一些播客中听到过一些书籍的分享，但是我又没有很好的建立起读新书的习惯，所以我就瞅准了通勤这段时间。恰好微信读书又有听书模式，如果你是付费会员，可以想听歌一样的听书。这简直是一举多得，解决了我通勤路上恰好收听内容不足的隐患，又拓展了「阅读量」，还能完成微信读书的任务。

▲ 阅读了 13 天的成果
关于微信读书我准备后面找时间专门写一篇有趣的观察和思考，作为产品分析吧。
💬 总结
综上所述，我现在通勤路上依然会听歌和听播客，听歌比较少，听播客比听音乐稍多。这两者的区别在于听歌可以随时开播，听播客我需要提前甄选一下听的内容。如果两者都不想实施，我使用了微信读书的听书来补齐，这样又可以在这个通勤的时间段内拓展出一个内容输入的渠道。可喜可贺。</span>

It&#x27;s not just a loss for society.  It&#x27;s society-killing.
Taking resources away from those who move society forward and spending them on those who are unlikely to &quot;pay it back&quot; is a way your culture dies.  Conquerers in the past used this strategy to win massive empires for themselves.  It&#x27;s a ridiculous self-own.

                              <span>It’s not just California, but California may be one of the more egregious state neglecters.
The push at the state level for policies that focus on equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities will not end well for the gifted and talented communities.
Whenever I hear these people talk about their policies, I can’t help but recall Harrison Bergeron.
Focusing on equality of outcomes in a society that structurally does not afford equality of opportunities is a fool’s game that ends with Bergeron-esque levels of absurdity.
Imho, the only viable/main solution is to acknowledge that we all aren’t equal, we don’t all have access to the same opportunities, but as a country we can implement policies that lessen the imbalance.
Head Start is a good example.
Well-run gifted and talented programs in schools are also good examples.
Killing truly progressive programs for the purpose of virtue signaling is a loss for society.</span>

                              <span>&gt;I wonder if you exclude &quot;recalls&quot; resolved by software updates, for all cars, where it would rank then?
Why have you put &quot;recalls&quot; in quotes?  It gives the impression you think this makes it somehow lesser.  The cybertruck, for example, was subject to a recall because the rearview camera wouldn&#x27;t come up, but the mirrors are insufficient to back the vehicle up safely without the camera.
That&#x27;s a safety issue, irrespective of whether or not the fix was in software.</span>

                              <span>Stack Overflow&#x27;s traffic has been in decline, and the convenient narrative is to blame it on LLMs.
However, I think developers were already looking for reasons to stop interacting with Stack Overflow. LLMs have massive blind spots. New framework releases, yesterday&#x27;s OS update, and niche languages are not in LLM training data. These are the problems where Stack Overflow should shine over AI. Yet traffic is declining even in these areas.
I recently found myself caught between these two worlds, trying to solve a problem too new for LLMs, but running into the exact community issues driving people away from Stack Overflow. My experience might shed some light on why developers are leaving, even when AI can&#x27;t help them.

                              <span>After a two-month writing hiatus, I&#x27;m back to share my recent adventure: moving back to Japan.
Two weeks ago, I left my croupier job in Estonia, moved back to Japan and already achieved one of my long-standing dreams – settling into a charming two-story house with a garden. My plan is to transform this outdoor space into a green haven, with lemon trees and herb-filled pots(Yes I love lemon trees a lot and fortunately there are lemon trees everywhere around my neighborhood). The house was completely empty when I moved in, so I&#x27;m gradually acquiring basic appliances to make it feel like home.
Transportation here presented an interesting challenge. While a car is essential in the countryside, my current financial situation – thanks to the loans I took for this journey – means I&#x27;ve opted for a bicycle. I purchased a Giant Escape for around 70,000 yen and will be commuting 5km each way, a distance familiar from my university days.
This isn&#x27;t my first time in Japan, but living in the countryside as a foreigner feels like a unique privilege. The locals are incredibly welcoming. While I&#x27;m visibly different – a bearded foreigner in a small Japanese city – I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the warm interactions. Elders, children, and dog owners are particularly friendly, often greeting me with enthusiastic &quot;konnichiwa&quot;s.
My ability to speak Japanese fluently is making a big difference, of course. In this small city, encountering a Turk who speaks Japanese at an advanced level is not something locals experience everyday. Whenever I need assistance, people go out of their way to help me, which I deeply appreciate.
My professional journey is just beginning. Starting December 2nd, I&#x27;ll join a new workplace where I&#x27;ve already met most of my colleagues. Contrary to stereotypes about Japanese companies, my new team is quite supportive and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m really lucky to have found such an environment, and I&#x27;m hopeful about building a long-term community here.</span>

Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, I&#x27;m just observing a theme on here. Sometimes I can feel out of my depth here with it all, I only know basic html and although I do code, it&#x27;s in R (woo lets go statistics). Just sometimes I can feel a bit lonely on here browsing etc because none of my hobbies or pursuits have been reflected on here as of yet :0. Any other earth science ppl out there ?Maybe this is a nothing burger post but whatever</span>

                              <span>Last week, I wrote a post about how I wanted to add a friction between myself and getting online. I was curious to see how it would affect my mental health as well the amount of time I spend online. Things didn’t exactly go to plan, but I did come away with some interesting take aways and some ideas on how I want to proceed in the future.
The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine. I didn’t respond to any, because I prefer to type on a real keyboard, but it helped me keep track of some Amazon orders as well as a few other things I had goi…</span>

                              <span>As I strolled through yet another city on a mid-week trip, I came across a cozy-looking coffee shop. Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today&#x27;s newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I&#x27;ve always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.

                              <span>It&#x27;s important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it&#x27;s no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado&#x27;s thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.
Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.</span>

                              <span>I compile a lot of C++ code from a lot of places, and the only time I run into code that somehow simply doesn&#x27;t work on newer versions of C++ and where the developers aren&#x27;t even sure if they will accept any patches to fix the issue as they claim it &quot;isn&#x27;t supported&quot; to use a newer version of C++--even for the public headers of a library--is, you guessed it: code from Google.
Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call &quot;modern&quot;, and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it&#x27;s 10% of Denmark&#x27;s total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it&#x27;s actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.

Hosting blobs is one of those things that will inevitably go through iterations as we understand the abuse vectors more and more, but for now it&#x27;s really fun to see this kind of usage in action.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn&#x27;t drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don&#x27;t need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.</span>

                              <span>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve worked at multiple places that ran shell scripts just fine for their deploys.
- One had only 2 services [php] and ran over 1 billion requests a day. Deploy was trivial, ssh some new files to the server and run a migration, 0 downtime.
- One was in an industry that didn&#x27;t need &quot;Webscale&quot; (retirement accounts). Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.
Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.
The place I&#x27;m at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total). It has one shared test environment that it takes 3-hours to see your changes in.
I don&#x27;t fault kubernetes directly, I fault the overall complexity. But at the end of the day kubernetes feels like complexity trying to abstract over complexity, and often I find that&#x27;s less successful that removing complexity in the first place.</span>

 ‘Anarchists in the Blind Spot’ has the posture of a disappointed lover who didn’t make it into their songwriter ex’s latest LP. None of the songs are about them, so they leave a scathing review. 
 The anonymous author argues that Yintah should have included the history of anarchist participation in the Wet’suwet’en struggle. I agree that the film is incomplete witho…</span>

                              <span>重新开始公开写日记。
Why
前一段时间发现自己在浑噩过日子，并不是像一具行尸走肉，而是缺少自律的可持续的沉淀过程。熟悉我的朋友可能知道，我运营了一个名叫不求甚解的 Telegram 频道，这是我的得意之作，也是我的心头之痛。为什么这么讲，得意的是因为我在运营这个介质的同时获得了诸多关注和肯定，难过的是我经常缺少更新它的动力。
但是我经常思考。是的，作为一个 INTJ-A，我是非常喜欢思考，人生经历了 30 多年，到达了现在的阶段，我已经养成了时刻思考的能力和习惯，但是我缺少系统化沉淀的动作。
所以，我准备开启我人生的新阶段 ———— 养成自律的思考到沉淀的链路。
How
我准备按照时间周期的维度产出一些内容：
[Daily] 每天在这里写日记，哪怕是流水账；
[Weekly] Telegram 频道一周至少 3 更；
[Monthly] 召集思想同频的小伙伴录制播客。
Specially
需要说明几点，以上产出的内容，都是为了我自己，如果能帮助到此刻正在看的你，我很荣幸，但这不是我的职责以及初心。
最后，除了上面那些看起来很高大上的原因外，另外一个让我开始想要系统化记录自己生活的原因，是因为我看到了我的朋友 61 正在这么做，能够通过他的内容中感受到他对生活的热爱以及快乐，我也同样需要这些。
以上，祝各位都好。</span>

                              <span>A contradictory title from someone who lives in a country that is among the world&#x27;s largest coffee consumers, and who loves a Swedish fika.
The title, of course, refers to the &quot;Buy Me a Coffee&quot; buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it&#x27;s often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn&#x27;t feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian &quot;jantelagen&quot; (Law of Jante). I don&#x27;t know.
I don&#x27;t blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it&#x27;s nice to know that I don&#x27;t &quot;have to.&quot; And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you&#x27;re ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I&#x27;ll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️</span>

                              <span>I agree with you that&#x27;s how it should be, but experience tells me that everyone is insecure and it&#x27;s hardly correlated with position and job security.
People lower down the chain are insecure because they could legitimately be let go at any time for any reason.
People higher up the chain are insecure because any loss of face is debilitating. Especially having failings pointed out by someone &quot;below&quot; them.</span>

                              <span>Astonishing. Completely backwards. This article describes how to give feedback to your subordinates, not to your superiors. If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it&#x27;s feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don&#x27;t bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.
The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don&#x27;t yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.
The reason you don&#x27;t fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.</span>

Once you could use a sleek, trendy iPhone instead of a clunky desktop computer to get online, the writing was on the wall.
Technology changes, people don&#x27;t.</span>
