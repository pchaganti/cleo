 They place themselves entirely in the future and, taking collective property as their point of departure, discover that there is no longer any good reason to be concerned with the right of inheritance.

Our position on the war in Ukraine
“Autonomous Action” is not on the side of the Ukrainian state — and not on the side of any other state. However, in the current circumstances, the victory of Russia is not beneficial to the peoples of neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor Belarus. Fighting against Russian aggression is now beneficial to everyone except the Kremlin. It is easy to see why it is beneficial to the Ukrainian authorities. But why is it also beneficial to people (and, accordingly…</span>

 Born in 2013, WARZONE DISTRO free zine project, stands at the intersection of nihilist, anti-civilization anarchy, and total liberation, bridging gaps between veganism, straight edge, and insurrectionary thought. WARZONE DISTRO is dedicated to challenging the very foundations of oppression, wherever it festers, and in whatever form. 
 In our interview below, we delve into the radical philosophy driving WARZONE DISTRO, exploring how they blend anarchist and vegan ideals to craft a vision of true total liberation. We talk about the unique ch…</span>

 Along the horridly neglected path out of being commanded and subjected, from the stinking bowels of the societies of oiled gears, permanent emissions, bright screens, information haze and ceaseless masturbation to worn-out sensibility, there arises a shrill hissing of such stupid nature, of such whining entitlement, that the lone rebel catches herself snickering — then nearly dying laughing . . . 
 &quot;You have a left-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a right-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a centrist bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have an extremist bias!&quot; 
 Ha! Ahahaha! Ah, the acrid hell of human hubris knows no end! The sheer closeness in conceptual capacity to being god — yet holding oneself back at the last second …</span>

 “Modernity as a concept means time, the present. There are different moderns, depending on the age. From Sumerian modernity to Roman modernity, and even before and after them, there have been…many examples of modernity.” 
 Abdullah Öcalan, The Sociology of Freedom
 “The Negro’s revolutionary history is rich, inspiring, and unknown. Negroes revolted against the slave raiders in Africa; they revolted against the slave traders on the Atlantic passage. They revolted on the plantations. The docile Negro is a myth… The only place where Negroes did not revolt is in the pages of capitalist historians.”

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursi…</span>

                              <span>This post will be very plain. That is because Bear Blog is excellent in a way that is obvious and requires little explaining.  Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.
It pleases me that Bear Blog doesn&#x27;t have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals. In fact, if you look at its roadmap, you will notice that…</span>

The site then sat there and did nothing, but that was fine, because I didn&#x27;t need to have an actual blog, I had cohost1 for any kind of longer-than-a-tweet writing I wanted to do.
Then two things happened.
First, I got nervous about social media. I feel weird about the way it works and the kind of interaction it encourages, and especially the way endless feeds hijack my ADHD brain. I decided to put all my accounts essentially on hold, including my cohost, and not post for a while, figuring I&#x27;d come back eventually. In the mean time, maybe I&#x27;d start blogging again?

                              <span>My work life is on a precipice; we are shortly moving into another building in another part of the city, to consolidate with another. This building has been tentatively sold, and the new building was recently renovated (and being renovated again, to accommodate studio space) and is much nicer. There will be more people there, a complete change from the silent hallways of the current building.
But this building wasn&#x27;t always this way. At one point it was tough to get a parking spot, and you had to park in a city-owned gravel parking lot next door until something opened up. But many rounds of layoffs has emptied out the building - there are barely 10 people on the first floor alone on a good day. It&#x27;s quiet, and I&#x27;ve grown used to it.
The new building? It&#x27;s quiet-ish, but there are definitel…</span>

                              <span>I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).
And then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.
Ever since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.
Yesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.
Although I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.
It was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.
And if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.

                              <span>My oldest daughter is a certified registered nurse anesthetist, a former NICU nurse, a business owner helping people with medication resistant depression, the mother of two and has been happily married for 18 years. She is a success by every definition of the word. She figured out her own education to include its financing and her housing situation all on her own after graduating from high school early. She has regularly been involved on lobbying the state legislature on health care issues. For fun, she raises laying hens, gardens and still has time to keep up with the rest of our family. She is amazing.
I was looking through some of my old writing recently and I found this character sketch I wrote about her when she was in middle school. She was a high energy kiddo, to say the least. She …</span>

                              <span>Part of the reason I sadly stopped running any exit nodes was law enforcement harassment.
I ran a few exits for about about ~5 years. In those 5 years, my hosting provider (DigitalOcean) received 3 subpoenas for my account information.
The first two were random. The 1st one was someone sent a bomb threat email to a university. The 2nd one was someone sending a phishing email.
The last and final subpoena was the most serious one. Some nation-state hackers from Qatar had ended up using my exit IP to break into some email accounts belonging to people they were interested in and spied upon them and stole some info.
Thankfully both the Tor Project and the EFF were able to help me pro-bono. The EFF lawyer that was assigned to me helped me fight this subpoena but ultimately we had to turn over my account information to the DOJ + I had to give an affidavit stating that I was simply just an operator and nothing on the server in question would be useful to their investigation (by design).
The stress of having to deal with law enforcement, lawyers, and having to entertain the possibility of having my home raided over something so silly ultimately led to me finally shutting down my exits.
Even though I had all of my exits using a reduced exit policy and I would blacklist known malicious IPs and c2/malware infra from being able to use it, I was still a target.
I feel law enforcement realizes this is a big weakness they can target since a lot of Tor exit operators are individuals with not a lot of resources to fight them. They can use the legal system to scare operators into shutting down.
I one day hope to resume running exits as I find it rewarding to be able to help people from around the world in a small way.</span>

                              <span>For non-EU readers, note that taxation is explicitly not a competency of the EU (i.e. Ireland can set its tax levels to whatever it wants). The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn&#x27;t, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists.</span>

Abstract
 The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…</span>

Title: Anarchists Against Counter-Revolution

 There has been a disturbing trend within anarchism in the last few years. It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. 
 The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently &#x27;anarchist.&#x27; 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to &#x27;anarchist&#x27; batt…</span>

 Note: The present passage was written on 11-16 December 2002 (period of the Cyprus entry into the European Union) by anarchist prisoner Giorgos Garakasian in the jails of free Cypriot democracy. 
 Through the general secretary of United Criminals Kofi Annan the Americans and British have been attempting for some time now to impose a ‘fair and viable solution’ upon the inhabitants of Cyprus. 
 The period that we are living in is characterized by the reorganization of global dominion, which has completed its first phase of ‘anti-terrorist’ hysteria with the devastating intervention in Afgha…</span>

There&#x27;s no excuse for an appliance to brick itself or lose functionality just because of the manufacturer&#x27;s remote action. When I buy a device, I don&#x27;t want a perpetual, tethered relationship with the manufacturer in order to work the device. I don&#x27;t want it to ask the manufacturer for permission to run every day. I don&#x27;t want it to be dependent on the manufacturer to keep it alive. I don&#x27;t want to create an account. I don&#x27;t want to log in to the manufacturer&#x27;s servers. I don&#x27;t want them to know my IP address or my home address. Leave me alone, I&#x27;m just not that into you!
A hardware device should work on day 10,000 just as it worked on day 1. If you as a company can&#x27;t do that, you should not be able to sell the device (EDIT: OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as &quot;dependent on the manufacturer&#x27;s servers&quot;)</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know that I completely agree. To some degree, sure — most folks probably don&#x27;t notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.
But my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she&#x27;d have no idea what the term &quot;continuity&quot; means in this context. She notices that it&#x27;s easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it&#x27;s so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there&#x27;s very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn&#x27;t need to write down passwords anymore.
I think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don&#x27;t have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity — long before my mother did — it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I&#x27;m a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.
I&#x27;m also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they&#x27;re switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.</span>

                              <span>&gt; If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.
Battery replacement costs at Apple are $69-99 and offered all the way back to the iPhone SE 1st Generation. That&#x27;s the all-in cost where you bring it in, they open it up, swap it out, and give your phone back to you.
An OEM battery for an Android phone is like $50.
Budgeting $69-99 once every 3-4 years hardly seems like it&#x27;s going to nuke their business from orbit.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m conflicted.
It&#x27;s absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models &quot;boring&quot;.
The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I&#x27;ll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.
She can&#x27;t tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.
You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back.
You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn&#x27;t notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn&#x27;t know they even exist.
All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.
You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she&#x27;s highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It&#x27;s not that she&#x27;s unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn&#x27;t care.
It&#x27;s becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.
I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don&#x27;t buy the pro and they&#x27;re desperate for selling points in the regular model.
If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.</span>

                              <span>You sound like you&#x27;re proud of this work and this plan and this sequence of events.
code.google going away, without the excuse that google itself was going away, after I had started to rely on it and link to it in docs and scripts all over the place, is what taught me to never depend on google for anything.
If google had said &quot;The purpose of this service is an academic goal of Googles, not to serve users needs. This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.&quot; I would not have used it.
But Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.
Do you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it&#x27;s own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn&#x27;t even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.
So thanks for all your work making the world a better place.</span>

notes:
- photos/album search now includes video understanding, which imo seems very good from the first 2 examples they showed. includes scroll to exact time of the moment you describe.
- Mail and Notifications will show summaries instead of str[:x]
- Siri now knows iPhone, becomes the ultimate manual on how to use the increasingly complicated iOS 18. and can read your texts (!) to suggest actions with Personal Context Understanding (also it will try to advertise apple tv shows to you... i&#x27;m SURE it will be totally objective and aligned to your preferences amirite)
- new iphone 16 camera control button is PRIME real estate - notice how OpenAI/ChatGPT is now next to Google search, and both are secondary clicks to Apple&#x27;s visual search, which comes first
- camera adds events to calendar!
- &quot;all done on device&quot; and on cloud (though craig doesnt say that haha)
overall i think insanely good ideas on ai + phone integrations.</span>

Is anyone here actually excited about the features they just announced? Or are people simply upgrading because they get the latest iPhone every year or two by default?</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s a good article. The whole history is there.
The commercial side has made huge progress, too. Look up &quot;diamond making machine&quot; on Alibaba. You can buy a high-pressure, high temperature six sided press for about US$200,000. A chemical vapor deposition machine is about the same price.
De Beers, the diamond cartel, has an R&amp;D operation, Element Six. They sell synthetic diamonds for lasers and other exotic applications. The technology is good enough to achieve flaw levels in the parts per billion range, and to make diamond windows for lasers 10cm across.[1]
This is way above jewelry grade.
Over on the natural diamond side, there&#x27;s been a breakthrough. The industry used to break up some large diamonds during rock crushing. Now there&#x27;s a industrial X-ray system which is used to examine rocks before crushing to find diamonds. It&#x27;s working quite well. A 2500 carat diamond was found recently.[1][2] TOMRA, which makes high-volume sorters for everything from recyclables to rice, has a sorter for this job. This is working so well that there&#x27;s now something of a glut of giant diamonds too big for jewelry.
The finishing processes of cutting and polishing have been automated. The machinery for that comes mostly from China and India.
Diamonds are now something you can buy by the kilo, in plastic bags.

Don&#x27;t think about it. If you happen to notice it, try to distract yourself immediately. There maybe legitimate hearing damage but for the psychological aspect, the more you think about it the worse it becomes. I think I saw a quora answer somewhere where the doctor said &quot;Nobody complains about tinnitus while playing Playstation&quot;. And it&#x27;s very true.

This articles about the open source distribution side but I will also point out that the number of developers who don’t realise your remote GitHub repo can be located on any machine with an ssh connection and nothing more is surprising. As in people use private GitHub repos thinking that’s THE way you work with git. If GitHub was just for open source hosting I suspect they’d have trouble monetising like sourceforge clearly did which led to scammy attempts to make money. But they always had this huge usage of private GitHub repos supporting the rest. This must have helped a lot imho.</span>

                              <span>Actually, Google Code was never trying to win.
It was simply trying to prevent SF from becoming a shitty monoculture that hurt everyone, which it was when Google Code launched.  Google was 100% consistent on this from the day it launched to the day it folded. It was not trying to make money, or whatever
I was there, working on it, when it was 4 of us :)
So to write all these funny things about taste or what not, is totally besides the point.
We folded it up because we achieved the goal we sought at the time, and didn&#x27;t see a reason to continue.
People could get a good experience with the competition that now existed, and we would have just ended up cannibalizing the market.
So we chose to exit, and worked with Github/bitbucket/others to provide migration tools.
All of this would have been easy to find out simply by asking, but it appears nobody bothers to actually ask other people things anymore, and I guess that doesn&#x27;t make as good a story as &quot;we totally destroyed them because they had no taste, so they up and folded&quot;.</span>

                              <span>There are a number of concrete problems:
- syscall interfaces are a mess, the primitive APIs are too slow for regular sized packets (~1500 bytes), the overhead is too high. GSO helps but it’s a horrible API, and it’s been buggy even lately due to complexity and poor code standards.
- the syscall costs got even higher with spectre mitigation - and this story likely isn’t over. We need a replacement for the BSD sockets / POSIX APIs they’re terrible this decade. Yes, uring is fancy, but there’s a tutorial level API middle ground possible that should be safe and 10x less overhead without resorting to uring level complexity.
- system udp buffers are far too small by default - they’re much much smaller than their tcp siblings, essentially no one but experts have been using them, and experts just retune stuff.
- udp stack optimizations are possible (such as possible route lookup reuse without connect(2)), gso demonstrates this, though as noted above gso is highly fallible, quite expensive itself, and the design is wholly unnecessarily intricate for what we need, particularly as we want to do this safely from unprivileged userspace.
- several optimizations currently available only work at low/mid-scale, such as connect binding to (potentially) avoid route lookups / GSO only being applicable on a socket without high peer-competition (competing peers result in short offload chains due to single-peer constraints, eroding the overhead wins).
Despite all this, you can implement GSO and get substantial performance improvements, we (tailscale) have on Linux. There will be a need at some point for platforms to increase platform side buffer sizes for lower end systems, high load/concurrency, bdp and so on, but buffers and congestion control are a high complex and sometimes quite sensitive topic - nonetheless, when you have many applications doing this (presumed future state), there will be a need.</span>

You might also get a lot of mockery and derision and not much respect. Where ever I go on the social web, I have to ask myself what my purpose is. There are ways of manipulating lots of different platforms so that the clicker next to your user name goes up. One of the buzz words that gets tossed around on different platforms is engagement. It is usually a quantitative term having to do with the number of likes or followers your &quot;content&quot; has. Content is also a buzzword and one I don&#x27;t like very much. I&#x27;m not a content creator. I am a writer. I do the same thing millions of people have done before me. I think up things in my head. I assign words to those things and I record them. M…</span>

                              <span>The evidence suggests that empires often react to periods of their own decline by over-extending their coping mechanisms. Military actions, infrastructure problems, and social welfare demands may then combine or clash, accumulating costs and backlash effects that the declining empire cannot manage. Policies aimed to strengthen empire—and that once did—now undermine it. Contemporary social changes inside and outside the empire can reinforce, slow, or reverse the decline. More

There are so many tools that make it easy to build and deploy apps to your servers (with or without containers) and all of them showcase how easy it is to go from a cloud account to a fully deploy app.
While their claims are true, what they don’t talk about is how to maintain the stack, after “reclaiming” it. Version changes, breaking changes, dependency changes and missing dependencies, disaster recovery plans, backups and restores, major shifts in requirements all add up to a large portion of your time.
If you have that kind of team, budget or problem that deserves those, then more power to you.</span>

 Cellular phones are common targets for digital surveillance, along with all the software and applications they enable. These phones can be purchased anonymously — in person, in cash, with a covid mask and hat, and with a car parked far away — meaning only surveillance footage of the purchase is available once you walk out of the store. Yet, after purchasing these devices, we often bring them to houses, apartments, squats, camps, and hideouts. Cellular phones can be tracked using GPS or triangulation information from the cellular network provider, to determine your identity after purchase. Here we discuss a method to minimize the risk of unintentionall…</span>

                              <span>Image Gallery for Bear Blog
This gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It&#x27;s also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.
Actually, the gallery add-on itself isn&#x27;t very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here&#x27;s the result (instructions below):









Instructions
The gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a &quot;section&quot;) with the class gallery. Example:


* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Since the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:


* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Finally, add the following style to your theme:
/* Gallery */
.gallery ul  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
  padding: 20px 0;
  list-style: none;
}
.gallery li {
  position: relative;
  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


There have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.
I hope you find the gallery useful!</span>

                              <span>Wow. Thank you for posting this.  I am fifty years old.  In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school.  During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying.  Life happened.  He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin.  I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college.
Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew.  He did not have the best life, but he always smiled.  When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad.  When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked.
After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy…</span>

                              <span>Email accounts are the highest common denominator in online authentication. Phones are competitive, but people lose phones. Phone numbers are more common and durable, but the security of phone numbers is leagues below that of a flagship provider email account. It makes sense that so many authentication flows work this way.
When designing a &quot;fantasy football&quot; alternate authentication system for the Internet, start with account recovery: what happens when a user loses your fancy authenticator? If the answer is &quot;they just don&#x27;t get access anymore&quot; or &quot;a panel of their peers attests to them&quot;, your fantasy authentication system also needs a fantasy species of sentient beings to serve as users, because it won&#x27;t work for humans.</span>

In the first week I was walking her and passed a bus stop mainly used by school kids. There&#x27;s a small wall behind it and she dashed around and emerged with half a sausage roll hanging out of her mouth.
To this day, every time we pass that spot she enthusiastically pulls and goes round to inspect.</span>

                              <span>&gt; the longest post on my site, takes 92 KiB instead of 37 KiB. This amounts to an unnecessary 2.5x increase in load time
Sure, if you ignore latency. In reality it&#x27;s an unnecessary 0.001% increase in load time because that size increase isn&#x27;t enough to matter vs the round trip time. And the time you save transmitting 55 fewer KiB is probably less than the time lost to decompression. :p
While fun, I would expect this specific scenario to actually be worse for the user experience not better. Speed will be a complete wash and compatibility will be worse.</span>

                              <span>I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.
For those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.
So back to the update…
Key Updates
Changing the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.
You will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).
There is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.
A battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.
The long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.
The counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.
Updated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).
The response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!
…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.
Sample photos
Photos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.
If you&#x27;re interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they&#x27;re shipping these new cameras now.

                              <span>When I was first diagnosed with depression, I found myself going down the rabbit hole - Reddit posts from ten years ago, outdated mental health forums, and scattered blogposts written by other people with depression. In a sense, I felt like a pariah compared to my peers, and I was curious how depression manifests in others compared to me, because, despite living with this condition for years, I was clueless about what it was.
People tend to think that the most telltale sign of depression is sadness, but I discovered depression manifests overwhelmingly different across individuals: those who experience the crushing sadness, those with the intense mood swings, or those with detachment from their lives. There are depressed people who neglect hygiene for days, people who live in messy rooms ov…</span>

I decided to slow down on my blog posting this week following the end of Blaugust. I have been struggling with words lately but pushed through the momentum of posting daily during August. Now I’m spending some time collecting letters to be able to fully form words and sentences again. Great advice from Courtney in that post.
I have been eyeing the reMarkable for a couple of years now but can never justify buying it when I have a perfectly good iPad Pro for notes. I still want it. They just came out with reMarkable Paper Pro, which is a colored version. The costs is nearly the same as an iPad. Ugh. I hate being financially responsible and constantly asking myself: Do I really need this?

Title: ‘Towards an Archaeology of the Future’: Theodora Kroeber and Ursula K Le Guin

 On 20th August, 1911, an amazing thing happened: a man walked out of one world and entered another. He had walked further perhaps than any other man in history: several thousand years, by some people’s reckoning, from the Stone Age to the Age of Steam, from ‘Inside the World’ (as the Kesh would call it) to a place ‘Outside’ it,…</span>

                              <span>I sometimes wonder about whether the decline in IT worker quality is down to companies trying to force more and more roles onto each worker to reduce headcount.
Developers, Operations, and Security used to be dedicated roles.
Then we made DevOps and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 2/3 of the headcount, rather than integrating those teams.
Then we made DevSecOps, and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 1/3 the original roles, and that devs could just also be their operations and appsec team.
That&#x27;s not a knock on shift-left and integrated operations models; those are often good ideas. It&#x27;s just the logical outcome of those models when execs think they can get a bigger bonus by cutting costs by cutting headcounts.
Now you have new devs coming into insanely complex n-microservice environments, being asked to learn the existing codebase, being asked to learn their 5-tool CI/CD pipelines (and that ain&#x27;t being taught in school), being asked to learn to be DBAs, and also to keep up a steady code release cycle.
Is anyone really surprised they are using ChatGPT to keep up?
This is going to keep happening until IT companies stop cutting headcounts to make line go up (instead of good business strategy).</span>

Also, I&#x27;ve personally seen more interest in AI in devs that have little interest in technology, but a big interest in delivering. PMs love them though.</span>

In two decades of crawling through most of the declassified public nuclear material from the US nuclear weapons program, some exposure to classified material, and numerous hours of interviews with working and retired nuclear scientists he believes it&#x27;s the single most detailed schematic of an actual specific type of warhead he&#x27;s seen so far.

As he&#x27;s blogging about this it&#x27;s almost certain he has had real current working nuclear weapons experts from his contact list read the advances and not disagree.
Correct or not, it&#x27;s not a casual random thought from someone with no exposure to such diagrams.</span>

                              <span>This is one of the saddest posts I&#x27;ve read in a long time.
I love exercism. It&#x27;s beautiful, works in the browser and from CLI. The lessons are really well designed. It&#x27;s the perfect coding school environment.
So, I&#x27;m sad it isn&#x27;t viable.
But, I think I am really saddened by the comments here, second guessing all the decisions they made. If I were to second guess the people behind most of the comments, I would assume no one has ever run a business with payroll, or built something with this much reach. The comments ring really hollow for the most part and seem really callous given this person has sunk his life into making the world, and my life, a better place. I&#x27;m scared for the moment he is in life and sad there are not more positive comments, and even better, comments from people where they would actually help by making a donation.</span>

                              <span>Ironically, my answer is blogging.
I’ve abandoned four blogs this year, none lasting more than 60 days. My problem hasn’t been building the sites; it’s with my comfort level writing in public.
Things have improved recently. I’ve posted 11 days in a row. I’m determined to push past this awkward stage and find my voice.
The more you practice, the easier it gets.
I stopped trying to be perfect. I don&#x27;t have to write an essay. If it&#x27;s a short post, that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s no word count requirement. As long as I publish something, it&#x27;s a win!
Show up each day and give it your best shot. How else could you expect to improve?
If you&#x27;re a new blogger who can relate to this struggle, I hope this post encourages you. Don’t stress over clicking publish. Just share your honest thoughts. We want to hear your story.

                              <span>I use a lot of emojis when I write (especially chat), and it has always struck me as interesting that most people around me don’t. “Don’t they want to convey how they feel about this?” I ask myself. So much so that, for a long time, I thought my overuse of emojis came from a needy, co-dependent part of me that wanted to be pleasant to others and avoid any misunderstandings by being extra clear that I wasn’t angry or displeased with them through the use of the smiley face.
It wasn’t until quite recently that I realized my use of emojis was not “a weak front” (as is usually viewed by the professional and academic worlds), though it is neither a strength. What is it then? Well, it’s just an extra set of punctuation marks.
Emojis have drastically evolved since their first (genius) inception an…</span>

                              <span>My wife and I knew within a week of seeing each other that we would eventually get married. I had an adjustment to make though. In all my previous relationships, I&#x27;d been the biggest breadwinner in the family. This time that wouldn&#x27;t be the case. I was a public-school employee, and she was a partner in the most prestigious accounting firm in the area, earning about triple my salary. As life struggles go, making that mental adjustment wasn&#x27;t remarkably hard, but it did require me to reexamine myself, never a bad thing. I let go of the ego boost that earning a bigger wage gave me in the past and haven&#x27;t really thought about it much since then. We&#x27;ve never had an argument over money, even if she, with her accountant&#x27;s attention to detail, knows and often mentions the bank transactions I creat…</span>

 In 1926 the founding congress of a third national trade union association in France, the Confederation Generale du Travail Syndicaliste Revolutionnaire (CGTSR), presented its declaration of principles, the Charter of Lyon, as an updated version of the 1906 Charter of Amiens, the chief policy statement of the country’s largest pre-war labour organization, the syndicalist Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT).’[1] The Charter of Lyon came from the pen of Pierre Besnard (1886–1947), hailed by an admirer eight years later as a…</span>

                              <span>I just got back from getting my hair lopped at Mastercuts. $30. And let me tell you, this lady got it right, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a small fortune.
I stopped and got a cream cheese and lox bagel with a blood orange Pelligrino around the corner from the salon. I sat by the window, and people watched, hurrying to and from their office jobs high in the sky.
The bagel was alright, although I think I got spoiled living at Bathurst and Lawrence, a predominantly Jewish community, with their spectacular bagels, that now, every other bagel shop, pales in comparison. My people know how to make a mean cream cheese and lox.
I&#x27;ve been up to my neck in job search.
There&#x27;s one in particular I&#x27;m hoping will call back. Not because I like the job, but because it&#x27;s close to home, and i can do the job with my eyes closed.

I&#x27;m still spending most of my writing efforts on my email blog.
I wrote two letters: end of august diary, and deep affection. Hope you liked them &lt;3

This past week, I&#x27;ve been trying out Substack. I know, I know, a lot of you don&#x27;t like the platform for various reasons. I&#x27;m with you on quite a few of them.
But. BUT. What a pleasure it is to write in their editor. Things WORK! Can you even imagine?
There are no weird formatting issues. I can easily upload a picture and write a caption easy peasy. Bullet lists don&#x27;t go all wonky when i hit publish.
But on the flip side, it doesn&#x27;t feel like my writing home. The writers use the same writerly language, discussing Important Things in highly sophisticated, educated, long-form essays.
I feel like the outcast in the cafeteria sitting by myself eating a wet sandwich my mom made me.
