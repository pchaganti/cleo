                              <span>As the French economist Thomas Piketty most recently exposed, capitalism, across time and space, has always tended to produce ever-greater economic inequality. Oxfam, a global charity, reported that 2022’s 10 richest men together had six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth. More

                              <span>Since October 7, 2023, blatantly racist statements by Israeli leaders have been widely reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likened Palestinians to Amalekites, an ancient tribe in Old Testament lore whom Yahweh told the Israelites to destroy—men, women, children, infants, and cattle. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant referred to Israel’s assault on Gaza as a fight against “human animals.” Other Israeli officials called for erasing Gaza from the face of the earth, claiming that no Palestinian civilians are innocent.

                              <span>Yesterday, I read a post by Bearly Significant titled: &quot;Headlines Terrify Me&quot;. The post talked about the nuances of creating the perfect headline, that one time they made a typo, and their fear of sabotaging themselves with their words.
The post starts:
Crafting an effective headline is an art form mastered only by the finest journalists and editors. In fewer words than a tweet, all nuances and &quot;yes, buts&quot; must be simplified. This is crucial because journalists are taught to always consider: &quot;if someone only reads the headline, will they be somewhat informed?&quot;
Although the blog post was geared more towards the news sector, I can’t help but think that there is some parallelism with how bloggers craft their blog post titles.
I think everyone has their own flavor of titling their posts that works with their niche, and blogging voice. I follow a few who title their blog posts…
In a super vague way that makes you want to click on the post to understand what their title means
Short and straight to the point - you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into and the topic of the post
A poetic title that encompasses the topic of the post
A few words excerpt from their actual post
…and so on.
I think I do a mixture of some of the above. I tend to lean towards a blog title that evokes the same emotion as what I’m writing about. If it’s a more poetic piece, I title it as such. If it’s more casual, the title also tends to be. Although there are times when my posts tend to be vague, the goal is to rarely make the title vague. I always want you to know what you’re getting into so you can choose to read, or pass on my posts. I hate clickbait, and so I try to avoid that as much as I can.
My blog is pretty straight forward. What you see is typically what you get.

                              <span>Hello fellow blogger,
I found your blog and the &quot;Finding my Blogging Voice&quot; post through Bear&#x27;s &#x27;Most Recent&#x27; feed and felt like writing a reply.
It&#x27;s wonderful to see that you got your first post out there. A good and interesting one too, that many bloggers can relate to. Now that you&#x27;re up and running, the hardest part is over.
I&#x27;ve been in a similar situation myself and understand how you feel. My advice is to not overthink it and just keep writing and posting, writing and posting, writing and posting...
I always find myself thinking I could do better, write better, be better.
We can all do better, and the only way to achieve it is by consistently publishing content. Plus, what we consider our &quot;best writing&quot; today, will be replaced by &quot;even better&quot; soon. Looking back at what I thought was my &quot;best writing ever&quot; five years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t even publish it today.
Besides, we&#x27;re terrible at being our own critics. We&#x27;ll post texts we believe are outstanding, only to see them go by unnoticed. And we&#x27;ll post texts we hesitate to share, which end up being our most read ever.
Blogging is like a school without final exams, that’s what makes it so valuable and rewarding.
Just keep on blogging and never skip class.
Good luck!</span>

 Reports suggested that Blue Carbon—a company privately owned by Sheikh Ahmed al-Maktoum, a member of Dubai&#x27;s ruling family—had signed deals—a land grab enacted in the name of climate change mitigation. In response, Blue Carbon insisted the discussions were merely exploratory and would require (...)

                              <span>There are many ways I come up with blog post topics to publish. Most days, I sit down in front of my computer (or phone) and allow myself to just type, see what comes out, and then refine. Other times, I write intentional posts about topics that I have been ruminating on. Then there are moments when my emotions run so strong that I have to express them before I explode. I guess such was the case yesterday.
Of course, there are other ways. I have a list of topics I want to get to one day, but those have been mostly ignored. They overwhelm me too much.
Anyways, that&#x27;s not the intention of this post.
The best topics come to me in the most inopportune times, and so half the time, they never see the light of day. I often find myself coming up with things I want to write about in that space betw…</span>

                              <span>Has labor demand changed since the COVID-19 pandemic? In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.</span>

                              <span>We recently talked with Federico Bongiovanni (Google) and David
Eads (Red Hat), Chairs of SIG API Machinery, to know a bit more about
this Kubernetes Special Interest Group.
Introductions
Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about
yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
David: I started working on
OpenShift (the Red Hat
distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My
first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl
(kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth (RBAC and *Review APIs are ports
from OpenShift), apps (workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others,
but API Machinery is still my favorite :)
Federico: I was not as …</span>

                              <span>I want to blog but have never posted. I start a draft and work on it for hours and days, but I never think it&#x27;s good enough. I always think that I could do better, write better, be better. For so long all I&#x27;ve written is essays and official memos, I find it hard to let down my standards and be natural.
My recent resume is working against me; four years of college with essays and lab reports, and a year at a corporate job with professional communications. Writing off the cuff to a casual audience doesn&#x27;t come as easy to me as it once did. Somehow I need to undo the last five years of training and relearn simplicity and sincerity.
This is my first post and I don&#x27;t expect it to make a splash, but rather just a drop in the sea of writers online. My real goal with this post and others are to find my &quot;blogging voice&quot;, a version of myself who can write freely without worrying so much about the particulars.
I&#x27;m afraid this post will join the myriad others on BearBlog in the &quot;meta-blogging&quot; category; blogging about blogging. While that may be true for this first entry, I&#x27;m hoping to expand my writing in the coming months, I just hope someone will join me on that journey.</span>

                              <span>One of the houses I visited at work today had an absolutely stunning view of the sea. I could have easily stayed there all day.
When I mentioned how amazing the location was, the owner of the house replied, &quot;Yeah, but you don&#x27;t think about it after a while.&quot;
It should be illegal to live like that if you don&#x27;t even appreciate it, I thought as I walked back to my car. I started driving away and caught myself...
But what about me? I&#x27;m basically the same.
I don&#x27;t live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.
How often do I think about it? Hardly ever.
Yet, it&#x27;s something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.
Okay, it&#x27;s never going to be like &quot;the first high&quot; again, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Just a tenth of the first experience is still immensely precious and rewarding.
A tiny bit of awareness is all it takes to start observing and appreciating our surroundings. Let&#x27;s remind ourselves of the beauty of the mundane.</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been feeling upset and frustrated about some of the things happening in my life. I’m screaming into the unknown because I’m not really sure what else to do. The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.
Talking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.
I have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.
Every day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.
I just need to figure out how.

I was having a phone call with my best friend last night. I know he&#x27;s going through a really tough time and has been for a while. I felt anxious and stressed about whether or not I could be a good friend / what he needed. I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.
So why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I&#x27;ve always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me. It&#x27;s always been hard for me to get close to even my best friends. I really abused the shit out of &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t need your help&quot;.

This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been into running a blog or personal site very long, it&#x27;s safe to say you&#x27;ve heard the terms &quot;IndieWeb&quot; or &quot;small web&quot; thrown around. I&#x27;ve only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.
Really, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It&#x27;s like independent music. You&#x27;re writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.
It&#x27;s pretty punk, actually. Running your own corner of the internet is like recording an album in your bedroom and then selling it at the shows you independently worked with bars and venu…</span>

                              <span>Long after I&#x27;d finished creating the theme for this blog, I still thought the design was spot on (and still do). It&#x27;s the ideal theme in my opinion.
Recently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: &quot;It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It&#x27;s so incredibly boring!&quot;
I&#x27;d never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It&#x27;s true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.
Anyway, that, combined with Lou&#x27;s post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It&#x27;s always exciting and inspiring to try something different.
I plan to use Bear&#x27;s official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I&#x27;m also considering some larger changes as separate &#x27;add-ons&#x27;.
If I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it. I&#x27;m not a professional designer (and have a full-time job), so Bear with me — it might take a while...or never get finished.</span>

 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…</span>

Title: Origin of Anarchism

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…</span>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…</span>

These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.</span>

                              <span>In my first Blaugust post, I insinuated that I had a plan on how I’m going to tackle this month’s blogging challenge.
I&#x27;ll make a plan (of some sort) of how I&#x27;m going to tackle this at some point.
The truth is, my plan going into this is to not have a plan.
I joined the IndieWeb blogging community at the very tail end of March. In April, I joined a daily photo challenge hosted by Micro.blog. It was my very first challenge and had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed posting a photo a day alongside a community based on a specific prompt. I felt that sort of camraderie feeling amongst a blogging community I haven’t felt in a very long time.
That one was easy. I didn’t stress out about it because photos tend to come easier to me than words. I had a collection of photos I could dig into to meet t…</span>

                              <span>I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.
But there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can&#x27;t help but hire you. Can&#x27;t help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.
This is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.
What happened to being that intense &#x27;Steve Job&#x27; type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.
It goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don&#x27;t just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.</span>

                              <span>The summer term is over! I&#x27;m back in my hometown, bothering my dogs and following my grandmother around the house like a little kid. I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to settle for almost there. I&#x27;ll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.
School aside, there&#x27;s nothing much to write about today. The sky&#x27;s been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good. Thank God for bread.
I&#x27;m starting and abandoning so many new posts. I couldn&#x27;t settle on any of them, so I decided to do this one instead. Hope you had some good bread in your life today!</span>

Oh okay! I didn&#x27;t think about it that way! I&#x27;m so silly 🤪
For real though, one of the things about getting older is caring less about what people think. I used to think my dad looked so lame wearing 10 year old, $7 jeans from Walmart, generic black tennis shoes and a plain solid color tee shirt all the time like he&#x27;s some kinda Seinfeld character. Meanwhile I was straightening my blonde emo-ver hair, wearing skin tight skinny jeans with a pink studded belt from Spencer&#x27;s and walking around in loud, multicolor, just... massive tongued skating shoes.
These days, half the time I&#x27;m at work anyway so I&#x27;m wearing a long-sleev…</span>

                              <span>Today, I realized that the past three days share something important and beautiful: community.
Today, the pride parade took place here in Stockholm. I met up with my mom, sister, her husband, and their kids, who had come to the city for the occasion. It was wonderful sharing the event with them.
Yesterday, I decided to return to Mastodon. I missed the community and created a new account (birming@social.lol). Thank you all for the warm welcome. You&#x27;re amazing!
The day before yesterday, I decided to continue this blog. Since then, I&#x27;ve received wonderful feedback from you readers. It&#x27;s made me happy, grateful, and motivated. Thank you all!
Three days, three different experiences, but one common thread: community. It&#x27;s easy to overlook this invaluable aspect of life. However, when it&#x27;s absent, we truly understand its significance.
So, dear friends, thank you for being part of my life.</span>
