                              <span>If you work in C++, and you would like 2+ programs to share data structures (and/or native I/O handles a.k.a. FDs) among each other, there is a good chance Flow-IPC
- will make it considerably less annoying to code than typical approaches; and
- may massively reduce the latency involved.
Those sharing Cap&#x27;n Proto-encoded data may have particular interest. Cap&#x27;n Proto (https://capnproto.org) is fantastic at its core task - in-place serialization with zero-copy - and we wanted to make the IPC (inter-process communication) involving capnp-serialized messages be zero-copy, end-to-end.
That said, we paid equal attention to other varieties of payload; it&#x27;s not limited to capnp-encoded messages. For example there is painless (https://www.linode.com/blog/open-source/flow-ipc-introductio...
Of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with going straight to the GitHub link and getting into the README and docs.
Currently Flow-IPC is for Linux. (macOS/ARM64 and Windows support could follow soon, depending on demand/contributions.)

                              <span>This is a Postgres extension that can determine if a query should have an index. For example, for this table:
    create table book(
      id int primary key,
      title text not null
    );

    select *
    from index_advisor(&#x27;select book.id from book where title &#x3D; $1&#x27;);

    {&quot;CREATE INDEX ON public.book USING btree (title)&quot;}

It leans heavily on HypoPG[1], an excellent extension to determine if PostgreSQL will use a given index without spending resources to create them.

                              <span>A still from director Alex Garland’s film “Civil War.” (Courtesy A24)
My derriere still hurts from sitting on the edge of my seat at an IMAX theater while gawking at London-born director Alex Garland’s Civil War, which draws its inspiration from the USA’s contemporary red-state-versus-blue-state zeitgeist. Civil War marks the second time in US history – since Major-General Robert Ross’ British soldiers invaded the White House on August 24, 1814 – that the Executive Mansion has been attacked by Brits. But although this chilling movie’s director is indeed an Englishman, the armed invaders in the provocative Civil War are actually Americans engaged in this insurrectionary, incendiary fable that has the ring of truth.
In Civil War Garland brings the war home with his stark, startling dramatization of the type of fierce combat Americans are used to watching from afar on screens – and from their perches in imperialist cockpits and tank turrets – but are being fought right here in the homeland. As armed rebels march on Washington, D.C. – not on some hapless Third World country du jour – we witness shocking scenes of the Lincoln Memorial and White House, as well as the heartland, under attack in Civil War. (However, a closeup of machine gun nests in the Statue of Liberty’s torch, which is depicted in posters, does not seem to actually appear per se onscreen.)

                              <span>This is driving me oddly nuts:
&gt; &quot;I think there&#x27;s an understanding that &#x27;My twin isn&#x27;t quite as capable of communicating in the way that they need to, so I&#x27;ll help them with that,&#x27;&quot; she says.
&gt; That description fits Sam and John.
&gt; When asked to name his favorite episode of Sesame Street, John blurts out a series of words: &quot;Abby makes the seasons change.&quot; Sam understands immediately and quickly steps in to explain.
&gt; &quot;There&#x27;s an episode with Abby Cadabby, Rosita and Zoe, where they dance around with the seasons changing,&quot; Sam says. &quot;I think that&#x27;s the one he&#x27;s referring to.&quot;
I know that episode. It&#x27;s actually called &quot;Abby Makes Seasons Change&quot;, [1] so that &quot;series of words&quot; is the direct answer to the question. The point is probably true in general, but the example sucks.

                              <span>I recommend people use many different indicators to get a mental model of inflation, and you will notice that CPI does not represent inflation well.
The memes of Arby’s 5 for $5 becoming 4 for $10 are more informative than the CPI numbers.  Don’t let the shock at the grocery store wear off – it’s real and painful despite what the news tells you.
True inflation would measure the amount of prosperity achieved per hour worked.
Take 1963 as an Example. Sears sold entire two story home kits with all materials for $1600. An Italian rifle in 1963 was $20. McDonalds burgers were 15¢ . Postage was 5¢ and had only increased 5 times in the previous 100 years.
You might retort that average household income is $70000 now vs $6200 in the early 60s– a tremendous boon. Remember in 1963 only the man was working, and typically supported 4 kids, a wife and often parents in the home.
In other words you had 1 man working 50 hours a week afford a house and support 5-6 other people.  Today you have 2 people working 100 hours a week to support 1-2 additional people , while living in an apartment and living in a run down and crime infested neighborhood.
In case you think this is academic, look at the occupations for those who lived in today’s wealthiest neighborhoods.  Today Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and other super zips are exclusively $500k incomes and up.  In the 1960 census records you will find these good neighborhoods occupied with plumbers, painters and other blue collar workers.
My point is that inflation isn’t abstract and it isn’t a law of nature. It’s a deliberate approach to stealing your prosperity while you cheer it on.
Summers is right more than he’s wrong.  Real inflation has always been higher than the bogus CPI numbers, and the past 5 years it’s been accelerating.</span>

                              <span>Something I&#x27;ve never quite understood is why, in the UK, we cap the number of medical students per year. I&#x27;ve known very bright people who aspired to be doctors but had their applications turned down only to go on to do phds and become scientists instead. I&#x27;d rather have twice as many doctors who work sensible hours rather than the status quo burn out.

                              <span>The team I work on processes 5B+ tokens a month (and growing) and I&#x27;m the EM overseeing that.
Here are my take aways
1. There are way too many premature abstractions. Langchain, as one of may examples, might be useful in the future but at the end of the day prompts are just a API call and it&#x27;s easier to write standard code that treats LLM calls as a flaky API call rather than as a special thing.
2. Hallucinations are definitely a big problem. Summarizing is pretty rock solid in my testing, but reasoning is really hard. Action models, where you ask the llm to take in a user input and try to get the llm to decide what to do next, is just really hard, specifically it&#x27;s hard to get the llm to understand the context and get it to say when it&#x27;s not sure.
That said, it&#x27;s still a gamechanger that I can do it at all.
3. I am a bit more hyped than the author that this is a game changer, but like them, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be the end of the world. There are some jobs that are going to be heavily impacted and I think we are going to have a rough few years of bots astroturfing platforms. But all in all I think it&#x27;s more of a force multiplier rather than a breakthrough like the internet.
IMHO it&#x27;s similar to what happened to DevOps in the 2000s, you just don&#x27;t need a big special team to help you deploy anymore, you hire a few specialists and mostly buy off the shelf solutions. Similarly, certain ML tasks are now easy to implement even for dumb dumb web devs like me.</span>

They do have some legitimate reason to want to block specific versions of those apps if they cause stability issues on a new build of Windows, but at least in the case of StartAllBack the developer noted it isn&#x27;t targeted at a specific version this time, it&#x27;s a wildcard block.

                              <span>&gt;I have sympathy for news publishers
i have very little sympathy for news publishers.  I have sympathy for the journalists actually doing journalism, but news publishers have spent the last couple decades making their websites absolutely unusable, so that unless somebody links to an article externally there&#x27;s almost no point in going to their site directly.  And even after you&#x27;ve followed that link it&#x27;s almost impossible to read an article around the ads, login prompts, and chumboxes.   News websites are terrible, and it&#x27;s their own fault.  Giving them more money to do the thing they&#x27;ve spent so long failing at isn&#x27;t going to solve this problem.
&gt;directly tax the platforms and then redistribute the revenue to a fund created by government for news journalism themselves
yes.  and specifically, make sure the fund is actually funding journalism.  a link tax that gets paid out to news sites only incentivizes them to do the bare minimum amount of journalism to still qualify as a news site, and then fill up the rest of the site with SEO clickbait to maximize their clicks for the link tax.</span>

                              <span>I have sympathy for news publishers but I worry a lot about the principle of asserting that linking to something is an act that the link target has proprietary rights to over. At some level, it is almost a free speech issue. If I can&#x27;t refer to what you are saying, without owing you something, you have power over not just my speech, but a power to limit how your work is subjected to criticism and debate. It&#x27;s effectively an extension of copyright law to expand copyright holder&#x27;s rights.
Obviously all this is hyperbolic based the actual text of the law. The law doesn&#x27;t directly apply any sort of link tax, and it is shamelessly targeted only at Google and Facebook (to the point that they wrote Facebook in there by name, which is kind of stupid if you ask me). But if you drill into the reasoning it hits at the foundational level on this basic logic, and it&#x27;s pretty concerning if we assume then that this will be significantly extrapolated and expanded - as has been the history with all other aspects of copyright in the past.
Honestly I would rather that governments come clean and just admit that the problem they are trying to solve is actually a &quot;social good&quot; outcome, and therefore directly tax the platforms and then redistribute the revenue to a fund created by government for news journalism themselves. Trying to artificially construct that through introduction of significant new precedents in copyright law engenders huge risks of unintended consequences and potential future extrapolation and abuse of this principle.</span>

                              <span>I agree with Google on this one. Charging a fee just for linking to something is a bad idea.
It does get fuzzier if you&#x27;re also summarizing, and there&#x27;s clearly some sort of spectrum from &quot;just the URL&quot; to &quot;AI synopsis of the entire article&quot;. But at the level we see on Google News (headline + maybe a picture), I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s any good justification for charging.</span>

                              <span>tinygrad supports uneven splits. There&#x27;s no fundamental reason for 4 or 8, and work should almost fully parallelize on any number of GPUs with good software.
We chose 6 because we have 128 PCIe lanes, aka 8 16x ports. We use 1 for NVMe and 1 for networking, leaving 6 for GPUs to connect them in full fabric. If we used 4 GPUs, we&#x27;d be wasting PCIe, and if we used 8 there would be no room for external connectivity aside from a few USB3 ports.</span>

Kagi founder here and I want to clarify the train of thoughts around Kagi printing and giving away 20,000 t-shirts for its users.
- Kagi is not a typical VC funded startup.
- It is company I bootstrapped by going all in (meaning I put millions of dollars of my money into it).
- After all these years building it, we are lucky to have such incredibly passionate user community.
- That community is 100% responsible for Kagi&#x27;s growth as a business through word of m…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a subscriber simply because their search is far better than any available alternative. That&#x27;s the primary thing I want from them and so far they&#x27;re delivering it at a cost I consider fair.
Their other projects are not interesting or useful to me, but so far I can simply ignore them. Yes, on some level I wish they&#x27;d focus and quit wasting money and energy on things I don&#x27;t care about, but that&#x27;s really not my affair.
The one growing reservation I have is with regard to Vlad&#x27;s/Kagi&#x27;s actual, boots-on-the-ground approach to privacy. Kagi necessarily has the ability to know more about me than almost any other company. I want to see them demonstrate strong and unwavering commitment to respecting and protecting my privacy - through policy, technology, and careful and continuous vetting of partners. Expressed disinterest in collecting or capitalizing on my data is not enough, and seeing Vlad&#x27;s communications in which he casually shrugs or responsibility-shifts to a third-party heightens my concern.
For now, I remain a customer - but a wary one. I&#x27;ve stopped actively recommending Kagi personally and professionally because as a privacy advocate, it increasingly feels irresponsible to do so.</span>

                              <span>Lori seems (from the blog post and the subsequent email chain with the CEO) to be unnecessarily combative and most definitely too emotionally invested in Kagi.
You&#x27;re paying, what, 10, 25 USD - are you getting a good service for it? If not, unsubscribe, if yes, what&#x27;s the problem? Sounds like they&#x27;re profitable now, so little risk of the service dissapearing.
Unnecessary drama by people who live for drama. My only advice for Vlad would be to not get caught up in it.</span>

                              <span>I still pay for Kagi for its search but this has kind of been the problem from the beginning with their org.
- Search has been a breath of fresh air, I wish they dedicated more time to it.
- Orion...is ok? I use it off and on and it is fine but would rather have better search. The premise of the browser is nice but it feels like this could probably be a whole separate company or a purely open source endeavor. It has always been kind of clunky and not something I want to pay for.
- AI tools, I get the multiple pivots and I do believe that more recent advancements in ML/AI will make search a better experience but I do wish they had a little more focus.
- The t-shirts are weird and made me lose a lot of faith in their org. The way I look at it is instead of making their products better, they flushed a bunch of money down the drain for t-shirts and its offensive to paying customers who are paying because they enjoy the product and want it to become better, they don&#x27;t want a t-shirt.
- I don&#x27;t care about email, I don&#x27;t care about other tools, make a great search experience first. Release all of the AI enhancements that you think will make sense, focus, focus, focus.

After 2008, economists have been drifting back to old-school Keynesianism, with its emphasis on fiscal policy and interest rates. For the umpteenth time, it makes no sense to talk about interest rates causing changes in other macro […]

                              <span>Governments increasingly use export controls to limit the spread of domestic cutting-edge technologies to other countries. The sectors that are currently involved in this geopolitical race include semiconductors, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Despite their growing adoption, little is known about the effect of export controls on supply chains and the productive sector at large. Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.</span>

                              <span>Biden’s plans pretend the U.S. empire is not in decline. In 2024, he offers more of the old establishment politics. Trump basically pretends the same about the U.S. empire but carefully selects problem areas (e.g., immigration, Chinese competition, and Ukraine) that he can represent as failures of Democratic leadership. Nothing fundamental is amiss with the U.S. empire and its prospects in his eyes. All that is necessary is to reject Biden and his politics as incapable of reviving it. Trump’s plans thus call for a much more extreme economic nationalism run by a leaner, meaner government. More

                              <span>Bob Gibson was one of the three or four greatest pitchers in the history of baseball. He won the Cy Young Award as best pitcher twice. He was twice named MVP of the World Series, once in 1964 and again in 1967.  He was the rare pitcher to win the MVP for the National League. Gibson set the modern record for the lowest earned run average in a year. He was deemed so unhittable in the 1968 season that the league’s owners ordered radical changes to the game, including shrinking the strike zone and lowering the height of the pitcher’s mound. He was named to the All-Star game nine times and voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot. But still, Bob Gibson would have preferred to play basketball. The reason might be found in Gibson’s experiences in Columbus, Georgia. More

Does NATO’s presence, however small - sources say only one NATO officer will be based in Geneva – represent a historic change for a country that has been legally neutral since 1815? Although the office is presented as a multilateral liaison with international organizations – NATO has similar offices in Vienna and New York – it does raise questions about Swiss neutrality and neutrality in general.

                              <span>Known as treacherous and despite all the efforts of the neoliberal press to pretty him up, Michel Temer was extraordinarily unpopular. Understanding that public security was one of the most worrying issues afflicting the population, he decided to turn it to his advantage and puff up his reputation. He chose Rio de Janeiro, the country’s security flashpoint, suspending state autonomy and putting the army in charge, unfazed by the fact that he was messing with a narco-regime whose territories and institutions are shared out and controlled by criminal organisations. Temer’s exercise backfired. More

                              <span>In almost 30 years of software engineering, I came to the conclusion years ago that most deadlines were entirely arbitrary. The business isn&#x27;t going to fail if you slip a week, or frequently even six months and if it does its probably not the fault of engineering unless its so dysfunctional as to repeatably blow through its own delivery estimates. Sure there are regulatory deadlines, customer POC or delivery deadlines. But, truly hard deadlines won&#x27;t pop up as &quot;we need this done next week&quot; unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the business/sales side. A good functioning engineering/business unit will know far in advance of those kinds of deadlines and it becomes a question of whether the existing engineering org is capable of delivering the functionality within a heavily padded schedule.
Put another way, I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever seen a customer walk from a product because it wasn&#x27;t released on a cadence, in fact many aren&#x27;t actually happy about upgrades unless they are fixing a problem they have requested. And sales/POC cycles are such that frequently the customer may not actually have an alternative solution, or if they do, the chances they will switch to your product simply because you have X this year instead of next year isn&#x27;t something that hinges on small factors that can be done by the engineering team in short cycles. You win because the product is better/etc and that doesn&#x27;t happen overnight.
So, stressing and working endless 80 hour weeks likely is going to have the opposite effect and creates a low quality product that people are trying to get rid of because it keeps breaking.</span>

                              <span>&gt; One way to enhance the usability of unique identifiers is by making them easily copyable.
No matter what your identifiers look like, if you want them to be easily copyable you should add &#x60;user-select: all&#x60; to the element containing them.
If you do this, all of the text will be selected automatically when you click on the element.

                              <span>This reminds me of how GPT-2/3/J came across https://reddit.com/r/counting, wherein redditors repeatedly post incremental numbers to count to infinity. It considered their usernames, like SolidGoldMagikarp, such common strings on the Internet that, during tokenization, it treated them as top-level tokens of their own.
https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/8viQEp8KBg2QSW4Yc/solid...
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LAxAmooK4uDfWmbep/anomalous-...
Vocabulary isn&#x27;t infinite, and GPT-3 reportedly had only 50,257 distinct tokens in its vocabulary. It does make me wonder - it&#x27;s certainly not a linear relationship, but given the number of inferences run every day on GPT-3 while it was the flagship model, the incremental electricity cost of these Redditors&#x27; niche hobby, vs. having allocated those slots in the vocabulary to actually common substrings in real-world text and thus reducing average input token count, might have been measurable.
It would be hilarious if the subtitle on OP&#x27;s site, &quot;IECC ChurnWare 0.3,&quot; became a token in GPT-5 :)</span>

                              <span>The first patent was issued in the 1400&#x27;s — it is exactly how humans have progressed technologically and sociality. Let&#x27;s stop being so absolutist about these topics.
The problem here isn&#x27;t that patents exist, intellectual property protection is critical to investment and research. The issue here is two fold:
1. Patents usually involve a lot of research — and existed as a way to ensure that competition couldn&#x27;t imitate your product without also making that investment, licensing it from you, etc. If there was no protection, they would immediately undercut you since they don&#x27;t have investment costs to cover. Tech patents, however, are so broad and require so little actual material science that the &quot;protect the investment&quot; part doesn&#x27;t add up.
2. Patent offices couldn&#x27;t keep up with the rapid rate of technical advancement and may have granted overly-broad patents for what we would now consider rather general topics. The only effective way to invalidate these patents is expensive and lengthy court proceedings — which is fair, if you think about it, you wouldn&#x27;t want your rights taken away without a defence. But when weaponised, it can count-intuitively stifle the innovation it was trying to protect.
What we need is a better criteria and definition of IP which better suits modern industry.</span>

It&#x27;s a wasteful aberration that strangles innovation with red tape and hands control of our culture over to those with the financial mean to claim to own it.
The day we wrest back that control will be a good day.</span>

Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Bahrain, Qatar, they all remind me of that quote from King of the Hill—they are monuments to man&#x27;s arrogance. Desert cities hitting 50+ °C air temperature at midday which means air conditioning everywhere; vapid luxury in the form of expensive garish cars, shopping malls, and weird buildings and monuments, all while local chiefs who oppose stupid and unrealistic white elephant vanity projects are executed in the back alley.
This is one reason why I would like more nuclear power: it&#x27;ll take some of the money away from the Gulf.</span>

Now, it is debatable whether the ecosystem is ready to be doing this at (some) scale by default. I agree it&#x27;s not, dealing with e2e encrypted email is a less convenient experience than plaintext for most users. But not all - case on point, with Proton it&#x27;s fine.
It&#x27;s a valid question how opt in our out should work, with lots of implications and stakeholders involved. For better or worse, the status quo is that there is no signaling mechanism in openpgp (or keys.openpgp.org) at the moment to specify how a key should be used, so publishing a key is just a yes or no situation.
If op wants to offer encrypted email as a possible means of communication, but explicitly on an opt in basis, I would recommend a separate email address (or a tag, e.g. +encrypt) for that purpose.</span>

                              <span>Black holes are inescapable traps for most of what falls into them — but there can be exceptions. The theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind speaks with co-host Janna Levin about the black hole information paradox and how it has propelled modern physics.

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
Madhav Jivrajani (MJ): Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG
Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also
contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work

                              <span>I live in a city that was a hot zone for this type of contamination in the drinking water due to industrial waste from leather processing buried in the 60’s (shoe scraps treated with scotchgard.) We now have GAC filtering at the municipal supply level that is quite effective and not that expensive.  The large beds of carbon last quite a while if I recall correctly. Despite regular testing, everyone I know RO filters their water regardless.  For me, it’s because I have no idea what new previously “unknown” contamination will be next discovered, and would rather get out as much as is reasonable.
When the information began to surface I found it interesting the letters on public record going back to the 60’s with people warning that allowing this kind of dumping was a bad idea.  Of course being the primary employer to the entire city, the economics won at the time. Since, the cost of cleanup and lawsuits to that company have been massive.</span>

                              <span>My partner had a concussion many years ago, it was an eye-opening experience.
After months of mostly-useless conversations with doctors, neurologists, etc, we visited a sports medicine specialist who worked with snowboarders, skiers, etc, people who get concussions frequently.
The way the specialist described common concussion symptoms was really interesting: Effectively, your brain finds balance by using a combination of sight, touch (feet), and your inner ear. A concussion can impact the inner ear part of that equation, so your brain is overly reliant on sight and touch to compensate. This can cause all kinds of common concussion symptoms: Dizziness, sensitivity to screen time, etc.
Anyways, after giving us the rundown my partner was prompted to do a few simple exercises to test concussion symptoms. One of them was to stand on one leg and track a moving pen with her eyes. She&#x27;d done OK on some of the previous exercises but this one took her out, she lasted maybe 5 seconds and was completely exhausted and dizzy for the rest of the day because of it.
We ended up with a physical-therapy-like balance exercise plan that she stuck to regularly for a few months, and it ended up getting her to complete recovery.</span>

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>

Kubernetes. Technologies such as Kamaji and Cluster API are highlighted, along with their
integration with KubeVirt.
Previous discussions have covered
preparing Kubernetes on bare metal
and
how to turn Kubernetes into virtual machines management system.
This article concludes the series by explaining how, using all of the above, you can build a
full-fledged managed Kubernetes and run virtual Kubernetes clusters with just a click.
First up, let&#x27;s dive into the Cluster API.

Cluster API is an extension for Kubernetes that allows the management of Kubernetes clusters as
custom resources within another Kubernetes cluster.

In the previous article, we

In this article, we&#x27;ll show you a few various virtualization technologies in Kubernetes and prepare

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let&#x27;s explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can&#x27;t you just use docker
containers for building cloud?
The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.
Although the situation improves year by year, we often encounter vulnerabilities that allow

start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.
Why complicate things? - after all, …</span>

                              <span>As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers&#x27; exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.</span>

                              <span>Since Windows support graduated to stable
with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.
Some notable examples brought to the attention of SIG Windows were:

                              <span>Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.</span>

It has not, however, been destroyed by the workers of the world – it has been killed by capital itself. The idea, in a nutshell, is the following. As a response […]</span>

                              <span>While the slump in China’s property sector has been steep, Chinese policymakers have responded to the falloff in property activity with policies designed to spur activity in the manufacturing sector. The apparent hope is that a pivot toward production-intensive growth can help lift the Chinese economy out of its current doldrums, which include weak household demand, high levels of debt, and demographic and political headwinds to growth. In a series of posts, we consider the implications of two alternative Chinese policy scenarios for the risks to the U.S. outlook for real activity and inflation over the next two years. Here, we consider the impact of a scenario in which a credit-fueled boom in manufacturing activity produces higher-than-expected economic growth in China. A key finding is that such a boom would put meaningful upward pressure on U.S. inflation.</span>
