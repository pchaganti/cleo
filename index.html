I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody’s right to beautiful, radiant things.

 An anarchist is someone who rejects the domination of one person or class of people over another. Anarch-ism is a very broad umbrella term for a group of political philosophies that are based on the idea that we can live as anarchists. We anarchists want a …</span>

                              <span>This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the &quot;aliveness&quot; of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label &quot;life&quot; - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don&#x27;t add anything to the science.
Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell&#x27;s machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?
The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn&#x27;t the case. Lynn Margulis&#x27;s endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that&#x27;s how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.</span>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine
In the past this was easily available, with the most popular brand being Sudafed. My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.
Pseudoephedrine is very effective. It is also used to synthesize the somewhat related illegal drug methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;). Historically, meth manufacturers would hire people to buy large amounts of pseudoephedrine pil…</span>

According to the New York Times, internal polling showed that still undecided voters were &quot;six times as likely as other battleground-state voters to be motivated by their views of Israel’s war in Gaza.&quot; Either the Harris campaign missed this lurking demographic or, more likely, just didn&#x27;t care. Of course, Trump&#x27;s still going to give Netanyahu the greenlight to burn Gaza, the West Bank and southern Lebanon to the ground and then target Iran. More

In doing so, they adopted elements of neoliberalism that crushed the working class, intensified the class and racial divide, accelerated staggering levels of inequality, and intensified the long lacy of nativism,  all of which fed into the conditions for Trump’s appeal.

Recurring media messages that the economy was the deciding factor dismiss the resounding Republican fears about crime and immigration. Economy was also a main issue in the 2020 election, but according to Pew researchers, “Among Trump supporters, the economy (93%), immigration (82%) and violent crime (76%) are the leading issues.” More

This is a satirical paper.

QNX has been &quot;opened&quot; twice before. Each time, there was a rug pull, and it went closed again.
Before the first rug pull, open source groups routinely added QNX to their target list. There was a Firefox for QNX. Eclipse had QNX as a target. GCC and most of the Gnu command line tools could be built for QNX.
There was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.
All of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.
Then, in 2007, QNX went open source. You could even look at the microkernel. It wasn&#x27;t openly licensed, but you could look inside and build it.
In 2010, RIM acquired QNX, and, with no warning, closed the source. All open source development related to QNX…</span>

These migraines are absolutely debilitating. Some of them included a migraine aura1, while a few did not. During these times, if I’m lucky, all I need to do is ensure I am in a dark enough room, take my abortive migraine medication, follow my usual migraine self-care routine, and hope the pain passes quickly enough. If I’m not so lucky, then nausea also comes into the picture. I’ll spare you the details because that’s just messy.
When these attacks happen during the weekend, I’m typically ju…</span>

Yes, my glasses are taped because I&#x27;m still recovering from rhinoplasty and need to alleviate pressure off my nose.

For those who want to know:
20 sessions of laser + 4 sessions of electrolysis. Still slightly grey on upper and lower lip and continuing laser. I started Progesterone on month five instead of month six--and I shouldn&#x27;t have. I was simply hurting too much and trying to rush the process. Cyproterone as T-blocker and patches for Estrogen. I&#x27;m not giving the amounts here because that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important--it&#x27;s your blood level concentration for T and E that you should be looking at.
Thinking I would at least like to be one cup bigger in breast growth!
Everyone tells me to imagine where I&#x27;ll be in three years time and in all honesty, I don&#x27;t even know where I&#x27;ll be next year. I try not to think too far ahead now and just stay in the moment. :)
Ew-phoria moment: got checked out by a group of four men in a very uncomfortable way that made me run off. No thank you.
Weird moments: suddenly being asked out in the past two weeks and having crushes admitted to me by a few friends and I had to quickly and politely--but firmly--turn them down. Sorry, I&#x27;m very much taken.</span>

                              <span>I recently received an email from a reader of my blog asking about my process for building things.
I was wondering if you&#x27;d be willing to share your workflow for building products. At big companies, we&#x27;d usually do a lot of planning with diagrams, documentation, etc before building anything. I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when it comes to building a new products. Seeing how you&#x27;ve built some nice tools like Bear Blog, I wanted to hear from you personally.
I&#x27;ve built a lot of things over the past 10 years. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, with a few of them becoming actual products that fund the rest of my tinkering.
My approach to building products is more akin to a gardener than to a product developer. I play around with ideas, follow interesting threads, and see where the p…</span>

                              <span>Instead of the laser focus on TikTok as a threat, it would be better for the US and Canada to have real data protection laws that would apply equally to TikTok, Meta, Google, Apple, and X. What the EU has done is far from perfect but it bans the worst practices. The Chinese can buy all of the information they want on Americans and Canadians from ad brokers, who will happily sell them everything they need to track individuals&#x27; locations.
Perhaps the way to get anti-regulation politicians on board with this is for someone to do what was done to Robert Bork and legally disclose lots of personal info on members of Congress/Parliament, obtained from data brokers and de-anonymized.</span>

Response: Actually, here is the correct definition of &quot;inflation.&quot; As you can see from the correct definition, inflation rates are now good! Hopefully this helps you understand why things will never get better.
What the average voter hears: I can&#x27;t afford groceries. Your solution to this problem is to reframe the current situation as &quot;good.&quot; I still can&#x27;t afford groceries.</span>

-Inflation is not prices; it is the rate of change in prices.  Low inflation doesn&#x27;t imply low prices.
-Aggregate statistics don&#x27;t necessarily explain individual outcomes.
The Dems failed on this count massively, and have, for maybe the last 40 years, which is about the amount of time it took for my state to go from national bellwether (As goes Ohio, so goes the nation) to a reliably red state.  This cost one of the most pro-union Senators (Sherrod Brown) his job.</span>

                              <span>The economy I think was the huge sticking point. You can&#x27;t have everyone in your party saying &quot;the economy is good, it&#x27;s growing better than ever, look at all the jobs, etc.&quot; while literally no average person is seeing that. They are so out of touch that they think if finance/econ majors on tv say the economy is doing good than it&#x27;s doing good.
Compared to pre-pandemic
- Housing prices have shot up incredibly
- Loan interest rates are two or three times higher 
- Every day goods are higher
- Car prices are higher
- Insurance is higher 
- Utilities are higher
And that would be fine, prices go up over time after all, but all of that is on the back of pay, that for most people, has not gone up anywhere close to enough to cover all of that, if it&#x27;s gone up at all.</span>

                              <span>As someone living in WI who got barraged with ads from both sides, that wasn&#x27;t the messaging anyone saw AFAICT. The biggest issue on people&#x27;s minds was the economy. Dem messaging on economic policy was nonexistent. Women&#x27;s healthcare isn&#x27;t an issue that resonates with young (read: unmarried) men. It should, but it doesn&#x27;t. There could have been some &quot;look out for your wife&quot; messaging, but there wasn&#x27;t.
There&#x27;s a lot of people in the comments parroting whatever narrative they cooked up for 2016, but the reality is that both candidates&#x27; approaches were wildly different this time around.</span>

                              <span>From a game theoretical perspective this is a good result. It is a clear reiteration of the message to the Democrats: you won&#x27;t win by claiming to be 0.1% less bad.
The Democrats should have fielded a strong personality in their own right. This is not about left or right. It&#x27;s about mobilizing people by giving them something to care about. &quot;More of the same&quot; and &quot;not like that guy&quot; isn&#x27;t very enticing.
I don&#x27;t think the policy positions even matter that much, if you can make a strong case and gain the confidence of the electorate.</span>

It’s also interesting that you served in the U.S. military and didn’t recognize how self-serving and institutionally corrupt it is. I come from a country with an oversized military relative to its government, and the parallels I can draw between its behavior and that of the U.S. Army are uncanny.</span>

I&#x27;ve been to college and the only thing it &quot;educated&quot; me in is Computer Science, which I majored in. I&#x27;m not in any way better as a human being than my friends working in construction. Quite the contrary, their job is far more important to society than mine. If I stopped my niche research tomorrow, no one would really care. If handymen, farmers, or truckers stopped working, there would be riots.
Also, the DNC should really stop forcing unwanted candidates down people&#x27;s throats. It doesn&#x27;t work, even when you spam social platforms with your narrative.</span>

                              <span>I remember living in a different country as a child, hearing everyone talk about a faraway place called America.
Everyone wanted to go to America. The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.
Even as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.
America was the place to be. We would get freedom there.
That was a long time ago.
Now, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.
Today, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.
I am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).
I went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.
A lot will change over these next 4 years.
Be kind to your loved ones today.
Many of us need it.

                              <span>Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin
I tell myself that I blog for my own sake.
I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection.
I publish essays because it helps me tame my thinking.
And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.
I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats.
I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: expenses, books, movies, runs, etc.
Views and upvotes...
..just another metric to follow, a survey on whether anyone&#x27;s reading.
A measure of... something I&#x27;m not sure anymore.
Writing has been my outlet, a habit I’ve had an on-off relationship with over the years.
In all my reasons for writing, I mostly write for myself.
I agree with Mr. Godin -- writing is clarifying, motivating and fun, even if no one&#x27;s reading.
But I&#x27;ll admit, it feels good knowing someone else is out there nodding along, connecting to a piece I&#x27;ve shared.
Imagining that somewhere, a stranger reads my words in their own quiet corner, maybe in pajamas, maybe over coffee, and smiles, resonates, or even feels a spark of recognition.
To me, that’s inspiring.
So, even if nobody reads my blog, the act of sharing still matters.
My writing is still deeply personal, a habit of expression and reflection.
And if, by chance, someone wanders in this corner of the web, that connection, however fleeting, is simply a bonus.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

Shop talk and banter are fairly universal. Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn&#x27;t look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not.
The other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics. In academia and in highbrow society the tendency is to basically sanitise every social interaction. When you&#x27;re in an environment where that isn&#x27;t happening then you can&#x27;t suddenly ignore it any more.</span>

                              <span>Yet another Bear blog appreciation post.
I discovered Bear in 2023 through a Google search for minimal blogging platforms. Today, 379 days later, Bear has integrated into my routine.
I publish frequently without any pressure on the quality of my content. I write about whatever random things come to mind.
I programmatically sync my blog posts into my server to ensure I always have an archive. But I have no plans to leave Bear - as a user and observer of Herman&#x27;s product garden, I&#x27;m happy to support the platform.
I also tinker with my site around Bear without compromising the web performance. I have added routes like /pics, /status, and other handy features to mgx.me. I have removed the page hits (analytics) as well.
On rare occasions, people used to message me to say they connected with a particular post. However, I later removed contact details because now I prefer observing the community from the sidelines.
Beyond writing, I&#x27;ve become a daily reader of Bear blog discovery feed (Most recent &gt; Trending). I love finding interesting blog posts, especially offbeat entries and commentaries. It&#x27;s become a habit I look forward to.
After a year, Bear still feels like a great fit. Herman has created the perfect blogging experience that feels fluid with my digital habits.</span>

                              <span>I used to never share how I really felt, not even with my closest friends. Blogging about it would have been completely unthinkable.
On the outside, everything looked peaceful and happy. No problems here! But deep down, I felt terrible.
When I finally realized the seriousness of it and sought help, a whole new world opened up for me. I realized that I was far from alone in feeling this way. Suddenly, it no longer felt wrong or shameful, but human and understandable.
Nowadays, I&#x27;m open about both my past and during periods when I&#x27;m feeling down. I feel like it helps me, and actually others too. It creates a comforting sense of belonging and a realization that we humans are quite similar after all.
We&#x27;re only human...
It&#x27;s liberating to talk or write about it, it&#x27;s valuable for our fellow human beings, and we can get strengthening and motivating support. A wonderful example of this is the lovely comments I received in the guestbook and on Mastodon after yesterday&#x27;s post, Daunting Doubts. Thank you everyone!
I&#x27;m not saying everything is appropriate to share. I&#x27;m also not saying that you should force yourself to be open. But sharing that human &quot;ugly and embarrassing&quot; stuff we try to hide, I think that&#x27;s very healthy and valuable.
So next time you feel lost, share your shit!</span>

                              <span>Few days ago, I sat together with guys and girls around my age for a lunch. A girl passed her phone to each of us so we all can follow each other&#x27;s social media account. Every time this kind of event happens, I have to tell people I don&#x27;t own one or I used to. Some people get curious. Some people just don&#x27;t care. In this case, it was the latter. Ultimately, I always end up wondering if I may have sabotaged potential friendships because I don&#x27;t own one. However, I have had enough relapse to know that I actually don&#x27;t care anymore.
How it all began wasn&#x27;t because I understood the negative effects of social media since day one. It was actually because one day, I doom scrolled so hard, my eyes got hella dry and my head got so dizzy and stressed, I impulsively deactivated my account. Oh, and I …</span>

This question is a cross between what it says and what I&#x27;d like a chance to do if I were 18 all over again. It would be cool to have nearly 60 years of accumulated knowledge crammed into an 18-year old head. Let&#x27;s go.
Yep, go to college
All the people out there making noise about how college isn&#x27;t for everyone and that becoming a plumber or joining the army are good solid alternatives, you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about, those people are anti-education conservatives who went to college themselves and who plan on sending their children. They are trying to cover for the inability or unwillingness to make education affordable to the masses like the social democracies in Europe do—the countries that…</span>

Well, now it looks a bit like this:
There&#x27;s something very weird to me about hiding the discoverability of albums behind a series of links without any...you know, albums on display.
The biggest thing to me, however, is the categories chosen &amp; what seems very noticeably omitted... Soundtracks are nowhere to be found. Game music is a huge part of Bandcamp&#x27;s presence, and game soundtracks have always felt like an embarrassing little side-effect of Bandcamp&#x27;s popularity. Nearly every editorial focuses on indie hits, the big hitters that&#x27;ve come to the platform, etc. etc... Yet somehow, Epic bought Bandcamp at one point in time before it w…</span>

                              <span>A lot of you probably know that I have ADHD. I talk about it fairly often.
I didn&#x27;t get diagnosed until somewhat recently, because, as is the story for a lot of women with ADHD, my symptoms as a little girl were different than the ones that were typically recognized, AKA the ones that young boys tend to exhibit more often. I was incredibly messy: my desks, lockers, backpacks, and bedroom tended to be absolute chaos. I lost things like homework and winter gloves a lot. I was constantly spacing out and daydreaming. I was generally kind of weird and bad at conversations.
But I wasn&#x27;t disruptive or hyperactive, and I got good grades despite my problems with remembering to do homework, so my symptoms weren&#x27;t seen as symptoms. They were flaws. I didn&#x27;t need help, I just needed to try to be bette…</span>

setup
enable usb debugging on the device:
download adb command line tool:
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
cd platform-tools/

connect the device to computer via usb, a pop up should appear on the device asking to allow the computer to perform usb debugging, tap ok.

                              <span>&gt; Striking during election week is kind of a crappy move to pull
I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. The point of a strike is to demonstrate the value of your labor by withholding it. Withholding your labor in a slow week would be counterproductive. Strikes (just like any effective form of protest) are supposed to be inconvenient, so in saying what you said, you&#x27;re really just expressing you don&#x27;t like strikes. Having this blow up in election week is a risk the Times knowingly took in not meeting their workers&#x27; needs sufficiently, and drawing out the negotiations as long as they have. The guild is doing the right thing.</span>

                              <span>Personally - just let the developer own the machine they use for development.
If you really need consistency for the environment - Let them own the machine, and then give them a stable base VM image, and pay for decent virtualization tooling that they run... on their own machine.
I have seen several attempts to move dev environments to a remote host.  They invariably suck.
Yes - that means you need to pay for decent hardware for your devs, it&#x27;s usually cheaper than remote resources (for a lot of reasons).
Yes - that means you need to support running your stack locally.  This is a good constraint (and a place where containers are your friend for consistency).
Yes - that means you need data generation tooling to populate a local env.  This can be automated relatively well, and it&#x27;s something you need with a remote env anyways.
---
The only real downside is data control (ie - the company has less control over how a developer manages assets like source code).  I&#x27;m my experience, the vast majority of companies should worry less about this - your value as a company isn&#x27;t your source code in 99.5% of cases, it&#x27;s the team that executes that source code in production.
If you&#x27;re in the 0.5% of other cases... you know it and you should be in an air-gapped closed room anyways (and I&#x27;ve worked in those too...)</span>

                              <span>&gt;&gt; [Why not build programmer performance measurement tooling?] It&#x27;s the job of a manager to know what their reports are up to, and whether they&#x27;re doing a good job of it, and are generally effective. If they can&#x27;t do that, then they themselves are ineffective, and that is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.
Agreed wholeheartedly, but for slightly different reasons. To wit, laziness and Goodhart&#x27;s law. [0]
In the absence of infinite time, automation will excuse a lack of manager curiosity, as other competing tasks absorb the freed time.
Consequently, most managers with automated dashboards showing performance metrics won&#x27;t use those dashboards... plus all the person-to-person work they were previously doing. They&#x27;ll only use those dashboards.
Which then slowly but inexorably turns your employees into dashboard-optimization drones via operant conditioning.
Helping a colleague doesn&#x27;t show up on the dashboards? Fuck that. Digging into what looks like a security vulnerability isn&#x27;t on the sprint board? Fuck that.
Which is incredibly corrosive to quality, creative system design.
And then, because this is the work reality you&#x27;ve created, the creative folks you really want working there bail for greener pastures, and you&#x27;re left with bottom of the barrel talent and retention problems.

Historically, cancer was treated with therapies that are toxic to all cells, relying on the fact that cancer cells divide quickly and are unable to handle stress as well as normal cells (chemotherapy, radiation).
The last couple of decades we&#x27;ve seen many targeted cancer therapies. These drugs generally inhibit the activity of a specific protein that lets the cancer cells grow (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) or prevents the immune system from killing the cancer cells (e.g. PDL1 inhibitors).
This mechanism is way more interesting. The gene BCL6 is usually turned on in immune cells when they are mutating to recognize foreign invaders. This process involves lots of DNA damage and stress, but BCL6 stops the cells from dying and is therefore important for normal immune function. Unfortunately, this makes BCL6 a gene that is often co-opted in cancer cells to help them survive.
The method cleverly exploits the oncogenic function of BCL6 not by inhibiting it, but by turning it into a guide, enabling the delivery of activating machinery to the targets of BCL6 and reversing the inhibitory effects on cell death.
The whole field of targeted degraders, molecular glues, and heterobifunctional molecules is a growing area of interest in cancer research.</span>

                              <span>At a former company, we were all issued YubiKey Nanos, which just never worked for me. None of my coworkers had a problem, but I couldn’t get the damn thing to register a touch no matter what I did, including swapping keys.
 Eventually I came across a thread on an internal list for employees over forty, with several other people who were all having the same problem. The solution? Lick your finger. Gross, but it did the trick. And I’m stuck licking my finger every time I need to make a YubiKey work.</span>

                              <span>Touchscreens are anti-accessibility.
Lack of tactile feedback for the sight-impaired is the obvious part but there is another thing:
Touchscreens just stop registering your touch when you get old. The older you get the less moisture there&#x27;s in your skin, which at some point makes touch screens ignore you.

                              <span>for some reason, i&#x27;ve fantasized for years about being the kind of artist who always travels around with their iPad Pro by their side, ready to sketch and work on a moment&#x27;s notice. when i sit down and actually deconstruct this fantasy, it becomes abundantly clear that it&#x27;s completely unrealistic for me, and born out of incredibly shallow desires.
there&#x27;s nothing wrong with people who do that. they&#x27;re not shallow. it&#x27;s the digital equivalent to carrying a sketchbook with you, and it&#x27;s certainly more portable and intuitive to use than other digital art mediums.
but there&#x27;s this mental disconnect i keep experiencing. for a long time - even when i was well into college! - people regarded my preferred medium and my job as some kind of witchcraft. &quot;what, so the computer does all the work for yo…</span>

                              <span>i follow an artist on Tumblr who’s been doing a daily drawing since 2008.
they’re mostly self portraits.
his work is expressive, somewhat childlike, and genuine.
sometimes he shows pictures of all his notebooks lined up neatly on a wall shelf. years of daily moments recorded with pencils and other colorful media.

linus-malmqvist
a couple of things inspire me:
along with his daily drawings that he posts, he writes a few lines about his day. they’re short snippets of thoughts or daily happenings that leave the reader wanting more.
ex:
18 September 2024 
Onsdag

The logs arrive, I can now start building my house. 

the other thing that encourages me creatively is that he’s been doing this project since 2008. that’s a long time. It astounds me that more people aren’t liking his drawings.
the number of likes on his work doesn’t seem to faze him.
he just continues drawing, sharing his work, and not making things more complicated than they need to be.
he loves to draw, so he does it.</span>
