Silky has been working as an organizer on issues related to racial and migrant justice for over two decades. Originally from Texas, she began fighting the expansion of immigrant jails on the US-Mexico border in the aftermath of 9/11. In 2009, she joined the staff of Detention Watch Network, a national coalition building power to abolish immigrant detention in the United States, and now serves as its executive director. More

                              <span>Yesterday I was walking on the sidewalk with my soccer ball looking for a patch of grass to play on1 when I noticed someone walking towards me and gesturing at my ball. I hesitated, because tossing your ball to a stranger by a busy street isn&#x27;t the most prudent idea, but eventually the child in me won. The ball bounced once on the concrete before landing at his feet.
Thump thump thump. Chest, thigh, right foot, left foot, pass, repeat. We juggled the ball back and forth on the sidewalk for a minute before I mouthed I have to go and pointed with my thumb. After he returned my ball, we smiled at each other and went our separate ways.
Not a single word was exchanged during our keep-up session. And yet the memory&#x27;s been keeping me warm since. I love that the ball can turn strangers into friendly ones, that you can play with someone for hours without knowing the first thing about them and still have a blast. In that regard soccer stands alone among all my hobbies.
This should be the plot for the next Mission: Impossible movie.↩</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to share a new Bear Blog theme paying homage to the classic vampire film, Nosferatu. I was inspired to create this one after watching the trailer for the upcoming 2024 remake. The theme has an atmospheric aesthetic that evokes the haunting tone of the original movie. I&#x27;ve designed this theme to be ideal for blogs focused on horror, Gothic literature, or film reviews. The font treatment is also ideal for long-form book reviews or essays. I hope you enjoy exploring the CSS and customizing it to your liking. Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I think I hear rats scratching in the walls...

                              <span>Yesterday, I launched the July Reply blog challenge. I like the idea and hoped there would be a lot of interest, but so far, it&#x27;s been lukewarm.
For the past few weeks, I have posted something new every day. Many of the texts that I&#x27;ve been proud of have barely gotten any attention at all.
“Why am I even doing this for?”
I heard myself thinking that today. It&#x27;s so incredibly stupid and ridiculous that it&#x27;s embarrassing to even mention it.
I&#x27;m doing this because I love it. If others like it too, great, but that&#x27;s not the main purpose.
No one likes everything we do, whether we&#x27;re a small blogger or the biggest artist in the world. On the other hand, we will always think that our latest creations are our best. Why else would we continue?
We are all different—equally different.
You&#x27;re sitting on the world&#x27;s best joke, looking forward to the laughter, but you&#x27;re met with the reaction: “Is that all?”
Different.
You tell someone about the greatest movie ever made and then ask what they thought: “It wasn&#x27;t to my taste, so I turned it off after half an hour.&quot;
Different.
You like watching football. I hate sports.
Different.
What a wonderful diversity!</span>

                              <span>This essentially killed my (EU-based) startup in the project management and collaborate space. Before MSFT bundled Teams with O365 we were rapidly growing and closing enterprise customers in the automotive, energy and education industries with high retention rates. Right around the time the Teams bundling started our retention dropped, churn went through the roof, growth slowed down, we failed to raise our next round because of it and had to drastically downsize the company, causing even more churn (about 80% net churn in 2 years). This move by the EU is good, but too little too late - 99% of the companies that were hurt by this have already shut down, and the ones still running will take years to recover...</span>

I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again: https://httptoolkit.com/blog/public-cdn-risks/
You can reduce issues like this using subresource intergrity (SRI) but there are still tradeoffs (around privacy &amp; reliability - see article above) and there is a better solution: self-host your dependencies behind a CDN service you control (just bunny/cloudflare/akamai/whatever is fine and cheap).
In a tiny prototyping project, a public CDN is convenient to get started fast, sure, but if you&#x27;re deploying major websites I would really strong recommend not using public CDNs, never ever ever ever (the World Economic Forum website is affected here, for example! Absolutely ridiculous).</span>

                              <span>Game theory at work?  Someone needs to maintain legacy code for free that hosts thousands of sites and gets nothing but trouble (pride?) in return.  Meanwhile the forces of the world present riches and power in return to turn to the dark side (or maybe just letting your domain lapse and doing something else).
If security means every maintainer of every OSS package you use has to be scrupulous, tireless, and not screw up for life, not sure what to say when this kind of thing happens other than &quot;isn&#x27;t that the only possible outcome given the system and incentives on a long enough timeline?&quot;
Kind of like the &quot;why is my favorite company monetizing now and using dark patterns?&quot;  Well, on an infinite timeline did you think service would remain high quality, free, well supported, and run by tireless, unselfish, unambitious benevolent dictators for the rest of your life? Or was it a foregone question that was only a matter of &quot;when&quot; not &quot;if&quot;?</span>

                              <span>I highly recommend everyone try it out if you&#x27;re in SF. It&#x27;s an incredibly smooth and sure ride. The cars are really nice too (Jaguar I-Pace electric cars), clean and spacious.
The first time you ride in one, it feels truly sci-fi. But within 5 minutes, you&#x27;re almost bored of it - that&#x27;s how good it is. If I had to choose between an Uber of questionable cleanliness and driver temperament and a Waymo with a slightly longer wait and slightly more fare, I&#x27;d choose the Waymo every time.
(I have no affiliation with Waymo, Google or any related industry - it&#x27;s just an amazing service!)</span>

                              <span>A long long time ago as a poor college student, I signed up to get a “free PC.” You got a shitty packard bell tower for signing away your privacy and allowing a bunch of ads annd telemetry exist in the OS. It really wasn’t that intrusive and eventually the company folded and I got a free (shitty) ad-free pc out of it.
I’m a Mac user now but when I pull up windows 11 on my kid’s or wife’s laptop, it feels like that free-pc dot com again, only it’s in every person’s PC. I’m genuinely shocked at the amount of trash that barrages a common user in windows, and shocked that Microsoft gets away with it.
My 14 year old gets barraged with not just co-pilot but a bunch of news and trash clickbait that is straight inappropriate for kids to see.
I’ve had to remove it all twice but with every significant update, somehow my settings get reversed and we’re back at square one.
I tried even using local accounts but it causes significant issues in the OS.
If you’d told me in 1999 that free-pc.com was the dystopian digital future we’d all be living in, I’d have laughed you out of the room - but that’s exactly what we have. The only difference is that the PC isn’t free. We are.</span>

                              <span>JULIAN ASSANGE IS FREE
Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stanstead airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.
This is the result of a  global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom  campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum,  all the way to the United Nations. This created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal that has not yet been formally finalised. We will provide more information as soon as possible.
After more than five years in a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day, he will soon reunite with his wife Stella Assange, and their children, who have only known their father from behind bars.
WikiLeaks published groundbreaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions. As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles,and for the people&#x27;s right to know.
As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom.
Julian&#x27;s freedom is our freedom.

NTP is worth moving to a memory safe language but of course it&#x27;s not the single most critical thing in our entire stack to make memory safe. I don&#x27;t think anyone is claiming that. It&#x27;s simply the first component that got to production status, a good place to start.
NTP is a component worth moving to a memory safe language because it&#x27;s a widely used critical service on a network boundary. A quick Google for NTP vulnerabilities will show you that there are plenty of memory safety vulnerabilities lurking in C NTP implementations:
https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2153...
Some of these are severe, some aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s only a matter of time though until another severe one pops up.
I don&#x27;t think any critical service on a network boundary should be written in C/C++, we know too much at this point to think that&#x27;s a good idea. It will take a while to change that across the board though.
If I had to pick the most important thing in the context of Let&#x27;s Encrypt to move to a memory safe language it would be DNS. We have been investing heavily in Hickory DNS but it&#x27;s not ready for production at Let&#x27;s Encrypt yet (our usage of DNS is a bit more complex than the average use case).
https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns
Work is proceeding at a rapid pace and I expect Hickory DNS to be deployed at Let&#x27;s Encrypt in 2025.</span>

                              <span>This happened to me. I was wondering why my internet speeds were slow when I discovered that Microsoft was in the process of uploading my users directory, they had already uploaded almost two gigs when I realized. They also changed the path to these directories to something like C:\Users\name\OneDrive\Desktop\. Another poster in this thread claimed it&#x27;s easy to reverse -- I disagree, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to track down the setting, and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do this. When I did, it gave me an error for one of the directories and refuses to revert (documents?).
I don&#x27;t like leaving negative or hyperbolic comments on HN, but this was enraging and unacceptable to me. It&#x27;s hard to convey without coming off as unhinged. I only ever boot into Windows nowadays when I need to compile and test a Windows build of software. I understand Microsoft has built up good will through efforts like VS Code, but it&#x27;s all undone because of things like this. I avoid MS products, they cannot be trusted.</span>

                              <span>Many of these suggestions are good. (I should make my subheds clickable!) But a couple of them, oh dear…
I really hate progress bars, they are incredibly distracting. One of the worst examples of front end programmers wasting their time reimplementing browser functions badly. I already have scroll bars! I do not need more scroll bars!
Also, link decoration: my browser already has a nice discreet indicator to tell me where a link goes, I don’t need or want mysterious dingbats in the running text. (It reminds me of websites that are so scared of hyperlinks that they send them via interstitial warning pages “YOU ARE LEAVING THE SITE!!!!1!1!”, or in a recent case via a $yber$ecurity box that broke the link completely.) And preview popups? Get in the sea, hostile obnoxious interruption.</span>

As will this comment thread. We saw the same rhetoric on Holmes and Bankman-Fried. Once they were charged it was obvious they’d get off. Once convicted that they’d get a light sentence. Once sentenced that they’d have their sentences shortened, et cetera.
It’s a lazy learned helplessness that’s always potentially right because it feeds into a type of cynicism that has always been part of human nature in every culture since the beginning of history.</span>

                              <span>You can feel however you want about Apple&#x27;s rules and EU regulation, but I think it&#x27;s pretty indispuitable how wrong it is that Apple prevents developers from explaining these rules to their users. Apple prevents developers from saying that Apple takes a % cut of the sale. Apple prevents developers from saying its available cheaper elsewhere. If Apple feels these rules are so just and fair and indispuitably correct, why does it go to such measures to hide them from its consumers?
Consistently these anti-steering rules are what gets Apple in trouble all around the world. It&#x27;s the one part Apple lost in the US Epic case, and it&#x27;s the EUs first point on their breach. Apple has done this to themselves by being so stubborn and refusing to budge an inch on how they run their platforms. The tiniest concession years ago could have avoided all this regulation on them.</span>

Last night, I was unable to sleep (unfortunately, insomnia seems to be a common side effect in antidepressants). I stared up the ceiling aimlessly, and pondered, A month has passed. Even more. I am still the same. What changed?
I was clearly anxious and upset throughout the day, because I skipped work too. I told myself I deserved a break, but deep down I knew I was lying to myself. The break was an excuse.

Many bloggers maintain a blogroll where they suggest the writing of people they like to others. I&#x27;ve found some good stuff there. (Note - Quit putting Daring Fireball in your blogroll. Everyone in the universe who needs to know about that blog already reads it). A few months ago, I found Feedle, a search engine for blogs and podcasts that allows you to add your own blog to its database. It&#x27;s a good resource to find people who are well versed in the things you are interested in. Check it out.

                              <span>U.S. inflation surged in the early post-COVID period, driven by several economic shocks such as supply chain disruptions and labor supply constraints. Following its peak at 6.6 percent in September 2022, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down rapidly over the last two years, falling to 3.6 percent recently. What explains the rapid shifts in U.S. inflation dynamics? In a recent paper, we show that the interaction between supply chain pressures and labor market tightness amplified the inflation surge in 2021. In this post, we argue that these same forces that drove the nonlinear rise in inflation have worked in reverse since late 2022, accelerating the disinflationary process. The current episode contrasts with periods where the economy was hit by shocks to either imported inputs or to labor alone.</span>

                              <span>I struggle with this thing, of remembering certain people in such a golden light. Before this seems like a post talking about not-so-good people, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s about perfectly nice people.
The thing is, the way I tend to remember people is by how they made me feel. Few people in my life have made me feel like a real, raw person when talking to them. But some have. Some of these people are miles away, and have maybe always been miles away, both geographically and otherwise.
It&#x27;s a really painful thing, because as these memories I hold go further and further back in my memory, I don&#x27;t know what I want anymore. All I really want is to feel the way they made me feel again. Not so easy though, is it?
We&#x27;ve both grown in separate ways, and I&#x27;m grateful for where I am in my life, I think I&#x27;ve done pretty alright for myself so far. No matter what I do though, it does feel like there&#x27;s a certain hole in my life, somewhere I&#x27;m lacking greatly. The remedy is so far though. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t even exist, not anymore.</span>

                              <span>I’m not a fan of having dark mode on my site because I have a hard time choosing colors that speak to me. I like to keep things minimalistic with my colors, and for me, it’s just much easier to do with a white background. However, I know (and acknowledge) the importance of having one, and so I pushed myself to do some tinkering on the blog this morning. Besides, my eyeballs also hate me when I look at my site at night, and so I’m sure it’s the case for other people too.
I subscribe to a lot of blogs via RSS reader, but I do take the extra step to launch their site to read the post. I have a deep appreciation for those who take the time to design their site the way they want, and so I want to read their posts the way it was meant to be read. It’s kind of like: listening to an album in order because I know that the artist ordered it a specific way for people to listen to. At the same time, it’s OK if you want to shuffle the playlist if you as the consumer want to, just like it’s OK for those who read my posts to do so via an RSS feed.
Anyways, this is just a quick post to say that, if your preference is dark mode, it is now available on here. I’ll revisit my site again at night time to test out the color contrasts (since I worked on this during daytime) to see if it makes sense, or if my eyeballs are still straining to read things.
Due to this, I’ve also gone ahead and created a Changelog for my site, so I can keep track of the little (and big) changes I make on here.
Side note:
I typically do have my screens on dark mode, and so if the sites/blog I read have dark mode, I read those in dark mode. It’s a weird thing for me to want my site in a lighter background, but I do struggle with it sometimes. Thanks to those who have put up with probably burning your retinas reading my posts if you weren’t doing so in an RSS reader. I appreciate you.

 There is no such thing as human society. 
 A lot of muddled thinking rests on the error that because ‘society’ is a useful noun, it must refer to a thing. It is one of those nouns like ‘journey’ and ‘tennis’, which refers not to a thing but to a relationship between things. The statement ‘human society exists’ is simply a less cumbersome way of saying ‘human individuals relate to each other in certain complicated ways’. The question, ‘what is the purpose of human society?’ means the same as, ‘why do human individuals associate in the way they do?’.

                              <span>Hi - author here.
This is a big question tbh and the lack of a succession plan is a function of many things:
1. This was my dad&#x27;s baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one&#x27;s mortality which I also believe was difficult for him.
2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering/science of the company made us a non-starter.
3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession/exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly.
There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I&#x27;ve thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those &quot;play the cards you&#x27;re dealt&quot; kind of situations.
Thanks for reading.</span>

                              <span>It absolutely melts my mind every time I come across the two facts that:
- People experience their thoughts very differently
- We all secretly believe that deep down, everyone experiences thought like we do.
I&#x27;ve never really had a strong internal monologue when thinking, so my assumption would always be that of course, thinking isn&#x27;t very linguistic (even if we can use it as a tool while thinking).
It seems like there&#x27;s a large number of people who experience their thought exclusively as language.
That sounds absolutely nuts to me, but I&#x27;ve heard people say the exact same in reverse. Even more fringe is that there&#x27;s a sizable number of people who when thinking about words (i.e. remembering names) visualize their words as text. What!? I can&#x27;t imagine that anymore than I can imagine how a jellyfish feels?

                              <span>It was exciting, to say the least. I had an exam that day, and people usually finish their exams and go on their way. The problem was I had never talked to my crush before, so I couldn&#x27;t exactly call her up to meet me. I finished my exam really early—about an hour and a half early—so that I wouldn&#x27;t miss her.
Let&#x27;s cut back to the morning of that day. I had already prepared what I wanted to say to her. But since I might talk non-stop, I decided to go with a letter (yeah, I&#x27;m old school that way—don&#x27;t judge me). I woke up and did my morning routine (yes, I do have a routine). Then I wrote what I wanted to say, put it in an envelope, and went to the gym because I was too excited and nervous.
Now back to the scene where I&#x27;m waiting in the corridor for her to come out of the exam hall. Man, I …</span>

Intro
I have been “delving” into jax and einsum notation lately in my quest to become a shape-rotator.
This post is divided into two parts. In the first part, we go through einsum notation basics. The second part is about understanding simple transformer code in jax which uses a lot of einsum.
From your end, I want some brains (no I am not a zombie, I just want your attention). I also assume knowledge of numpy basics, matrix m…</span>

                              <span>Hello, new corner of the internet I&#x27;ve just found!
I found this place in the most fun way, I found a zine that was (I can only assume) planted in the library I work at by
veronique.ink! I thought it was the coolest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen, the coolest idea. Initially I didn&#x27;t realize it was a website link that was written on the page, but an instagram handle, so I was struggling to find them for only a second before I found the sense to type it into google.
I recently lost my notebook, or at least can&#x27;t find it in the mess of my room. Usually I write my random thoughts in there, as I figured I had become above the notes app and was looking for reasons to stay off my phone. Of course, as soon as I lose my means of documenting my ideas, all sorts of events pass me by with nowhere to write about them. I&#x27;ve only just finished high school, recently lost my grandmother, and all sorts of change is crashing my way, and now I need to just stew in it..? Or worse, take to my notes app??
Then lo and behold, there&#x27;s the zine just sitting on the shelf. Scrolling through these websites here, I figured maybe it was a sign. Or I&#x27;m just bored and want a new hobby. Only God knows. So anyway, I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll still find my notebook once I get around to cleaning my room. Maybe then I can even publish those thoughts in there! For now I&#x27;ll just write them straight from screen to the world.</span>

Every time I search on the start menu there is a web search, impossible to turn off. How is that acceptable?
I install Edge Beta to test something, and the I uninstall it. All of the sudden my search provider in my normal Edge is reset.
And the nagging everywhere. No I don&#x27;t want &#x27;back-up&#x27; my files (OneDrive is not backup, it&#x27;s sync). And I don&#x27;t want to be reminded later. I don&#x27;t want to be reminded ever. All this fuzzy language makes me feel like I&#x27;m dealing with a kindergarden teacher addressing his/her pupils.
It&#x27;s not my computer any more.
Oh, I update a driver. And 2 days later Windows installs an older version. Since when is 6.6.1.40 better than 6.6.1.72? Why would you do that?</span>

                              <span>I believe in hundreds, maybe thousands of years, after humanity has finally evolved past our current monkey mentality, future historians will look back at this time period in awe: &quot;They had the technology to make the sum of all human knowledge available to everyone... And they blew it! Further, they had the means to feed everyone, clothe everyone, house everyone, but they just walked away in the other direction, purely to maintain existing economic power structures.&quot; The future historians are going to wonder how strong our ideology was that we sacrificed all of what we could have at the altar of our scarcity-based religion.

                              <span>There is no greater folly of contemporary human society than the purposeful restriction of such vast and easily shareable repositories of knowledge. Perhaps these schemes made sense in the past but with the advent of the internet and independent groups willing to fund all hosting fees, we should move to models of publishing that do not require this restriction of information. Library genesis exists but necessarily must hide and create some friction in the discovery process. A legally unencumbered free library of all books for all people would be the greatest achievement in all of human history. We prevent this achievement due to our attachment to a specific economic system that serves as the current means of financially supporting authors. We must build alternatives to for-profit publishing, and the only resilient and widely acceptable system I can imagine is one where every community owns and controls the means of production upon which they depend for their survival. In such an economic system, the need for automation would be obvious and once implemented, all people would receive the benefits of automation. This would include such a wide allowance for leisure and free time that authors would no longer need to restrict access to their books to extract profits from their value their shared knowledge creates. All people would be free to do what they will.
It would take great effort to build such a system, but open source and digital repositories of machine designs would ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The effort would still be substantial, but what hangs in the balance is the opportunity to assure the freedom of all people and the creation of the most significant repository of knowledge humanity has ever conceived of. If we succeed it will be our greatest achievement as a species.</span>

                              <span>Ah! My people.
I, too, much prefer a rebase-heavy workflow. It allows me to both have a dirty &quot;internal&quot; history and clean up for publication.
As a side-effect, it also makes me comfortable having a mostly linear-history for what I publish, as opposed to a many-branched, merge-heavy one, which I dislike, and makes history confusing.
I reject the argument that a no-rebase, merge-only history &quot;preserves the true history of how commits were created&quot;, because I believe that is irrelevant. What is relevant is what the tree looks like once the merge (or rebase) lands.
Should a merge conflict arise, in a rebase workflow the conflict resolution is folded into the rebased commit, so it looks like it was fine all along. In a merge workflow, the fix is in the separate merge commit. In both cases you still have to handle the merge conflict. And in my opinion it is not significant for the merge conflict resolution to be separate from the original commit itself because, again: what&#x27;s important is the final state of the repo.</span>

                              <span>We recently started using Waymo more often:
- Quality of Lyft and Uber rides have gone down significantly.
- Consistently spacious, clean and quiet cars. You know what you&#x27;ll get.
- AC always works and not up to the whim of the driver.
- No chatty driver to disturb our sleeping baby.
Negatives:
- Rides have usually 10% mark up over Lyft and Uber.
- Pick up and drop off tend to be a small walk from requested locations.
Forgot one more positive - you can choose a soothing music play list in the car and it automatically resumes in the next ride. Small but really nice detail when traveling with a baby.</span>

                              <span>My goto example of a dysfunctional and bureaucratic organization is an example I saw in a finance company I worked for.
I was a on team that we were doing a major project. We basically ran Kanban but had to run &quot;sprints&quot; so we chose 4 week sprints to get it out of the way and we put everything on the board we had to get done that month to stay on track. Our pipeline was setup in such a way that you were required to have a jira ticket to push a commit. We were really crushing our timeline, doing 2x the work we were expected, a really great team honestly. But we opened up bugs and additional features in the middle of our sprints to track our work as we did it.
What this amounted to was maybe us saying we have to do 40 tickets this month, and wed be closing like 80. Everyone should have been thrilled by this development! Well we had a sprint review where some &quot;Senior Project Manager&quot; That wasn&#x27;t really affiliated with our project but was some manager higher up was mad that us opening up new tickets mid sprint and closing them was ruining the org level burn down charts and expected delivery. They wouldn&#x27;t give up on this, and said it was our fault for not estimating better (which sure, but we were beating expectations!). So we did the reasonable thing and improved our estimates! No of course not, we doubled our number of tickets and filled in &quot;placeholder&quot; on half of them, and used them as needed then closed everything out at the end of the sprint, where we were congratulated by everyone for our phenomonal estimation.</span>

&gt; Knowing very little about USB audio processing, but having cut my teeth in college on 8-bit 8051 processors, I knew what kind of functions tended to be slow. I did a Ctrl+F for “%” and found a 16-bit modulo right in the audio processing code.
That feeling of saving days of work because you remember a clue from previous experience is so good.</span>

Title: The left of capital is sabotaging the anarchist movement: let’s fight back!

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

I don&#x27;t know... Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I&#x27;ve already failed?), seriously.
I&#x27;m a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I&#x27;m failing more.
I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things.

                              <span>bearblog.dev allows for open discussion and exchange of ideas in a low-stakes way. Putting my thoughts into writing on Bear means there are chances that some readers may open it and engage with it. At that moment, they are actively interpreting and making sense of it based on their own background. I find it liberating to release my raw text entries into the world and see what resonates or sparks new internal discussions for others. There is also a sense of relief in getting ideas that have been swirling in my mind out in the open. Once published, it feels like a task completed. While I don&#x27;t necessarily stay involved in conversations about my posts, I appreciate seeing the ripple effects as others reflect on or debate the topics.</span>
