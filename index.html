                              <span>Carr has long opposed net neutrality, insisting it created burdensome and overreaching regulations to govern the internet.  One reason Carr might have chosen not to consider net neutrality was that the Supreme Court decision, Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council (June 2024), limited the FCC&#x27;s power in ambiguous territory like net neutrality. A month after the Chevron decision, the Ohio Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals delayed the reintroduction of net neutrality. More

                              <span>In 1989,  US forces invaded, conquered, and occupied Panama, replacing its pet dictator, Manuel Noriega with a new regime.  Then-president George H.W. Bush’s justifications for the invasion included protecting US citizens in Panama and prosecuting the ill-conceived and ill-fated US war on drugs. The more likely reason is that Noriega, after many years of obedient service to his US masters, had increasingly become his own man (not necessarily in good ways, but that wasn’t the issue — he was plenty bad before, too).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about the notion of &quot;reasoning locally&quot; recently. Enabling local reasoning is the only way to scale software development past some number of lines or complexity. When reasoning locally, one only needs to understand a small subset, hundreds of lines, to safely make changes in programs comprising millions.
I find types helps massively with this. A function with well-constrained inputs and outputs is easy to reason about. One does not have to look at other code to do it. However, programs that leverage types effectively are sometimes construed as having high cognitive load, when it in fact they have low load. For example a type like &#x60;Option&gt;&#x60; carries a lot of information(has low load): we might not have a set of user ids, but if we do they are unique.
The discourse around small functions and the clean code guidelines is fascinating. The complaint is usually, as in this post, that having to go read all the small functions adds cognitive load and makes reading the code harder. Proponents of small functions argue that you don&#x27;t have to read more than the signature and name of a function to understand what it does; it&#x27;s obvious what a function called last that takes a list and returns an optional value does. If someone feels compelled to read every function either the functions are poor abstractions or the reader has trust issues, which may be warranted. Of course, all abstractions are leaky, but perhaps some initial trust in &#x60;last&#x60; is warranted.</span>

                              <span>Christmas of 1981 in Athens, Greece. I was 15. Father had died 3 years ago from heart attack at 42. His last words to my mother: &quot;Educate the kids&quot;.
She did her best, given that my grandfather was old fashioned and had stopped her from going to school after she became twelve, although she was among the smartest in her class.
That Christmas she had bought me the brand new then Sinclair ZX81 personal computer. We were visiting the grandparents in a small village near Athens.
I spend the night by the fireplace with a small portable TV and the machine, typing in games published in the UK PC magazines of that time and occasionally watching the Chrstmas shows. Debugging my typos was the way I learned how programming works.
Nothing really interesting here, but I am remembering that night again and again so when I saw the prompt I felt I should share. Merry Christmas everyone.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m Jewish, so all my Christmas&#x27;s growing up were kinda the same.  Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor&#x27;s house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys.  Sometimes we&#x27;d go out for Chinese food and a movie.
But my favorite was Christmas 1999.  My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too).  I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville.
I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon.  The timing lined up perfectly to see all three.  About 50 other people were there to do the same thing.  When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late.  This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies.
About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off.  Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies.
That was a great day.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve made more friends more easily in my 40s than any other time in my life, and I&#x27;m a relatively quiet and disagreeable person.
Making connections with people you&#x27;re around frequently is easy. The problem is that adult life doesn&#x27;t throw you into those situations post-college outside of work.
Now it&#x27;s on you. Find a group. Sports are the easiest. You will absolutely make strong, long lasting friendships if you play sports. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re athletic or talented.
You just gotta show up and see the same people every week over and over. If you&#x27;re a reasonably well adjusted person (and even that sometimes doesn&#x27;t matter) you will make friends.
Again, making connections and friends is easy. Being around the same people regularly is difficult. Solve that problem and the friendships will come with little effort.
I have found that people generally understand the value of friendship and are welcoming to newcomers. It&#x27;s been a very refreshing surprise as I&#x27;ve gotten older.
Get out there!</span>

                              <span>- No serious hedge funds or other activists involved in this, ie no adults involved, check
- Fully audited financials not being questioned, check
- CEO and CFO constantly acknowledging the Foundary unit wasn&#x27;t profitable in quarterly updates, check.
The former CEO was brought in to to try and keep Intel a fully integrated business that designed and manufactured chips.  He was very clear upfront about his plan to not divest the foundry and instead to try and build it back up.
It didn&#x27;t&#x27; work, that&#x27;s not a crime.  He left because his plan didn&#x27;t work.  That&#x27;s what happens to CEO&#x27;s who try and fail to implement a business plan.
This is just an ambulance chaser lawsuit that doesn&#x27;t look like it will go anywhere at all.
If there was any merit at all then the board would also be involved in going after the former CEO and CFO.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;42500195">

                              <span>This question reminds me of the first time I met a blind programmer.
I asked him how he managed to code, and he replied with something that stayed with me: a good programmer should organize software in such a way that every piece of code has a clear and logical place. The organization should be so intuitive that anyone could build a mental model of the structure and navigate it easily, even without seeing it.
It felt like something out of a Yoda or Mr. Miyagi lesson. Skeptical, I asked his colleagues if he was truly able to code or if he was just exaggerating. To my surprise, they told me not only was he capable, but he was the best programmer they had ever worked with. They said no one else came close to writing code as organized as his.
That conversation changed my perspective. Ever since, whenever I’m unsure where to place new code, I don’t think about DDD or any specific methodology. Instead, I try to follow the logic and structure of the project in a way that feels natural and easy to follow later.
Later in life, I met two other blind programmers and heard similar stories about their ability to produce well-organized code.
To bring this back to the original question: I view LSP/IDE features the same way those programmers view &quot;visual aids.&quot; Code should be organized according to a clear and logical structure that makes it easy to navigate.
Relying on features like Ctrl+Click to find where things are located worries me. Why? Because it can mask structural flaws in the codebase. If we can&#x27;t intuitively figure out where something belongs, that’s a sign the codebase lacks structure—and that should motivate us to refactor it.
Not only do I avoid using LSP features, but I’m also opposed to their use. While they can help with navigation, they may prevent developers from experiencing and addressing the underlying structural issues in their code.</span>

This is the idea that capitalist production moves in cycles, not just in booms and slumps every 8-10 years or so, but also there are longer periods of generally faster accumulation and output growth ie periods of relative prosperity followed by a periods of relatively slower accumulation and growth, with more recessions. These longer cycles or waves last around 50-60 years including the (...)

Just today I used a completely local AI research tool, based on Ollama. It worked great.
Maybe it won&#x27;t get much better? Or maybe it&#x27;ll take decades instead of years? Ok. I remember not having these tools. I never want to go back.</span>

                              <span>The original answer to &quot;why does FastMail use their own hardware&quot; is that when I started the company in 1999 there weren&#x27;t many options. I actually originally used a single bare metal server at Rackspace, which at that time was a small scrappy startup. IIRC it cost $70/month. There weren&#x27;t really practical VPS or SaaS alternatives back then for what I needed.
Rob (the author of the linked article) joined a few months later, and when we got too big for our Rackspace server, we looked at the cost of buying something and doing colo instead. The biggest challenge was trying to convince a vendor to let me use my Australian credit card but ship the server to a US address (we decided to use NYI for colo, based in NY). It turned out that IBM were able to do that, so they got our business. Both IBM and NYI were great for handling remote hands and hardware issues, which obviously we couldn&#x27;t do from Australia.
A little bit later Bron joined us, and he automated absolutely everything, so that we were able to just have NYI plug in a new machine and it would set itself up from scratch. This all just used regular Linux capabilities and simple open source tools, plus of course a whole lot of Perl.
As the fortunes of AWS et al rose and rose and rose, I kept looking at their pricing at features and kept wondering what I was missing. They seemed orders of magnitude more expensive for something that was more complex to manage and would have locked us into a specific vendor&#x27;s tooling. But everyone seemed to be flocking to them.
To this day I still use bare metal servers for pretty much everything, and still love having the ability to use simple universally-applicable tools like plain Linux, Bash, Perl, Python, and SSH, to handle everything cheaply and reliably.
I&#x27;ve been doing some planning over the last couple of years on teaching a course on how to do all this, although I was worried that folks are too locked in to SaaS stuff -- but perhaps things are changing and there might be interest in that after all?...</span>

When people think of a binary translator, they usually just think of the ISA aspects, as opposed to the complicated interactions with the OS etc. that can consume just as much (or even more) engineering effort overall.</span>

You would probably look weird at an software that installs itself in C:\MYAWESOMEAPPLICATION instead of using the Windows program folder like literally every other piece of software (except for legacy stuff like LTSpice). Creating visible directories in the home folder without asking is the Linux equivalent of doing just that.
Check if the XDG environment variables are set and store your stuff in these places — as it is now can be used as a last resort fallback. For reading config/data you do the same.</span>

                              <span>Complete aside here: I used to do work with amputees and prosthetics. There is a standardized test (and I just cannot remember the name) that fits in a briefcase. It&#x27;s used for measuring the level of damage to the upper limbs and for prosthetic grading.
Basically, it&#x27;s got the dumbest and simplest things in it. Stuff like a lock and key, a glass of water and jug, common units of currency, a zipper, etc. It tests if you can do any of those common human tasks. Like pouring a glass of water, picking up coins from a flat surface (I chew off my nails so even an able person like me fails that), zip up a jacket, lock your own door, put on lipstick, etc.
We had hand prosthetics that could play Mozart at 5x speed on a baby grand, but could not pick up a silver dollar or zip a jacket even a little bit. To the patients, the hands were therefore about as useful as a metal hook (a common solution with amputees today, not just pirates!).
Again, a total aside here, but your comment just reminded me of that brown briefcase. Life, it turns out, is a lot more complex than we give it credit for. Even pouring the OJ can be, in rare cases, transcendent.</span>

                              <span>I wonder if the new drug of choice is actually technology. In some ways I think that the addiction to technology has some similar mellowing effects as drugs. Some research indicates that smartphone addiction is also related to low self-esteem and avoidant attachment [1] and that smartphones can become an object of attachment [2]. The replacement of drugs by technology is not surprising as it significantly strengthens technological development especially as it is already well past the point of diminishing returns for improving every day life.

                              <span>Efficiency is now key.
~&#x3D;$3400 per single task to meet human performance on this benchmark is a lot. Also it shows the bullets as &quot;ARC-AGI-TUNED&quot;, which makes me think they did some undisclosed amount of fine-tuning (eg. via the API they showed off last week), so even more compute went into this task.
We can compare this roughly to a human doing ARC-AGI puzzles, where a human will take (high variance in my subjective experience) between 5 second and 5 minutes to solve the task.
(So i&#x27;d argue a human is at 0.03USD - 1.67USD per puzzle at 20USD/hr, and they include in their document an average mechancal turker at $2 USD task in their document)
Going the other direction: I am interpreting this result as human level reasoning now costs (approximately) 41k/hr to 2.5M/hr with current compute.
Super exciting that OpenAI pushed the compute out this far so we could see he O-series scaling continue and intersect humans on ARC, now we get to work towards making this economical!</span>
