                              <span>Millions of Brazilians woke up on August 31 in a country without X, after the Supreme Court ordered the national telecommunications agency to block the social media platform. This move culminated over a year of X&#x27;s refusal to follow Brazil&#x27;s telecommunications laws, particularly those requiring deplatforming of suspects in internet crime investigations. In a single day, X lost 22 million users, while alternative platform Blue Sky gained 2 million new Brazilian users in just three days. The order to ban the platform initially came from Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, a figure vilified by the Bolsonaros and the international far right, and was ratified by a 5-0 vote in the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1st working group three days later.

That is understandable, since Gustave Eiffel’s master piece has been the emblem of the city for a long time. However, the tower is also a symbol of the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie, the “capitalist class”, a patriciate whose exclusive ranks also happen to include the ladies and gentlemen of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). A soupcon of history may help us to understand the centrality the tower in the recent Olympic extravaganza in the “city of light”. More

BearBoost is an Apple shortcut designed to help you boost your blogging.
It&#x27;s for all bloggers, but especially those who use the Bear blogging platform. The idea is to give you a quick and easy tool to help you get writing when you&#x27;re feeling stuck.
It&#x27;s like having your personal muse whisper, &quot;No more writer&#x27;s block! Let&#x27;s turn this blank page into a blog masterpiece!&quot; Okay, maybe not exactly that, but kind of.
The shortcut currently offers nine menu options:
Trending Posts (Bear discovery feed)
Recent Posts (Bear discovery feed)
Ten Topics (pick one and start writing)
Daily Prompt (via Kevin McDonald)
Random Prompt (from Blog Prompts)
Random Quote (from Random Quotations)
Today’s Word (via Merriam-Webster)
Blog Inspiration (a page of mine)
Discover Blogs (the blog directory)
I&#x27;ll likely add more features over time. If you have any requests, please let me know.

Whenever we are separated, regardless for how long, I unconsciously begin a countdown in my mind until I see her again, even it it&#x27;s just from the beginning of the work day until lunch. I&#x27;ve never known anyone as well as I know her. I can tell her mood from the sound of her footsteps as she descends the stairs from our bedroom into the living room. Neither of us ever attempt to hide an emotion from the other, so intune we are with each other&#x27;s feelings.
My wife is a classic introvert. Our home is her haven, the place where she recharges her batteries. I long ago accepted the responsibility for answering every knock at the door and being the one to deal …</span>

An attacker not only needs your username and password, they also need physical access to your key. They then have to disassemble the device. If they want to give it back to you, they&#x27;ll need to reassemble it.
So not exactly trivial!
A blob of nail-varnish over a plastic seam might be a useful canary.
But this does highlight one weakness of these FIDO tokens - you have to manually maintain a list of where you&#x27;ve registered them. And if your token is lost or stolen, you have to manually revoke every single one.</span>

                              <span>I found this interesting:
&gt; Another option is to put it to beneficial use to create heat or even electricity. The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.
And towards the end
&gt; Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere... But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.
I love reading about landfills. I wish more environmentalists would be excited about engineering solving environmental ills and relied less on knee-jerk reactions.</span>

                              <span>So obviously claiming that there&#x27;s no good reason for process to read argv[0] is either demonstrating the author&#x27;s ignorance or needs a much stronger defense; I&#x27;d be fascinated to hear how they think busybox should work on an OpenWrt box with a 16MB root filesystem.
However, I am willing to consider the discussion about whether there could be merit to restricting the ability to write that value; I could imagine a system that populated it only from the actual file name and did not allow it to be written by the parent process or the child process at runtime. The obvious place this still falls apart is that an attacker could just
    ln /bin/curl ./some\ other\ name

but there are sometimes security measures that we use even though they&#x27;re less than 100% effective so it at least conceivable that this might be a trade off worth making.</span>

                              <span>Scenarios where an IDE with full syntactic understanding is better:
- It&#x27;s your day to day project and you expect to be working in it for a long time.
Scenarios where grepping is more useful:
- Your language has #ifdef or equivalent syntax which does conditional compilation making syntactic tools incomplete.
- You just opened the project for the first time.
- It&#x27;s in a language you don&#x27;t daily drive (you write backend but have to delve in frontend code, it&#x27;s a 3rd party library, it&#x27;s configuration files, random json/xml files or data)
- You&#x27;re editing or searching through documentation.
- You haven&#x27;t even downloaded the project and are checking things out in github (or some similar site for your project).
- You&#x27;re providing remote assistance to someone and you are not at your main development machine.
- You&#x27;re remoting via SSH and have access to code there (say it&#x27;s a python server).
Yes, an IDE will save you time daily driving. But there&#x27;s no reason to sabotage all the other usecases.</span>

For the past decade-plus I have mostly only searched for user facing strings. Those have the advantage of being longer, so are more easily searched.
Honestly, posts like this sound like the author needs to invest some time in learning about better tools for his language. A good IDE  alone will save you so much time.</span>

                              <span>The post-COVID years have not been kind to professional forecasters, whether from the private sector or policy institutions: their forecast errors for both output growth and inflation have increased dramatically relative to pre-COVID (see Figure 1 in this paper). In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.</span>

                              <span>Rust and Javascript and Lisp all get extra points because they put a keyword in front of every function definition. Searching for “fn doTheThing” or “defun do-the-thing” ensures that you find the actual definition. Meanwhile C lacks any such keyword, so the best you can do is search for the name. That gets you a sea of callers with the declarations and definitions mixed in. Some C coding conventions have you split the definition into two lines, first the return type on a line followed by a second line that starts with the function name. It looks ugly, but at least you can search for “^doTheThing” to find just the definition(s).</span>

                              <span>I suspect it tests your monitor and monitor calibration as much as your color perception. In particular, sRGB displays have a pretty severely limited green gamut. If you have a wide-gamut display, the test is probably gonna appear different.
But another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window, which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we&#x27;re staring at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do &quot;auto white balance&quot; that skews the results. It&#x27;s the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.
To address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller, or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.</span>

                              <span>I think this is flawed. You quickly end up on a color that&#x27;s clearly not &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;green&quot; and you&#x27;re unlikely to keep hitting &quot;this is green&quot; several times in a row, conceding that ok, fine, maybe this is blue, whatever. You&#x27;re basically measuring how many times people are willing to click the same button in a row.
Edit: Possible improvements: changing the wording to &quot;this is MORE green&quot; and &quot;this is MORE blue&quot; and randomizing the order in which they are shown, somehow. I realize you&#x27;re just doing some kind of binary search, narrowing the color range.
This is not to mention color calibration of your monitor, or your eyes adjusting / fatiguing to the bold color over time...</span>

                              <span>i dont like getting asked &quot;what have you been up to?&quot;. i don&#x27;t know. i could have had the most interesting past few days, or the most uneventful, and i would simply not remember. my memory is slim these days, and comes to me in fleeting moments when i can form links with events in the present. sitting here in the sun the sun sends me back to the beach i was on this summer. the embrace from a friend brings the scent of the perfume my grandmother used to wear. the unassumed path we bike on takes me to my mom&#x27;s hometown. i wonder at times if i only remember things by association.

i&#x27;ve been doing a lot of things recently, which has been nice. i&#x27;ve been seeing friends and getting out of the house most days. at times i wonder if this is what life is supposed to be all about; these joyful moments shared with others, kept a secret from the rest of the world. i don&#x27;t take many photos when i&#x27;m out like that. my mom gets mad i don&#x27;t have anything to show for my outings. having a photo of the occasion makes me feel like i have cheated myself out of a memory by constraining it to a handful of pixels. who do i need prove i had a good time to?</span>

                              <span>Since I started blogging in January, I&#x27;ve invested time in several different communities, starting with OMG.LOL, followed by Microblog, Scribbles, r/MacApps, r/Obsidian, BearBlog, 500.social and the Blaugust Discord. The most personal of these are the Mastodon community around OMG.LOL, Scribbles and Microblog. The two Reddit communities are the most impersonal. As in any group environment, I have personal interactions with other people and with groups of other people. I also get to watch interactions where I&#x27;m not directly involved because of the way the Internet is structured.
Some of my rules are:
Stay out of other people&#x27;s fights
Never ignore racism, homophobia or misogyny
Never go &quot;Well, actually…&quot;
Give lots of complements
Offer sympathy
Answer questions
Avoid taking sides unless moral…</span>

                              <span>You generally want to minimize the number of passwords you manage; for instance, you should generally be paying the SSO tax and getting as many services as you can onto OIDC. After that, just do the cloud version of 1Password, which is easy to audit and manage access for, which you&#x27;ll thank yourself for when it comes time to SOC2.
Remember, as you give people access to passwords, that those passwords will need to be rotated when those people change to incompatible roles or depart the company. If passwords aren&#x27;t a total pain in the ass for you, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.</span>

An expert told him to hire experts to keep growing it. Now he&#x27;s down to two locations, high in debt and uncertainty.
Corpo bois are not founders, they know nothing of growing a startup. The have never produced value from thin air. They are just good at playing the corpo role. Job security is their main concern.</span>

&gt; You will not be forced to work inside something known as a “virtual environment.”
Oof, this terrible advice cancels out an otherwise reasonable post. Beginners who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing are the last people who should be &#x60;pip install -r requirements.txt&#x60;-ing into the system Python the way this article is recommending. That&#x27;s not only going to make working on multiple projects nearly impossible (especially for the kind of beginning students who get recommended Anaconda, which are almost always the Data Science-y crowd using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit, etc, which are notoriously finicky with version conflicts), but it stands a good chance of breaking other Python-based system utilities in completely opaque ways. This sort of advice can fubar a naive user&#x27;s entire workflow.
I know virtualenvs suck to explain to people, but in my opinion it needs to be done before you ever tell them about &#x60;pip install&#x60;.</span>

                              <span>I grew up seeing founder mode first-hand.  My dad founded Celestron, and he operated just as Paul is describing.  At my current company, I see the CEO doing the exact same thing, which gives me great hope.  Huge contrast from my previous start-up, for which I have great anti-hope unfortunately.  (Current company is Zap Surgical Systems, with Dr. John Adler as the founder.)  I&#x27;ve seen John everywhere, all day every day.  I&#x27;ve seen him literally on his hands and knees under our robotic treatment table back in the engineering lab, discussing details with a young mechanical engineer.  And yeah, we are curing cancer ;-)
To re-iterate:  What I believe PaulG is saying is that there is a crucially important phenomenon that we don&#x27;t yet understand, and naming it will facilitate the process of bringing it into focus so that we can help more companies be successful.
His footnote has a painful resonance:  &quot;I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it.&quot;
This is exactly what has happened to the Agile methodology.</span>

                              <span>You have to work hard and come up with new ideas better than anyone else in the world, and demonstrate that. Then IEEE asks A review the work of B and B review the work of A for free. If the work is good, IEEE will ask you to transfer your rights to your intellectual property to IEEE, and sometimes pay on top of that too. Of course, you have to pay exorbitant fees to present it. Lastly, you can’t download your own paper from IEEE and must pay IEEE through a subscription or per article. So, IEEE takes your work and sells it back to you. Meanwhile, the access is not open in 2024, and there is a lot of unpaid volunteer activity, typically by local students and academics.
Why? We give you a professional home!
The cost of the online dissemination is minimal, and the events and societies are run mostly by the communities.
Academia always seemed to be a fraud in some ways.</span>

                              <span>Key Ideas:
Heavier vehicles are safer for their occupants but more dangerous for others: The weight of a vehicle is a critical factor in car crashes, with heavier vehicles causing more fatalities in other cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
The heaviest vehicles kill more people than they save: Analysis of crash data shows that for every life saved by the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks, more than a dozen lives are lost in other vehicles.
Weight advantages have changed little over time: Despite improvements in safety features, the weight advantage of heavier vehicles has remained relatively constant, with heavier vehicles still causing more fatalities in lighter vehicles.
Carmakers prioritize consumer preferences over safety: Manufacturers are producing increasingly heavier vehicles, driven by consumer demand for larger, more powerful cars, despite the safety risks to others.
Regulators are ill-equipped to address the issue: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s rating system focuses on occupant safety, not the safety of other road users, and tax policies subsidize heavier vehicles.
Public awareness and concern are growing: Surveys show increasing concern about the size and safety of SUVs and pickup trucks, with researchers and policymakers starting to take notice.
Electrification may exacerbate the problem: The shift towards electric vehicles, which tend to be heavier than their internal-combustion equivalents, may increase the weight of vehicles on the road, further amplifying the safety risks.</span>

                              <span>Counter-example: Reed Hastings, co-founder and the CEO of Netflix for 22 years, famously did the opposite of what pg is saying.  Reed insisted on a particular style of employee freedom &amp; responsibility that IMO set the benchmark for innovating year after year and avoiding micro-managers, even as it scaled up past 2000 engineers. This story still has not been fully told.  Reed was closely involved but perhaps the opposite of Steve Jobs.
Sounds like chesky and pg want to turn the tide on that dominant culture in software companies.  And I couldn&#x27;t agree more!  A big problem IMO is that most &quot;professional software managers&quot; are taught a management style that focuses on risk.  Risk-aversion permeates every decision from compensation to project priorities.  It&#x27;s so pervasive it&#x27;s like the air they breathe, they don&#x27;t even realize their doing it.  This is how things run in 99% of companies.
So, my fellow hackers.  There is a better way.  It&#x27;s neither the Steve Jobs model nor the John Sculley model.  Looks like pg has not yet found it.  I hope he does, though.  It would be great for YC to encourage experimentation here.</span>

                              <span>I was once so angry that I reached this current level of understanding English, the level you see right now.
It was in the summer of 2016.
I wasn’t particularly angry at the time, until a certain event occurred. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.
During that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) and tried to read it.
I didn’t have my laptop, internet, TV, or even a paper dictionary at the time. I was furious and struggled to read the book.
On my first read, I understood only about 1-5% of the entire book. But I kept going. As I struggled…</span>

I’ve been complaining about being ill sometimes, about specific symptoms, about being unable to do stuff and being stuck in bed so much.. and the response I seem to get (whether outright or implied) is like “Duh, you are chronically ill, of course this is happening.” Like it’s the most normal thing in the world. As if everyone has already known it for ages and has readily accepted it, but I am lagging behind. “Get with the program already!”

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about something lately. Something that&#x27;s the complete opposite of how I usually do things — and it feels really good.
It&#x27;s primarily the work on the Bearming theme that made me realize this. Before, I always wanted to have the whole picture clear in my mind beforehand. I tweaked and fiddled, turned it this way and that before finally deciding to release something.
There&#x27;s been this idea that &quot;everything has to be perfect.&quot; This has resulted in spending a huge amount of time before pressing the publish button. There are several problems with such an approach...
For one thing, there is no external feedback whatsoever when I&#x27;m sitting and tinkering behind closed doors. It becomes a limited creation process with a very narrow perspective. A one-man show for something that&#x27;s intended for an audience.
Another problem with creating &quot;for my eyes only&quot; is that the public announcement will never get a response that matches the time spent on the project. It leads to a feeling of scarcity, that it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ve spent all this time, and this is all I get?
The new approach for me of creating publicly feels incredibly liberating and refreshing. I first released a beta of the theme and have since refined it and added new things along the way. Having a changelog also reinforces the feeling of continuity and development on a creatively rewarding level.
I&#x27;m going to try to implement the same mindset with my entire blog. Revisiting old posts, reviewing the content, maybe adding tags or an image, and so on. A never-ending project without timeframes.
Bits and pieces that slowly, one step at a time, make for a more detailed and interesting picture – that&#x27;s the kind of digital painting I want to keep creating.</span>

Osa, a 13-year-old lab/pit mix had a swollen stomach and was moving around very gingerly. Her condition had not changed by this morning and he elected to take he to the emergency vet&#x27;s office in his neighborhood. The two of them were not gone long when he returned, grim faced. &quot;She&#x27;s dying&quot; he told me.
Osa survived the removal of stomach tumors three years ago. Now they have returned and in such profusion and size that removing them at her age isn&#x27;t a practical option. my granddaughte,r who lives in Virginia had an October trip already planned to come home for a visit with Osa, the family dog since she was in kindergarten.

Servers are holding up so far! Fortunately we were overprovisioned. If we hit 4mm new signups then things should get interesting. We did have some degradations (user handles entering an invalid state, event-stream crashed a couple times, algo crashed a couple times, image servers hit bad latencies) but we managed to avoid a full outage.
We use an event-sourcing model which is: K/V database for primary storage (actually sqlite), into a golang event stream, then into scylladb for computed views. Various separate services for search, algorithms, and images. Hybrid on-prem &amp; cloud. There are ~20 of the k/v servers, 1 event-stream, 2 scylla clusters (I believe).
The event-stream crash would cause the application to stop making progress on ingesting events, but we still got the writes, so you&#x27;d see eg likes failing to increment the counter but then magically taking effect 60 seconds later. Since the scylla cluster and the KV stores stayed online, we avoided a full outage.</span>

                              <span>The step-up in cost basis on death is the original sin that underpins the entire debate over unrealized gains.
It&#x27;s disheartening to see so much thought and deliberation going into an obviously toxic idea (taxing unrealized gains) when the obvious solution (removing the cost basis step-up when assets change hands) is being ignored.
Inherited wealth is the least earned, so it should be politically palatable to change this. But presumably because such a change would acutely affect the people who make laws in the country specifically, it is never seriously considered.</span>

                              <span>I worked for about a year with a consulting firm that handled &quot;Y2K compliance&quot;. Unlike this Andersen exercise in legal face-saving, it was a real job. Big companies hired us to do a full inventory of their site equipment (this included manufacturing plants, Pharma stuff) and go line by line with their vendors and figure out which components had known Y2K issues, which had not been tested at all, and which ones were fine/had simple fixes. We helped them replace and fix what needed to be fixed.
Y2K was a real problem. The end-of-the-world blackouts + planes falling from the sky was sensationalism, but there were real issues and most of them got fixed. Not trying to take away from this very interesting story of corrupt cronyism, but there were serious people dealing with serious problems out there. &quot;Remember Y2K? Nothing happened!&quot; is a super toxic lesson to take away from a rare success where people came together and fixed something instead of firefighting disasters.</span>

But I did not know about the technicalities (wtf is RSS?) and the culture of blogging. And although it took some time to set this whole endeavor up2, it is the culture-thing that is the hardest for me.
I am used to Twitter and Bluesky, where posts have to be short and draw attention. This combination rewards posts that say divisive shit3 and punishes those that are nuanced and complex. It is easier to wish death onto some asshole politician than to explain what they did wrong. If you want to write something personal or sincere you have to meme and/or bury it under ironic detachment.

In mid-July, I wanted to find a way to challenge myself in August for my birthday month. I initially wanted to do a photo challenge (a photo a day?) of sorts. As I was trying to figure out what to do, it was happenstance to have come across someone posting about Blaugust: A Festival of Blogging. I had no idea what it was but then I read this bit under What is Blaugust?:
The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world.
I knew I just had to try it.
And here we are.

UPDATE: Herman just added a comment in the nolt suggestion that locations are now removed, and there is a corresponding commit.
A new uploaded photo shows that EXIF metadata (including location) is now removed:

Thanks Herman for the fast work! 💨
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.

                              <span>Have posted this before, but it really left an impression about crows, and the bond between their mates:
Years ago I was putting out the garbage in the back alley behind our building where I lived on the 8th floor. A crow attacked me out of the blue. Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me. Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building. That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me. It was a little spooky.
When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley. The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony. On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape. Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.
I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder. To this day it still amazes me that the crow&#x27;s mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Finally, I’d like to end this piece with a comment on the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand and I have held dear for years, and is still on our About page to this day, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o&#x27;clock-news reporting. It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers by providing high-quality content
That’s the core of it. And too bad they’re off. Finding a news outlet that isn’t “tweeting” an article and isn’t a blog post on HN was great. And while they mention Tom’s hardware. It always felt (to me) less verbose where I needed it.

Within a few weeks, I had dug an old laptop out of my dad&#x27;s bin of &quot;stuff work wasn&#x27;t using anymore&quot; and I managed to put Ubuntu on it. I think it was an HP. I don&#x27;t remember the exact specs but I do remember that the GPU was failing, there were weird video glitches all the time, and the battery held a charge for about 15 minutes.
That was my first experience with Linux. That broken-ass computer was what I used when I learned Arduino. I&#x27;m now a firmware engineer, writing this comment on my work laptop, which is running Ubuntu.</span>

                              <span>Extremely sad. There basically is nothing like Anandtech; the depth, the ability to explain, the lack of sensationalism, and the integrity in benchmarking (I still vividly remember when they noticed an issue with HPET in Windows affecting their benchmarks, and promptly pulled all of them offline until they could reassess). Chips and Cheese is great but only covers a certain segment of it.
In the end, I would assume it just boiled down to lack of money. There were people among us who would gladly pay for this kind of coverage, but Anandtech said at some point they had considered it and couldn&#x27;t find a good model. (As an aside, I pay for LWN, and I would pay for something that covered similar areas to Phoronix but actually was good.)</span>

                              <span>Earlier today I was reading some new posts by Visa. There’s not much to say about that, except that he uses pretty normal words and writes very well.
This might seem like an odd comment, but it stems from my reading of another post, A Brief Case on Bearblog. The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.
This thought reminded me of an excellent essay by Paul Graham, Write Like You Talk. In it, he argues that if you want people to connect with you, you must write in a way that feels familiar to them. Essentially, the essay rests on the assumption that we all speak similarly but think differently.

                              <span>A month ago, I decided to shut down this blog. The next day I changed my mind, which I wrote about in the post &quot;The blog that refuses to die.&quot;
Yesterday, I launched a membership called Birming Buddies. When I woke up this morning after a long and good night&#x27;s sleep, I realized it didn&#x27;t feel right. I have now removed the page.
It probably sounds crazy – and maybe it is.
But neither the decision to start Birming Buddies nor to shut down the blog were impulsive actions. It&#x27;s always been a long period of consideration before I hit the OK button. Once I&#x27;ve done that, I quickly realize whether it was the right decision or not.
It&#x27;s as if I can&#x27;t reason my way through some decisions. I have to put them into action to really be able to determine what is right and what is not. Not very practical, I know, but that&#x27;s apparently how I work.
Anyway, no harm done. The member fees are  refunded and the blog lives on. And I&#x27;ll continue to develop the Bearming theme. Today I released an add-on to show excerpts of your blog posts (see example on my home page), and a new color palette named Green Screen.
I hope you have the patience to continue following my rather crooked blog journey. Hopefully, the transparency will bring some comfort to those who can relate.
By the way, I also launched a newsletter today. Subscribe now, who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll delete it tomorrow ;)
I wish you a wonderful weekend!</span>

                              <span>Ruby has a surprising hack in its interpreter. If the file starts with a shebang line, ruby will skip all lines until it encounters a shebang line which contains the string &quot;ruby&quot; in it.
This lets you start out as a shell script and then after some setup switch over to ruby
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

There is some ugliness to this hack though. The interpreter only looks for the word &quot;ruby&quot; so the shebang line could be whatever including.
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/I/am/a/rubyist
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

will work but
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/bin/rb
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

will result in a print of &quot;no Ruby script found in input&quot;
Source: ruby.c#L2681
I am not a fan of such hacks in a language. Python lets you do something similar too - but it takes advantage of the fact that triple-quoted strings are side-effect free in Python and &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;: is the same as just a : which is two empty strings followed by a true in bash.
#!/bin/bash

source /path/to/venv/bin/activate.sh

exec python $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

 We met Denys and members of the Crane Operators Union in spring 2021, during online meetings and exchange of experience between unionised operators in Poland and Ukraine. At the time, protests were underway in both countries over pay rises and improved workplace safety in this sector. Ukrainian operators regularly informed about our actions and expressed solidarity in their social media. We wrote about the s…</span>

 If, for any number of reasons, you’d like to burn telecoms to the ground and build a new internet service provider on their smoldering remains, good news for you. New York City Spectrum workers, who’ve weathered an anguishing four-year strike, have built their own internet service provider. If the city throws its support behind it, People’s Choice Communications could liberate New Yorkers from cable gangsters once and for all. 
 The city itself is almost constantly fighting Spectrum. With its rise to dominance in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tried to evict it; attorneys general had to chase it around for allegedly defrauding…</span>

Please introduce yourself to our readers
 My name is Kostya, I am a student of the second grade. [Kostya lives in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine.] 
How did you experience the beginning of the war?
 In fact, I sensed that a full-scale invasion would soon occur, but I did not expect it to be so large and destructive. I remember the beginning very well. My mother asked me to buy food, which was practically non-existent, and told me to stay at home. The first week was very scary, nobody knew what was going to happen.

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …</span>
