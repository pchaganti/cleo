Its steps are to create a Greater Israel; destroy Hamas, Hezbollah and other adversaries in Iraq, Syria and Yemen; and quash Iran&#x27;s budding nuclear program.  Over the past 12 months, that plan has unfolded successively in four principal locations: Gaza, the West Bank (and East Jerusalem), Lebanon and now Iran.

4.20 will let you run some of our components on another compositor. We mostly test with Wayfire and Labwc, as our compositor will also be using wlroots.</span>

                              <span>Since discovering my favorite types of blog posts are essay-like in anatomy and length, I&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of time to both writing and reading such posts. Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I&#x27;ll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I&#x27;ll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I&#x27;ve really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don&#x27;t always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.
When I post something in the morning, I&#x27;ll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don&#x27;t have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it&#x27;s a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I&#x27;ve also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me. I feel really good after blogging, and I don&#x27;t ever want that to change.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

                              <span>With the world at war, the feeling that the international system has failed humanity is increasing. The challenges posed to international law and the United Nations are structural—a minority of violent, militarized governments dictate the terms and play by their own rules. But can the will of the majority result in real change?

I detest email spam and have been looking into tried &amp; true solutions for obfuscating email addresses. Contact forms are great for hiding email addresses, but I don&#x27;t love relying on yet another service for something so simple as email.
It turns out a simple CSS &quot;display: none&quot; blocks 100% of spam! I&#x27;ll be using this method to list my email address moving forward — you can see how it looks on my About page.
The symbol substitution method seems to still be effective, but I want my email address to be easy to copy-paste.
Here are the HTML and CSS snippets for anyone interested in hiding their email address from spam bots.
HTML for email address
Add this to where you want your email to display. Update username and domain.com with your actual information.
username@mail.domain.com

Theme CSS
span.email b {
    display: none;

                              <span>Unlikely Upvote Button for Bear
Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven&#x27;t liked, your posts?
Say hello to the &quot;unlikely&quot; button. It works like the standard button but doesn&#x27;t display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post&#x27;s popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: &quot;☆&quot;;
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: &quot;Like it?&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: &quot;★&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: &quot;Thank you!&quot;;
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}

Title: Black and Red Rags
Date: 3 Oct 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/black-red-rags/

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…</span>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day. 
 Şehîd Tekoşer will always remind us of the fallen comrades,
 the beauty of struggle and the price of the defense of freedom.
 With our grief, we celebrate Lorenzo’s life …</span>

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…</span>

 When I first started my journey as an anarchist, I was incredibly privileged in both my environment and upbringing. I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. 
 Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…</span>

                              <span>Hey: it&#x27;s this story again. As someone who&#x27;s around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I&#x27;ve always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama&#x27;s sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also:
* I went to university and had a great time there
* I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly.
* I talk to women and have had romantic relationships.
* I&#x27;ve had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software.
* While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I&#x27;d say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.
I know DMD severity varies between patients, but I don&#x27;t want this article to discourage people with DMD or with children that have DMD. It can be tough, but I think that modern treatments allow us to lead fairly rich lives outside of Warcraft.</span>

                              <span>FWIW Jeffrey Zeldman is a living legend. He was one of the first print designers to transition to the web, did it well, and wrote about it constantly. He designed the “Batman Forever” website in 1995; it was visited by something like one-third of all Internet users.
He created the Web Standards Project, hugely influential in getting browser manufacturers to support standards rather than pee in the pool. And if you think cross-browser support today is rough, at the time you could reliably crash production browsers with valid CSS.
Never mind A List Apart, one of the best early mailing lists on the web, a kind of transitionary form between Usenet and forums/Discord. And A Book Apart, which published lots of high-quality stuff.
If you develop for the web today, every time a browser behaves as the spec describes, thank Jeffrey Zeldman.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;41749960">

                              <span>To recap OpenAI&#x27;s decisions over the past year:
* They burned up the hype for GPT-5 on 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can&#x27;t quickly replicate.
* They dissolved the safety team.
* They switched to for profit and are poised to give Altman equity.
* All while hyping AGI more than ever.
All of this suggests to me that Altman is in short-term exit preparation mode, not planning for AGI or even GPT-5. If he had another next generation model on the way he wouldn&#x27;t have let the media call his &quot;discount GPT-4&quot; and &quot;tree of thought&quot; models GPT-5. If he sincerely thought AGI was on the horizon he wouldn&#x27;t be eyeing the exit, and he likely wouldn&#x27;t have gotten rid of the superalignment team. His actions are best explained as those of a startup CEO who sees the hype cycle he&#x27;s been riding coming to an end and is looking to exit before we hit the trough of disillusionment.
None of this is to say that AI hasn&#x27;t already changed a lot about the world we live in and won&#x27;t continue to change things more. We will eventually hit the slope of enlightenment, but my bet is that Altman will have exited by then.</span>

                              <span>Sorry time: years ago I worked on a telemedicine web app before telemedicine was nearly as popular as it is today. Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.
Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.
Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.
Since then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers.</span>

                              <span>Since Robert Birming released his Timeline design, I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and including it in some of my pages.
But I was also curious on how I could include it to make a microblog out of a typical Bearblog. Not that you can&#x27;t make short posts on here in a default look, but most of the design of Bearblog and its themes is decidedly for longform content. I wanted something that looks more like a microblogging/short post platform.
&#x3D;&#x3D;Some goals I had in mind for my own microblog:&#x3D;&#x3D;
I didn&#x27;t want these low effort posts to be in the Discovery section; make_discoverable has to be false in the Post preset.
The posts need to mention when they were made; I need to include {{ post_published_date }} in the h4 of the Timeline code.
I want the main page you land on to display the most recent …</span>

                              <span>When I was a child, I grew up in a hoarder home. My mother had me at 16. We lived with my grandmother and her then wife, who kept everything she ever received. I have vivid memories of two things in that house.
The first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.
 

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.

Still a shitty move to mandate RTO. Most people (IT folks) have spoke with do this routine:
0) daily routine to prepare for day
1) 1 hr commute to shitty office
2) login to computer, do calls with cross regional (and international) teams over Zoom/Teams/Webex or whatever conferencing system
3) teleconferencing with boss or manager
4) teleconferencing with company stakeholders
5) work on features and push code to remote systems (VCS, CI/CD…)
6) eat shitty food at nearby places, or use the low quality vending machines or cafeteria
7) logoff
8) 1 hr commute back home
There are _some_ roles which may require in-person. But those were mostly sales folks. Some IT folks that deal with physical assets did require RTO (ie, data center / network engineers).</span>

Several winners have actually asked that the payout be donated back to other organizations fighting patent trolls. This isn&#x27;t intended to be anyone&#x27;s full time job. It is intended to reward technical people with industry knowledge who may be able to help surface prior art and are as sick of patent trolls as we are.</span>

                              <span>I do MRI work, and my gut is that none of the claims about dance vs. exercise would replicate. The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors&#x27; behavioral data doesn&#x27;t show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...
The brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I&#x27;m referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don&#x27;t reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors&#x27; claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p &#x3D; .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p &gt; .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.
In general, my priors on &quot;we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period&quot; are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.</span>

                              <span>Reading between the lines, my uneducated guess is that Sable knew they were going out of business either way and had to chose between paying ALL of Cloudflare&#x27;s legal fees (possibly in the millions) or paying a token amount and giving up their (now or soon-to-be worthless) patents. The latter results in fewer financial loses for Sable and makes for excellent Cloudflare PR.
Edit: Also, it&#x27;s entirely likely that Sable still made a tidy profit overall when it settled with the other big networking companies and decided to quit while they were ahead.</span>

                              <span>Nothing, because .io was operated by some wheeler-dealer without the authority of the UK. Apparently he just dumped money into the bank accounts of the various overseas territories he was selling the domain names for and they were OK with it?
He&#x27;s since sold it on and now a hedge fund owns it.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io
Officially, the British Indian Ocean Territories will cease to exist, therefore so would the ISO 2-letter country code. However, ccTLDs have outlasted countries before, notably &quot;.su&quot; for the no longer existing USSR. I suspect that IANA would prioritise not breaking millions of domain names over trying to police ccTLDs.
Google&#x27;s view on the matter is that .io is already effectively a gTLD rather than a ccTLD, like with .nu, .to, .tv, as most of the registrants run websites with a global audience or at least an audience other than the island nations whose ccTLDs they are.</span>

&gt; There&#x27;s lots of very exciting work going on around the fully mapped fruit fly connectome. For example, I&#x27;m a CTO of a stealth startup that aims to do for utilitarianism what carbon credits did for environmentalism. We are selling &#x27;utility credits&#x27; which translates directly into us simulating trillions and trillions of fruit fly brains in a state of constant orgasmic bliss, which you can then buy to offset any actions your company has undertaken that damage global happiness or well-being. We&#x27;ve seen a lot of interest from some pretty large industry players.

Just so happens that the &quot;love centre&quot; is also the &quot;vomiting centre&quot; along with a load of other stuff. I&#x27;d treat this hand-wavy claim with the same kind of skepticism - your counter-example is an excellent one.

This is interesting to me. It does make some evolutionary sense but at the same time, i wake up every morning and look at my girlfriends face, hopefully that does not subconsciously trigger the same response.

                              <span>Hi Matt, great that you&#x27;re participating here and I&#x27;m broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine&#x27;s conduct.
However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites.
To be entirely blunt it&#x27;s all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it&#x27;s because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance.
If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE&#x27;s conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It&#x27;s not going to go away on its own.</span>

                              <span>Matt - i&#x27;m not your lawyer, but you should shut up.
Employers generally have an obligation to keep personal data confidential, especially sensitive information like a job application.
Whether that applies in this particular case or not, i&#x27;m not going to offer an opinion, but you really should shut up.
I get that it&#x27;s particularly frustrating and hard to feel like you are being unfairly treated or whatever, but shut up anyway.</span>

                              <span>Howdy, Matthew Charles Mullenweg from the lawsuit here.
One thing I&#x27;m surprised they disclosed is on page 35 that Heather Brunner at WP Engine was interviewing for a job at Automattic. That&#x27;s why we were spending so much time together 1:1 without her team there in the meetings I posted here: https://automattic.com/2024/10/01/wpe-terms/
They lied that it was to run WordPress.com, though, she wanted to be the Executive Director of WordPress.org for Automattic, a position that was held by Josepha.</span>

                              <span>Connectome-adjacent neuroscientist here. Definitely not a dead end! But also definitely not the whole picture.
One of the main open questions in neuroscience right now is how network structure, dynamics, and function are related in the brain. Connectomes provide tremendous insight into structure, but as mentioned this does not generically solve either the dynamics or function problem. For example, for many of these neurons we don&#x27;t have a good understanding of their input-output relationship, and the nature of this relationship can strongly affect the dynamics that emerge in a highly connected network. Individual variability across connectomes, and how connectomes change over development are also a significant issue, but at least for the fly it&#x27;s thought that many of the basic structures are pretty conserved across adult animals, even if many of the details could differ.
Modulo these caveats, knowing the physical network structure of the brain does still impose huge constraints on what kinds of models we should be using for gaining insight into dynamics and function. For example, there are well known areas (the &quot;mushroom bodies&quot;) with specific feed-forward connectivity patterns that are very different from a random recurrent network. Further, there are at least some areas in the fly brain where we think there are indeed quite clean structure-function relationships, e.g. in the central complex of the fly brain, which contains a physical ring of neurons and is thought to support a &quot;bump&quot; of activity that acts as a sort of compass that helps flies navigate via a ring-attractor-like dynamical system. Thus, even though it has many missing pieces, a wiring diagram like this can be tremendously useful for generating hypotheses to guide more targeted experiments and theoretical studies.</span>

                              <span>Always cool to see new mutex implementations and shootouts between them, but I don’t like how this one is benchmarked. Looks like a microbenchmark.
Most of us who ship fast locks use very large multithreaded programs as our primary way of testing performance. The things that make a mutex fast or slow seem to be different for complex workloads with varied critical section length, varied numbers of threads contending, and varying levels of contention.
(Source: I wrote the fast locks that WebKit uses, I’m the person who invented the ParkingLot abstraction for lock impls (now also used in Rust and Unreal Engine), and I previously did research on fast locks for Java and have a paper about that.)</span>

                              <span>&gt; The reason why Cosmopolitan Mutexes are so good is because I used a library called nsync. It only has 371 stars on GitHub, but it was written by a distinguished engineer at Google called Mike Burrows.
Indeed this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of nsync, but Mike Burrows also wrote Google&#x27;s production mutex implementation at https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/synchr... I&#x27;m curious why this mutex implementation is absent from the author&#x27;s benchmarks.
By the way if the author farms out to __ulock on macOS, this could be more simply achieved by just using the wait(), notify_one() member functions in the libc++&#x27;s atomic library.
A while ago there was also a giant thread related to improving Rust&#x27;s mutex implementation at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93740#issuecomment-.... What&#x27;s interesting is that there&#x27;s a detailed discussion of the inner workings of almost every popular mutex implementation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lived in neighborhoods with a Homeowners Association1 all my life. There were times I found having one to be advantageous, but these days it&#x27;s just plain annoying.
The house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

                              <span>Carmel by the Sea is such a cute little town—super quaint and dog-friendly! We spent the day here for my birthday back in August.
Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

I was feeling rather cooped up earlier so I went out for a walk. Smack in the pouring rain. Thankfully, my sneakers were worn and in need of replacing so getting them soaked wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal; still, one is forced to ask oneself if they&#x27;re capable of making good life decisions when the wind starts howling against your umbrella.

This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.

In supplemental questions to the February 2024 Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), we asked a representative sample of U.S. residents about their experience with genAI tools.

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.</span>
