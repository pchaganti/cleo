                              <span>I am a high school dropout and who learned math using Khan Academy after never having completed more than pre-algebra in middle school.
Sal Khan’s work changed my life and allowed me to build a foundation in not only math, but also finance and economics, that allowed me to feel confident enough to go to college. I did not have a support system or people in my life who could teach me these things, but I had the internet and patience, which meant I had opportunities that did not exist even a few years before (this was in 2014).
Now I work in AI and generally have a life I could not have dreamed of. Every time I go to the grocery store to buy something and don’t have to worry about my card being declined, it feels like magic. Even years later.
If I had been in that situation a few years earlier, my life would be very different.
I’m excited to live in a world where my daughters and countless others will have a tutor that can help them maximize their potential throughout their lives. I’m excited not only for them, but for society. What a time to be alive.</span>

                              <span>Veterans constitute a significant segment of the male labor force, and understanding labor market disparities between veterans and non‑veterans is an important component of studying disparities in the economy as a whole. In a previous Liberty Street Economics post, we have shown that even relative to a group of comparable non-veterans, veterans have lower employment and labor force participation rates. One year later, we see that veterans continue to experience lower labor market attachment and the employment gap has widened, though the earnings gap has closed.</span>

Universities are now viewed as businesses, students as clients, and faculty as a serf-like, casual labor force. Furthermore, administrative leadership has regressed, modeling itself after hedge fund managers and embracing a market-driven ideology that believes the irrational belief that the market to solve all problems and control not only the economy but all aspects of social life.

                              <span>In the fall, I&#x27;ll be moving to a new city to pursue graduate studies. I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.
Next week I&#x27;m flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it&#x27;ll be just me, in a new city. I&#x27;m excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I&#x27;m really on my own.
I moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it&#x27;s time for me to leave; I&#x27;ve been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I&#x27;m in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).
It&#x27;s a big step, despite something I&#x27;m excited for. Yet very scary. But if I&#x27;m scared to do it, it&#x27;s exactly because I&#x27;m scared that I should do it.
I think I&#x27;m ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.
The (paper) journal I&#x27;ve kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It&#x27;s as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.
I&#x27;ll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?</span>

There&#x27;s a really common sentiment that using pre-made or llm generated decks can&#x27;t replace creating your own.
This is probably true. Writing your own flashcards forces you into a state where you have to actually think and organize the concepts together in your head into things that are digestible.
Often the flashcards that people create are not conducive to review. It&#x27;s hard to create cards that aren&#x27;t easy to remember the &quot;shape&quot; of later on instead of actually remembering the content. And drilling one small piece of the puzzle doesn&#x27;t fill in the rest of the pie.
LLMs are sophisticated enough now to generate variations on flashcards on-demand. But nobody has wired up LLMs natively with spaced repetition for learning.

We flew ANA from LAX to Tokyo and United Airlines on the way back. The ANA meals were more Japanese and tasted better than the UA ones.
I noticed the Rolls Royce logo on the turbines on of our plane. Maybe they manufacture them?




My first photograph in Japan! No surprise that it&#x27;s of public transit. I love how accessible and easy to use the metro system is. The subway cars are unbelievably clean and well-designed.

Ginza
I spent my first day in Ginza, near where I stayed. Ginza is cleaner, glitzier Fifth Ave: lots of luxury stores and boutiques, not a lot in the way of (r…</span>

                              <span>People that use mouth dildos annoy the shit out of me. Either commit and smoke a cigarette, or give it up.
I hate smoking. I think it&#x27;s fucking disgusting and I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to do it. I especially hate it when there&#x27;s a gaggle of smokers huddled around the front door of a pub, tooting away on their fags. It&#x27;s vile and I don&#x27;t want my pink fluffy lungs affected by that shit.
But do you know what I hate more than smoking?
Mouth dildos.
What the fuck is a mouth dildo?
-- Everyone
This is a mouth dildo:

Not only do you look ridiculous putting that stupid fucking contraption in your mouth, but the plumes of flavoured vapour that bellow from these things make you look even more like an utter cunt.
I don&#x27;t want to be subjected to the cherry ice cream vapour pouring from your mouth dildos, seemingly by the bucket load. At least smokers are committing, knowing they&#x27;re gonna kill themselves, have decided to enjoy it while they&#x27;re here.
But you mouth dildo fuckers are the worst. We don&#x27;t want to smell your stupid fucking vape. So put it away because you look (and smell) like a dick head.
Peace ✌🏻

                              <span>Besides the Godzilla trilogy, I haven&#x27;t watched any full anime series for the past few years. Thanks to the YouTube algorithm, I discovered a gem of a series called Ranking of Kings. I was drawn in by the beautiful animation style and the intriguing premise of a deaf-mute boy named Bojji aiming to become king. On a whim, I started the first episode. Right from the opening scenes, I got engrossed in this fantastical yet grounded world. Bojji&#x27;s kind spirit shone through despite his adversity. By the end of the episode, I was already invested in his journey. I&#x27;m now 11 episodes into the first season and loving every minute. His bond with Kage also struck a chord. All the other characters are so compelling, too, even the ones I initially disliked. The animation by studio WIT is also a visual treat.</span>

&quot;We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson.&quot;
Is he trying to suggest the company did not try to make the voice sound like her without her permission?
The statement sounds like it&#x27;s written by a lawyer to be technically true while implying something that is actually false.
These are weasel words.
He sounds sneaky, evasive and intentionally deceptive.
We should not give a sneaky, deceptive and manipulative person this much power over our future.</span>

                              <span>Gordon was the first investor in my first startup, the first guy that believed in us.
Even though I only met him later in his life he was still sharp as a tack, never lost the mind of the engineer. Sometimes it&#x27;s best not to meet your heroes but Gordon lived up to the hype and then some.
Super gentle, generous with his time, the consummate gentleman.
One of my fondest memories from my startup years was enjoying dinner with Gordon and his wife in Sydney, she made the most amazing cookies. To this day I don&#x27;t think I have had a better cookie haha.
Visited the computer history museum with him once for a bit of a VIP tour I guess. So many stories about PDPs and all the friends he made along the way.
Thanks for all the stories and memories old man, you have earned your rest.

It&#x27;s absolutely rediculous that supporting something, thats opt-in not opt-out is causing a ruckus lol, people really have too much fuckin time on their hands to bitch about things.
This is like bitching that Firefox allows us to enable a proxy server, and throwing a fit that a feature exists even as an option to be enabled.</span>

                              <span>&gt; A portion of this code implemented a SMTP client.
If I wanted to root cause this, the real problem is right there.  Implementing protocols correctly is hard and bugs like in the post are common.  A properly implemented SMTP client library, like one you would pull off the shelf, would accept text and encode it properly per the SMTP protocol, regardless of where the periods were in the input.  The templating layer shouldn&#x27;t be worrying about SMTP.</span>

Don&#x27;t remember why I was subscribed to the bug, must have commented on it or something. Got the occasional email notification about it over the years, always got a chuckle out of it. Then a couple of days ago, lo and behold, it was fixed!</span>

                              <span>This explains exactly why physical restaurant menus are so much better vs mobile site menus. If I&#x27;m viewing the menu of a restaurant on my phone, I always look in Google Maps for someone who took a picture of the menu, because it&#x27;s a dense UI. Every &quot;mobile friendly&quot; menu site is able to show maybe 5 items on the page at once, so it takes many pages of scrolling to see everything.</span>

                              <span>It really is incredible how something as small and simple as this gives such incredible bad vibes. This is like early 2010s facebook vibes. It&#x27;s just... if they&#x27;re going to steal her voice, what would they do to yours?
But it also points to a wider problem in OpenAI&#x27;s existence. They&#x27;re built on theft. If you wrote something on the internet in the last 20 years, they&#x27;ve stolen it. They&#x27;ve stolen it, they&#x27;re put it into their little magic box and now they want to sell it back to you. OpenAI is amazing technology, and once the equity of the company is redistributed back to the content owners who actually provided the value, it&#x27;ll be great to see what they can do from there.</span>

Speaking at a protest near Sen. Chuck Schumer’s home in Brooklyn last month, Naomi Klein said: “We don’t need or want the false idol of Zionism. We want freedom from the project that commits genocide in our name.” More

                              <span>The thing about the situation is that Altman is willing to lie and steal a celebrity&#x27;s voice for use in ChatGPT.  What he did, the timeline, everything - is sleazy if, in fact, that&#x27;s the story.
The really concerning part here is that Altman is, and wants to be, a large part of AI regulation [0].  Quite the public contradiction.

                              <span>This statement from scarlet really changed my perspective. I use and loved the Sky voice and I did feel it sounded a little like her, but moreover it was the best of their voice offerings. I was mad when they removed it. But now I’m mad it was ever there to begin with. This timeline makes it clear that this wasn’t a coincidence and maybe not even a hiring of an impressionist (which is where things get a little more wishy washy for me).</span>

                              <span>Well, that statement lays out a damning timeline:
- OpenAI approached Scarlett last fall, and she refused.
- Two days before the GPT-4o launch, they contacted her agent and asked that she reconsider. (Two days! This means they already had everything they needed to ship  the product with Scarlett’s  cloned voice.)
- Not receiving a response, OpenAI demos the product anyway, with Sam tweeting “her” in reference to Scarlett’s film.
- When Scarlett’s counsel asked for an explanation of how the “Sky” voice was created, OpenAI yanked the voice from their product line.
Perhaps Sam’s next tweet should read “red-handed”.</span>

                              <span>I would say the compiler explorer[0] fits the definition perfectly. It may seem like a straightforward piece of software, but it has immensely changed the way people discuss and share knowledge around compilers and performance optimization.
I regularly feel the impact on the quality of forum discussions. There&#x27;s a lot less speculation about if &quot;call X gets inlined&quot;, or &quot;Y gets vectorized&quot;. Bold claims can be supported or disproven quickly by sharing a link. And then you have tools like llvm-mca[1] or uiCA[2], if you don&#x27;t mind going into the weeds.

                              <span>&gt; We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it.
It is indeed frustrating that one still cannot search effectively a local device, but it doesn&#x27;t need AI to solve. It needs a proper search engine, and Microsoft has resisted that, for some mysterious reason, for 30+ years.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Their &quot;copilot&quot; brand is so weird and... muddled.
Microsoft can&#x27;t brand anything cleanly and unambiguously.
&quot;MSN Messenger&quot; / &quot;Windows Messenger&quot; / &quot;Windows Live Messenger&quot; / &quot;Microsoft Lync&quot;
&quot;Internet Explorer&quot; / &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; / &quot;MSN Explorer&quot;
Windows 95 email client &quot;Exchange&quot; / email server platform &quot;Exchange&quot;
&quot;Outlook&quot; / &quot;Outlook Web Access&quot; / &quot;Outlook Web App&quot; / &quot;Outlook.com&quot; / &quot;new Outlook for Windows&quot;
&quot;Microsoft Teams&quot; / &quot;New Microsoft Teams&quot;
&quot;Office Communicator&quot; / &quot;Microsoft Lync&quot; / &quot;Skype for Business&quot; / &quot;Skype&quot; / &quot;Skype for Business Online&quot; / &quot;Skype for Business for Microsoft 365&quot;
The most guffaw-inducing branding, to me, was the recently-announced remote desktop client called &quot;Windows App&quot;. That&#x27;s going to be an easy one for users to search for.
(For guffaw-inducing I suppose there&#x27;s also the Windows 98-era &quot;Critical Update Notification Tool&quot;[0])

More editing because I can&#x27;t stop myself:

There&#x27;s the AI code assistant thing that github actually started, there&#x27;s the horrible chatbot maker GUI demoware, there&#x27;s AI stuff you might be able to do with your sharepoint (if only you could get hold of the right ms sales rep to take your money), there&#x27;s an app that does genai things on your personal MS account... And now there&#x27;s a Surface rebrand?
That org chart meme about Microsoft being little fiefdoms pointing guns at eachother never stops being relevant.

 I wrote about how difficult it was to get from Kyiv to Lviv on the first day of a full-scale war in the novel THE MINING BOYS. But when I finally got there, it only got worse. 
 The people who sheltered me sincerely did not understand why I did not want to defend the country with weapons in my hands. My hope to go to Europe seemed like a betrayal to them. At the same time, I had to hide from them not only my fear, but also my culture and my orientation. 
 These same people advised me to voluntarily join the territorial defense. Their acquaintances, who also didn’t want to fight, deliberately signed up there so they wouldn…</span>

                              <span>Back in the glory days of the internet, when social media was just becoming mainstream, I used to blog regularly. I would write and publish a post anywhere from 1 - 3 times a week.
I didn&#x27;t monetize my blog and I had no dreams of my personal site becoming a business. It was simply a place for me to share things that were on my mind and lessons learned from books I was reading.
Fast forward many years and what we have is the current state of the internet.
Everything is an ad. Everyone is an influencer. And the algorithms determine what we see and dictate what we post. And for some reason they insist on the entire population becoming video producers.
It&#x27;s an endless game that I lost my taste for long ago.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m attempting to blog again. I need somewhere to get my thoughts and opinions out without distraction and without too much tech.

                              <span>A direita, os anarcocapitalistas (embora este termo seja discutível) e a extrema-direita brasileira, diante do crime ambiental praticado no Rio Grande do Sul, conseguiram emplacar uma bela história: o povo pelo povo.
É muito importante salientar como o povo brasileiro se uniu para ajudar o povo do Rio Grande do Sul. É reconfortante observar que o próprio povo, especialmente os mais pobres, uniu-se no próprio RS para ajudar os outros. Voluntários que não têm muito em casa saem às 5h para atender 12h em um abrigo onde as pessoas perderam tudo. Isso é significativo, especialmente após o período de 2018 a 2023, em que o Brasil parecia uma poça de sangue (e ainda parece, em certa medida), pois mostra que o povo ainda é solidário, mesmo que precise de uma tragédia para uni-los.

The approximately 100 Apple workers were also the first in the nation to successfully form a union. They did so in 2022, as the Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (CORE), joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Two-thirds of the store’s workers voted to join the union, a resounding success at a company that has long staved off union activity. More

                              <span>Supply chain disruptions became a major headache for businesses in the aftermath of the pandemic. Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.</span>

Source: Retrieved on 19 May 2024 from anarchyinaction.org/index.php?title&#x3D;Anarchy_in_the_Haitian_Revolution

 Following many years of hidden and small-scale resistance, African slaves in the French colony of Saint Domingue (or San Domingo) rose up in 1791 against their colonizers and slave masters. By 1804, they abolished slavery, expelled the French colonizers, and established the independent republic of Haiti. Haiti was the name given to the Caribbean island by the Tainos before colonizers arrived, slaughtered the entire indigenous population, and imported African slaves. 
 While the 1776 and 1789 revolutions of the USA and France were grounded in exclusionary “citizens’ rights,” the Haitian Revolution stood out for a com…</span>

                              <span>Since as early as Kubernetes v1.7, the Kubernetes project has pursued the ambitious goal of removing built-in cloud provider integrations (KEP-2395).
While these integrations were instrumental in Kubernetes&#x27; early development and growth, their removal was driven by two key factors:
the growing complexity of maintaining native support for every cloud provider across millions of lines of Go code, and the desire to establish
Kubernetes as a truly vendor-neutral platform.
After many releases, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce that all cloud provider integrations have been successfully migrated from the core Kubernetes repository to external plugins.
In addition to achieving our initial objectives, we&#x27;ve also significantly streamlined Kubernetes by removing roughly 1.5 million lines of code and reduci…</span>

                              <span>If you like this, it&#x27;s also worth looking at llama2.c[1], an implementation of the Llama 2 architecture in about 1000 lines of plain, dependency-free C, tokenizer and all. THe fact that this 960-line file and a somewhat modern C compiler is all you really need to run a state-of-the-art language model is really surprising to many.
Of course, this is not all there is to a modern LLM, it would probably take another thousand lines or two to implement training, and many more than that to make it fast on all the major CPU and GPU architectures. If you want a flexible framework that lets a developer define any model you want and still goes as fast as it can, the complexity spirals.
Most programmers have an intuition that duplicating a large software project from scratch, like Linux or Chromium for example, would require incredible amounts of expertise, manpower and time. It&#x27;s not something that a small team can achieve in a few months. You&#x27;re limited by talent, not hardware.
LLMs are very different. THe code isn&#x27;t that complicated, you could probably implement training and inference for a single model architecture, from scratch, on a single kind of GPU, with reasonable performance, as an individual with a background in programming and who still remembers their calculus and linear algebra, with a year or so of self study. What makes LLMs difficult is getting access to all the hardware to train them, getting the data, and being able to preprocess that data.</span>

                              <span>Disclaimer: I used to work at a live video streaming company as a financial analyst so quite familiar with this
The biggest cost is as you imagine the streaming - getting the video to the viewer.  It was a large part of our variable cost and we had a (literal) mad genius dev ops person holed up in his own office cave that managed the whole operation.
Ive long forgotten the special optimizations he did but he would keep finding ways to improve margin / efficiency.
Encoding is a cost but I don’t recall it being significant
Storage isnt generally expensive. Think about how cheap you as a consumer can go get 2 TB of storage, and extrapolate.
The other big expense - people!  All those engineers to build back and front end systems. That’s what ruined us - too many people were needed and not enough money coming in so we were burning cash.</span>

Here we go.
Hi, I&#x27;m Meï ! And welcome to this blog. Or this attempt at a blog.
It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil&#x27; kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.
A friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.
I used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.
As of late, I&#x27;ve been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I&#x27;ve been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn&#x27;t really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.
This built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.
So once again, here we go!
1. As a note, the &quot;Fucktopia&quot; is a reference to Souillon&#x27;s comic book &quot;Hello Fucktopia&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t find a listing in English, sorry! It&#x27;s available in French &amp; Spanish, at least..
My small rules of writing
Try to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.
Focus! I&#x27;m super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.
No stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let&#x27;s keep this place as my comfy Internet place.
Let&#x27;s hope it goes well. And I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this blog and its topics.

                              <span>A bear in a circus is interesting. So is a juggler and a man on the unicycle. A bear on a unicycle juggling swords on the other hand is something extremely unique. Something you would pay good money to see. A smart generalist is kinda like that.
A smart generalist is a person who is 80/20 across multiple fields. This means they have reached 80 Percent understanding/capability across multiple fields leveraging around 20 percent of the effort that would typically be needed to fully master it. It makes them unique.
The primary skill of a smart generalist is the ability to get from 0 to 80 in a new field quickly. They can quickly identify high ROI leverage points of a subject. It is a learned skill. They also have strong convictions that anything can be learned and learned fast. Even things considered &#x27;tough&#x27; by society.
On the other hand, we have the cracked specialists. People really good at one thing. Getting to the frontiers and advancing human knowledge. Creating absolutely beautiful works in that &#x27;one thing&#x27;.
It is a sliding scale. We all lie somewhere between a specialist and a generalist. But we could all do some good to realise we are not limited. We can do multiple things if we want to. It is easy to be hemmed in. To define your identity as &#x27;Software Engineer&#x27; or &#x27;Writer&#x27; or &#x27;XYZ&#x27;. That is what school teaches -&#x27;Specialisation&#x27;. But humans are versatile. We are the OG general intelligence. Capable of adapting and doing multiple things.
Don&#x27;t forget the &#x27;General&#x27; in General Intelligence.</span>

skipping openings just because you&#x27;re on a binge can so easily rob you of what i&#x27;d argue are the best narrative and collective highs a series can offer.1
from a purely functional standpoint, they give us time to breathe and process what exactly we&#x27;re watching. take, for example, the three versions of shippuden&#x27;s penultimate opening— blood circulator. each variant denotes which point of the story you&#x27;re at, and primes you for what&#x27;s to come. (if you pay attention, you&#x27;ll notice they lead into each other seamlessly! so neat.)

10 and a half beautiful years of his company. our kind, kind sherlock who sometimes snapped at us when we kissed him too much. our darling, darling boy who was great at finding toys we’d hide from him; who liked to eat the cheese crackers my grandma fed him when no one was looking.
he had chronic heart failure. we were counting down the months, really, but nothing could’ve ever prepared me for that 3am knock, his fading heartbeat, and his little eyes that wouldn’t close.

                              <span>(This open letter is inspired by a post I read yesterday by Gabby of woolgathering fame.)
Dear Gabby,
It’s not just you: getting over the fear of expectations is hard. I still struggle with it, after 300 something posts. I have a feeling I’ll never get completely over it, but here’s what’s helped me so far.
Posting a lot helps. I’ve posted so much nonsense on this blog that these days there’s not much I can do that will be worse than something I’ve written before. Somehow, I still have regular readers. Realizing that there are people out there still interested in what I have to say after all the good and not so good is a great comfort. From what you write, you seem to have discovered as much.
Another perk of having a large body of work is that each new piece you create becomes a smaller and smaller part of your entire oeuvre. When you’re first starting out, it feels like each creation you put out defines you. After all, if you only have one post, it’s the only thing people can judge you on. If you have a hundred, a wayward post is a drop in the bucket.
That said, wouldn’t you still want to see the creations your friends or favorite creators aren’t proud of? Or see their art even if it doesn’t quite fit the niche they’ve carved out for themselves? Everybody half-asses things in their own unique way. There’s a beauty in doing things imperfectly, too.
All that is to say, keep up what you’re doing. Creative inertia is a very real thing. You’re doing the right thing by posting, even if you feel like you’re just posting to break the streak of inactivity. Writing in any form begets more writing.
Anyway, welcome back to Bear! It’s good to have you back.
Yours,
misu</span>

 Today opposition is anarchist or it is non-existent. This is the barest minimum coherence in the struggle against an engulfing totality. 
 And while ten years ago the milieu generally called anti-authoritarian was largely syndicalist, those leftist residues are fading out altogether. Very few now find a vista of work and production at all liberatory. 
 As the smell of this false and rotting order rises to the heavens, registering an unprecedented toll on all living beings, faith in the whole modern world evaporates. Industrialism and its ensemble looks like it has been a very bad idea, sort of a wrong turn begun still earlier. Civilization itself, with its logic of domestication and…</span>

                              <span>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rose almost simultaneously in most economies around the world. After peaking in mid-2022, inflation then went into decline—a fall that was just as universal as the initial rise. In this post, we explore the interrelation of inflation dynamics across OECD countries by constructing a measure of the persistence of global inflation. We then study the extent to which the persistence of global inflation reflects broad-based swings, as opposed to idiosyncratic country-level movements. Our main finding is that the spike and subsequent moderation in global inflation in the post-pandemic period were driven by persistent movements. When we look at measures of inflation that include food and energy prices, most of the persistence appears to be broad-based, suggesting that international oil and commodity prices played an important role in global inflation dynamics. Excluding food and energy prices in the analysis still shows a broad-based persistence, although with a substantial increase in the role of country-specific factors.</span>

 Thomas Paine is one of the most maligned and least understood of men. One of the noblest minded of men in most respects, he has been represented for nearly a century as a groveling nature and a monster of iniquity. Supremely generous in all his public career, he is said to have been mean and self-seeking. Having refused to profit by the copyright of his religious and political works, he is called parsimonious. A rarely equaled friend of mankind, he is scorned as the enem…</span>

 Good people who hold opinions not commonly understood generally have a bad name. The world is ready to believe almost anything of a man except that he is a genuinely good man. If his life is stainless but unconventional, the world suspects some hidden shame or base motive. So far are most people from understanding or desiring what is true and right that the highest truth is often believed to be the lowest lie, and the purest right is looked upon as the blackest wrong.

 Because he changed into so many different suits during his long career, historians have not focused on the dashing radical orator Hugh O. Pentecost. 
 Born September 30, 1848 at New Harmony, Indiana, Pentecost was given his middle name for Robert Owen, whose followers had established the town as a Fourierist colony a generation earlier. His parents, Emma Flower and Hugh Lockett Pentecost, were of English descent, with many Protestant clergy in their family tree. Hugh moved at age two to Albion, Illinois, which was founded by his grandfather, Scarborough Pentecost, Jr.
