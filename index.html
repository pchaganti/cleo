I worry that the AI will not express anger, not express sadness, not express frustration, not express uncertainty, and many other emotions that the culture of the fine-tuners might believe are &quot;bad&quot; emotions and that we may express a more and more narrow range of emotions going forward.
Almost like it might become an AI &quot;yes man.&quot;</span>

Because its capacities are focused on exactly the right place to feel magical. Which isn’t to say that there isn’t real utility, but language (written, and even moreso spoken) has an enormous emotional resonance for humans, so this is laser-targeted in an area where every advance is going to “feel magical” whether or not it moves the needle much on practical utility; it’s not unlike the effect of TV news making you feel informed, even though time spent watching it negatively correlates with understanding of current events.</span>

Especially since this demo is extremely impressive given the voice capabilities, yet still the reaction is, essentially, &quot;But what about AGI??!!&quot; Seriously, take a breather. Never before in my entire career have I seen technology advance at such a breakneck speed - don&#x27;t forget transformers were only invented 7 years ago. So yes, there will be some ups and downs, but I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at the thought that &quot;14 months&quot; is seen as a long time...</span>

                              <span>I think the live demo that happened on the livestream is best to get a feel for this model[0].
I don&#x27;t really care whether it&#x27;s stronger than gpt-4-turbo or not. The direct real-time video and audio capabilities are absolutely magical and stunning. The responses in voice mode are now instantaneous, you can interrupt the model, you can talk to it while showing it a video, and it understands (and uses) intonation and emotion.
Really, just watch the live demo. I linked directly to where it starts.
Importantly, this makes the interaction a lot more &quot;human-like&quot;.

                              <span>The usual critics will quickly point out that LLMs like GPT-4o still have a lot of failure modes and suffer from issues that remain unresolved. They will point out that we&#x27;re reaping diminishing returns from Transformers. They will question the absence of a &quot;GPT-5&quot; model. And so on -- blah, blah, blah, stochastic parrots, blah, blah, blah.
Ignore the critics. Watch the demos. Play with it.
This stuff feels magical. Magical. It makes the movie &quot;Her&quot; look like it&#x27;s no longer in the realm of science fiction but in the realm of incremental product development. HAL&#x27;s unemotional monotone in Kubrick&#x27;s movie, &quot;Space Odyssey,&quot; feels... oddly primitive by comparison. I&#x27;m impressed at how well this works.
Well-deserved congratulations to everyone at OpenAI!</span>

It&#x27;s interesting that OpenAI is highlighting the Elo score instead of showing results for many many benchmarks that all models are stuck at 50-70% success.

So no matter what you think of their current AUP they reserve the right to update it to anything they like in the future, and you&#x27;ll have to abide by the new one!

                              <span>Years ago, over a decade ago now, I was a .Net developer. Microsoft introduced Entity Framework, their new way of handling data in .Net applications. Promises made, promises believed, we all used it. I was especially glad of Lazy Loading, where I didn&#x27;t have to load data from the database into my memory structures; the system would do that automatically. I could write my code as if all my memory structures were populated and not worry about it. Except, it didn&#x27;t work consistently. Every now and again a memory structure would not be populated, for no apparent reason. Digging deep into technet, I found a small note saying &quot;if this happens, then you can check whether the data has been loaded by checking the value of this flag and manually loading it if necessary&quot; [0]. So, in other words, I have to manually load all my data because I can&#x27;t trust EF to do it for me. [1]
Long analogy short, this is where I think AI for coding is now. It gets things wrong enough that I have to manually check everything it does and correct it, to the point where I might as well just do it myself in the first place. This might not always be the case, but that&#x27;s where I feel it is right now.
[0] Entity Framework has moved on a lot since then, and apparently now can be trusted to lazily load data. I don&#x27;t know because...
[1] I spat the dummy, replaced Windows with Linux, and started learning Go. Which does exactly what it says it does, with no magic. Exactly what I needed, and I still love Go for this.</span>

                              <span>i know, kind of random. 

these days, kids in the region where i live get chromebooks at school. 

many of my students, including the ones who are now in middle school, are not efficient typers, and in fact many of them are slamming their pointer fingers down on keys one by one, the younger ones not even remembering where any of the letters are even after countless repetitions of the same words. 

and don&#x27;t even get me started on their spelling skills. 
choice, import, and scissors, although i&#x27;ll cut some of the younger ones slack on scissors. 

something else i find pretty funny is that occasionally they&#x27;ll try to touch the screen on the desktop to navigate. 

and this is all coming from an area where many of the school districts are top in the nation. 

did you also know that kids nowadays are more susceptible to online scams and malware? 

and overall, kids throughout the nation are reading at a significantly lower level than they should be, even with schooling. 

that&#x27;s it from me, thanks for reading my rant:)</span>

                              <span>There is nothing in this world that is easy. Everything requires a process, long or short, to get where we are today.
Allow me to name few things:
The ability to stand on both of your legs was the result of the development from crawling to standing
The ability to write and type is a result of constant practice and repeats
The ability to count is the result of constant effort to understand numbers
Nothing is easy, everything requires time and effort. We simply took granted for the simple things that have shaped us to be who we are today.</span>

My late uncle’s wife and daughter (my cousin) kindly joined us too. I mentioned how much I wanted to see my cousin in an earlier post. When we went to my uncle’s apartment with strawberries in hand to visit her I felt bad seeing the eye bags and stress lines written all over their face. In spite of all that, they invited us in and told us their side of the story while shedding tears. The details of his precipitously declining health and death were gruesome; I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying. I can’t imagine the whirlwind of emotions the last month has been for them.
That said, I was still really glad to see my…</span>

Almost two weeks ago, I wrote about catching a crawfish in the pond near Jiaozi Park, not far from where I live. My wife and I weren&#x27;t sure what to do - whether we should put it back or keep it. Ultimately, we decided to keep it and see how it fared.
I&#x27;m happy to report that the crawfish seems to be doing very well. We&#x27;ve noticed that it is molting. My wife even bought special food for it. It&#x27;s no longer afraid of us, either. Before, it would stop eating if we approached it, but now it continues eating even when we&#x27;re nearby. It comes quickly to the surface whenever we feed it, too.
We&#x27;re trying to make the crawfish feel comfortable in its new home. So far, it seems to be adjusting well. I&#x27;ll provide more updates as things progress.</span>

                              <span>&quot;And we ask: if your matrix multiply is smaller than 16x16, are you sure what you’re doing is AI?
From a philosophical point of view, we think a frame shift is in order. A “register” certainly shouldn’t be a 32-bit word like on the CPUs of old. And a 1024-bit wide vector register, as CUDA uses, is certainly a step in the right direction. But to us a “register” is a 16x16 tile of data. We think AI wants this.&quot;
The hardware needs of AI are starting to focus. GPUs, after all, were designed for an entirely different job. They&#x27;re used for AI because they have good matrix multiply hardware. &quot;AI GPUs&quot; get to leave out some of the stuff in a real GPU (does an H100 even have texture fill units?). Then there&#x27;s a trend towards much shorter numbers. 16 bit floating point? 8 bit? 2 bit? 1 bit? That will settle out at some point. This paper indicates that hardware that likes 16x16 tiles makes a lot of sense. It&#x27;s certainly possible to build such hardware. Someone reading this is probably writing it in VHDL right now, or will be soon.
Then we&#x27;ll see somewhat simpler, less general, and cheaper devices that do &quot;AI&quot; operations with as little excess hardware baggage as possible. Nice.</span>

I&#x27;m a Beatles fan. Tolkien was right to be skeptical, it would have been terrible. No doubt in my mind: campy, perfunctory, self-mocking. Please recall how &quot;nerd&quot; material was treated before the 2000s, if you&#x27;d like some precedent for what this would have looked like.</span>

                              <span>A few months ago there were articles going around about how Samsung galaxy phones were upscaling images of the Moon using AI [0]. Essentially, the model was artificially adding landmarks and details based on its training set when the real image quality was too poor to make out details.
Needless to say, AI upscaling as described in this article would be a nightmare for radiologists. 90% of radiology is confirming the absence of disease when image quality is high, and asking for complementary studies when image quality is low. With AI enhanced images that look &quot;normal&quot;, how can the radiologist ever say &quot;I can confirm there is no brain bleed&quot; when the computer might be incorrectly adding &quot;normal&quot; details when compensating for poor image quality?

                              <span>It is less like an alphabet, we already know that there is a discreet number of click clusters (basically an alphabet). Here they have found that the sperm whales modulate tempo of these clusters, rhythm within the clusters, add additional ornamental clicks, and change the rhythm of individual clicks within clusters over time (rubato). This adds an insane order of magnitude to their language much like our use of tone, context, and all the other ways we take our alphabet and enrich it with exponentially more meaning. This is the first time this has been proven in an evolutionary lineage separate from ours!</span>

                              <span>One thing that I think doesn&#x27;t get enough attention in these types of discussions -- not just this article about ROI, but also earnings disparities between (e.g.) genders and other groups -- is that income isn&#x27;t the only measure of happiness.
Many people would take less money to do a job they enjoyed more.  My older sister &quot;gave up&quot; a sales &quot;career&quot; to become a fiction writer.  It&#x27;s enough to pay the bills, but pays less than she could have had at a corporate job.  She got an English degree and couldn&#x27;t be happier with her choice.
My younger sister got a Theater degree and is a &quot;struggling actress&quot;.  Same deal: she&#x27;s happy with her choice.
ROI is important for some aspects of the discussion.  But it is not the whole story.</span>

The encampments have gone. Tall metal riot fences ring USC. Underpaid security hovers nervously at metal detectors. They paw through your bag when you enter, past the receipts, gum, phone, AirPods, and the overdue library book you never even opened. They’re searching for something. A tent? A Palestinian flag? A keffiyeh? A signed declaration of your commitment against genocide? What they are searching for is unclear, and it’s apparent they themselves don’t even know. The result is not the point; the display is. Like most college campuses, USC is invested in the performative, the circus act in all its summer and acrobatics and glory, something to distract us, for the moment, from the mundanity of reality. The mundanity that college campuses are really just another business: meaningless, archaic, and invested only in its commodification and profit.

China has considerable appeal in the Pacific as it offers market and donation benefits that are unencumbered by the regulatory millstones of Western countries, which are also offering deals like Australia’s “Step Up” initiative and development aid, and the US “Pacific Partnership Strategy” on diplomatic engagement and security. These projects have bigger geopolitical agendas than aid projects and are mainly concerned with countering China and undermining Pacific Island autonomy by setting up a donor-recipient dynamic.

There is not a whole lot to do here. With my uncle gone there’s no one to take us out; while healthy, my grandparents can’t walk for very long and neither can my mom. My brother and I are useless on our own. We don’t have a data plan, can’t pay for anything because we don’t have WeChat pay set up (I think you need a Chinese bank account), and can’t even download an offline map to help us get around. If we do go out on our own we’ll have to retrace our steps by memory.

There’s lots I recognize: strawberries and radishes caked in dust, cuts of red meat strewn on the road, fish floating upside down in kiddie pools, handmade combs and trinkets hanging from metal racks. Some things make me stop and stare: dogs in rusty wire cages (not for human consumption, I hope); caterpillars, segmented bodies still wriggling, best eaten alive; moonshine in repurposed plastic oil jugs.
If I dwell too long loud honks warn me to keep moving. The market is set up dangerously close to the road; traffic and marketgoers ebb and flow like deadly tides. Mom says my uncle was hit by a car in similar circumstances, which makes me jumpy. I try to give the vehicles weaving around us a wide berth, bu…</span>

Many of them have already been displaced two or three times. But all of them know nowhere is safe in Gaza now. There’s no refuge, no place free of bombs and tank shellings and sniper fire, no tent camp or temporary shelter with a reliable source of water or working toilets or beds or food, no mosque to pray in as death hovers all around.

                              <span>I feel I need to report my experience from Denmark, Jutland.
It started with white broad streaks, which most of all looked like fog, but then perhaps after 10 minutes or so, we saw colors of red, purple and green begin to emerge from the these streaks. Most astoundingly it all seemed to emanate from a fluctuating point in the middle of the sky. If you looked closely at this point  you could see it fall into itself, morphing and shifting continuously.
We went around the house and we could purple streaks at the top and orange to red patches at the bottom of the sky.
Colors observed:
Whitish blue,  
Green,
Purple,  
Red,
and Orange
An absolutely a beautiful experience.</span>

“Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. Pretty much everything I’ve done has had an aesthetic component, at least to me. Now you might think ‘well, building a company that’s trading bonds, what’s so aesthetic about that?’ But, what’s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right […] it’s a beautiful thing to do something right.”

I do a lot of volunteer work too. Guess what? My decisions in those roles are not unimpeachable. Being a volunteer also does not mean you are owed anything, even gratitude. It&#x27;s a thing you choose to do, and if you don&#x27;t like doing it anymore, then you should stop doing it.
Package maintainers aren&#x27;t self-sacrificial saints or all that unique as volunteers go.
This is a bad decision. It deserves criticism and discussion. The volunteer status of package maintainership is irrelevant.</span>

                              <span>Gutting the functionality that upstream has built into a piece of software and then publishing it under the same name is dubious at best.  If they want to go this direction they should publish as a fork under a different name so upstream doesn&#x27;t get constantly barraged by complaints of users having issues.
This reminds me of the time years ago when the Debian maintainer of Chromium decided to unilaterally disable the ability to install extensions.  Thankfully, more pragmatic minded people prevailed and the patch was reverted.
This also reminds me of a time many many many years ago when Debian removed the kernel interface that provided the ability to load binary firmware into network cards and broke networking for me.</span>

                              <span>Will be interesting to see how this affects math research.  He has pumped unthinkable amounts of money into the field.  The only first-class flights I&#x27;ve taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)
Besides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that&#x27;s just the stuff that I&#x27;ve benefited from personally. I know there&#x27;s more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I&#x27;ve never heard of. He was very good to us all.
We&#x27;ve always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.  Simons making $3 billion, the rest of us making 90k apiece.</span>

                              <span>When I was 15 I wanted to be a physicist really bad. My idol was Richard Feynman. I was convinced it was my passion. My purpose. I even made a PowerPoint presentation trying to convince my mom to let me be a physicist. She was not impressed. I could only be a doctor or engineer.
Now when I think about it I like physics but I don&#x27;t feel the same passion I had. I could switch fields and go into physics now. I don&#x27;t want to. It took a while to realise passion is a hoax. A fickle thing you can&#x27;t rely upon.
Only last month I saw a lot of posts on Twitter about AI safety. It got me convinced that no one was paying attention to it much. That I was needed to save the world. Like some superhero. It was my purpose. The feeling only lasted a day.
If I made my career choices according to passion it would be a disaster. Hoping from one passion train to the other. Going nowhere. Whatever you do you will have hard days. Tasks which you don&#x27;t like. Days where it is not fun but a slog. How do you push through when the reason you started on that trajectory is something as &#x27;fickle&#x27; as passion?
For the longest time, I had value addition as the answer. Trying to surround myself with the right people and the right environment. With a combination of pride, you get from getting good at something. You get freedom and rewards proportional to the value you give society.
And it still is true. But &#x27;Passion&#x27; always wins on the branding. It is one word. Evokes strong emotion. It gets the lizard brain going. Only recently I found a word that can tickle my lizard brain the same way and sits well with my personal experience - &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27;.
Sam Altman put it wonderfully. He believes it is his &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27; to bring forth a techno-utopia. And all his choices come from it. It is a powerful thing to have. Your own &#x27;Moral Imperative&#x27;. Something you feel is your moral obligation to do on this earth. It is sturdy and powerful. Something that guides the choices you make.
I am trying to define my moral imperative. I believe you should too.</span>

                              <span>A gold Volkswagen Jetta with no seatbelts picks us up from the airport. Our driver talks to Mom in thick accent, slurring syllables together in bunches. There are many words I can’t catch, but the lilting rhythm falls comfortably on my ears.
I grip the door tightly as empty fields and abandoned skyscrapers fly by my window at 150 kilometers an hour. The gray sky is so choked with smog I can look right at the sun, and breathing in the air makes me wince.
Fourteen long years have passed since I was last here. As I take in the vast emptiness unfolding around me on the car ride, I think about just how much has changed. The decade and a half away has put an eternity of distance between me and this place Mom calls home. It feels insurmountable now.

                              <span>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating it—that&#x27;s how I keep the curious-me happy!
However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did try—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.
But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novels—The Sun is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon, and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman—and I enjoyed them!
This got me thinking—what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?
I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:
No slow burns for me—I need the plot to keep moving!
Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I&#x27;d rather delve into a character&#x27;s life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.
I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand words—that&#x27;s what I prefer.
Book length doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweet—ten pages tops.
Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.
So, these are my current reading preferences, though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll evolve as I read more.
For now, I&#x27;m sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll venture out of my comfort zone soon.
Right now, I&#x27;m reading Anxious People—another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It&#x27;s packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I&#x27;ve breezed through about ten chapters and I&#x27;m already in love with it! 🫶</span>

                              <span>A running list of things that have had a big impact on me :
Hank and John Green: Nerdfighteria is my internet home.
WaitButWhy: Deep dives into topics from first principles and cool sticky figures. Became very popular. I was one of the early ones reading the blog. Back when Tim tried to do new posts every Tuesday. Good times. Learned a lot. One of my all time favourite blogs.
Brandon Sanderson: My favourite author. Amazing fictional worlds with detailed world building. His writing literally saved me in a dark period of my life.
Staring into the singularity : The link to this was suprisingly hard to find. The orignal one taken down. I read this a long time ago. When I was around 16. Has stuck with me since.
LessWrong: Great site with awesome posts. Was about rationality back in the day. Has evolved a lot over the years. Lot of gems.
Richard Feynman&#x27;s Lecture On Computation: I keep coming back to this. This man is an absolute legend. Do checkout his lectures on physics as well. His books. Everything actually.</span>

                              <span>The plane I’m taking to China is appallingly shabby, especially after Tokyo’s sleek futurism. It’s a fitting liminal space for the transition: while I’ll miss Tokyo, I’m looking forward to not being the least put-together person on the streets. Going from understanding none of what I see and hear to about half is another plus, I suppose. (Though Tokyo has a LOT more English than where I’m going.) Still, it’ll be nice to respond to questions in the same language they’re asked without too much thought.
Seeing other tourists in Tokyo made me feel a small rush of relief, kinship. I’m not the only one lost here! Except it took me seeing a few of them to realize that when they see me, they probably don’t think the same. Fashion choices and occasional blank stare aside, I look like just another J…</span>

It may not be out of place here to point out that anti‑states are well known in the modern world, above all in what the U.S. Federal Reserve Board classifies as eleven offshore banking centers. Five such enclaves are in the Caribbean: Panama, the Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the British West Indies (Cayman Islands). Three enclaves—Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore—were founded to conduct the China trade. The remaining three are Liberia, Lebanon, and Bahrain at the mouth of the Persian Gulf—the island which Bronze Age Sumerians called Dilmun when they used it to trade with the Indus valley and the Iranian shore.

                              <span>The UAW is on a roll. After winning stupendous contracts at the Big Three automakers this past year, the union then organized Volkswagen in Tennessee April 20. What’s eye-popping about this is that the UAW succeeded not only in the South, but also with a foreign car manufacturer – a twofer. Now as the union zooms in on a May vote by 5000 workers at Mercedes in Alabama, the larger implications of Shawn Fain’s still relatively new union presidency have become clear, namely, a change in workers’ culture in the anti-union, right-to-work South; because if the UAW racks up more wins in the region, that will alter the local political ecosystem. Politicos will find themselves in an environment that includes a growing union presence, something they have sought to extirpate for generations. More

                              <span>It’s difficult to imagine an Israeli war in the Middle East that allowed any Arab country to claim victory.  The history of the Middle East over the past 75 years has been a history of war, and the Israelis have been the overwhelming victor in each and every one of them.  Israel’s War of Independence in 1948 marked an overwhelming victory for the Israelis; it created the profound antagonisms that have marked Israeli relations with the Arab states over the past 75 years.  The United States and Israel over the years have indulged in a dialogue about a “peace process,” but Arab refugees have known neither “peace” nor “process.” More

                              <span>Israel’s disregard for the negotiations and the level of its violence can be measured based on two political realities. It does not take negotiations with the Palestinians seriously and it feels that it can bomb with impunity. This is so because, firstly, Israel is backed fully by the Global North states (mainly the United States and Europe) and secondly, it does not regard Palestinian political views as vital because it has succeeded in breaking the political unity amongst Palestinians and it has succeeded in politically disorienting the various factions by the arrest of their main leadership.

                              <span>bears and cats seem to be the only animals other than humans that are able to appreciate a good view. i saw video the other day of a bear digging himself a hole and sitting in it, onlooking a lake somewhere in the banff region. the video reminds me of the times i&#x27;d go to montenegro with my family, id dig pockets into the sand to rest my knees and stomach before laying a towel down and going to sleep. similarly, i often find my cats sitting on their cat towers outlooking the view of the lake from my balcony. genuinely good living. i always get thrown back at idea of humans getting considering as the solely &quot;intelligent&quot; animals. most of us can&#x27;t sit for a few moments and enjoy a good view, meanwhile cat and bears do it all the time. in what world does that make sense?

anyways, i&#x27;ve become a bit more lax with blogging and such. it&#x27;s been a bit of a secondary function these past few months. i get the itch at times to do small things, like write a post, or read, or research or code something. at other times, i get even worse itchings to do more drastic things, move away, quit my job, or delete every trace of myself on the internet and live like a hermit. i get annoyed quite honestly, theres always something to do or something i would like to do, and all these options cause me to paralyze myself. i find myself walking a lot these days. spending most days out of the house, which helps. a little coffee and a walk in nature helps me soothe myself. i feel like the bear in the video. a bit of a hopelessly lost almost-22 year old bear. i think time will probably tell how this all goes.</span>

SIG Network is pleased to announce the v1.1 release of
Gateway API. In this release, several features are graduating to
Standard Channel (GA), notably including support for service mesh and
GRPCRoute. We&#x27;re also introducing some new experimental features, including
session persistence and client certificate verification.

Graduation to Standard
This release includes the graduation to Standard of four eagerly awaited features.
This means they are no longer experimental concepts; inclusion in the Standard
release channel denotes a high level of confidence in the API surface and
provides guarantees of backward compatibility. Of course, as with any other
Kubernetes API, Standard Channel features can continue to evolve w…</span>

                              <span>One of the most striking features of the labor market recovery following the pandemic recession has been the surge in quits from 2021 to mid-2023. This surge, often referred to as the Great Resignation, or the Great Reshuffle, was uncommonly large for an economic expansion. In this post, we call attention to a related labor market change that has not been previously highlighted—a persistent change in retirement expectations, with workers reporting much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67. This decline is particularly notable for female workers and lower-income workers.</span>

                              <span>In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It&#x27;s not poetic; it&#x27;s real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here&#x27;s the truth about living as a paradox:
I&#x27;m drawn to happiness, sure, but I can&#x27;t shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I&#x27;m stuck in the middle.
I&#x27;m not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there&#x27;s a begrudging respect for the person I&#x27;ve become, scars and all.
When I say &quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It&#x27;s just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.
Attention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I&#x27;m just not used to being seen.
I&#x27;ve been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I&#x27;ve tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.
Listening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m great at keeping other people&#x27;s secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I&#x27;d rather keep them locked away.
So yeah, I&#x27;m a walking contradiction. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s confusing, but it&#x27;s real. And maybe that&#x27;s okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life&#x27;s contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.</span>

                              <span>I thought I’d take it easy this trip to Tokyo since I didn’t plan at all. Two days in, I’ve logged 22 miles, 56,000 steps on concrete in barefoot shoes. It’s okay, though—my overworked feet will have time to recover in China. The sheer amount of walking I’ve done is testament both to how pedestrian friendly Tokyo is and to the way I still try to minmax my travels at the expense of my physical and mental health. Old habits die hard.
I wrote a while back about how one of my favorite things about traveling is getting to microdose on cluelessness. These past few days in Japan have taught me that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. The last time I was in a place where I didn’t speak the local language was seven years ago (France and Italy), and there I could at least read, if not u…</span>

                              <span>The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?</span>

                              <span>Today marks my first completed year of writing on Bear. I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I&#x27;ve gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I&#x27;ve stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.
When I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I&#x27;m not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert. Honestly, if a person had a spiritual exploration in the desert for 40 days, …</span>

                              <span>More than four years have passed since the onset of the pandemic, which resulted in one of the sharpest and deepest economic downturns in U.S. history. While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not.
