He searched for the names of Biden and Trump, equally, it seemed and was likely to have pulled the trigger on the first one who entered the sights of his AR-15. There was just a dime’s worth of difference between them as far as he was concerned. Crooks is the next variation on Kyle Rittenhouse, a fucked up white kid, working a dead-end job in a shabbily run nursing home, who ventured forth bound for glory with a semi-automatic rifle in the Republic of the Shooter.

                              <span>u know that feeling when u it&#x27;s nearly impossible to achieve something..
either because you&#x27;re too late
or you didn&#x27;t prepare enough and it has high competition
your mind and logic says: there is no way
but your brain (or soul?) says: f*ck it we do it anyway.
and somehow (most of the time) it works out!
and even if it doesn&#x27;t -- u don&#x27;t feel thaaat bad..
u say gg and move on.
that leap of faith is real!
i hope such happy ending occurs again in my upcoming move inshallah.
if u reading this: wish me luck homie -- will need it fr.</span>

                              <span>this is the first time i&#x27;m revealing my age on bear, something i kept hidden for privacy&#x27;s sake. 

i&#x27;m quitting my part-time job next week. 

is it okay to be unemployed at 26? 

i think it&#x27;s mainly because i don&#x27;t like where i am right now. 

when i was a kid i picked up on things very quickly. 

i know (i hope) i won&#x27;t be stuck here forever. 

i&#x27;m still struggling, and even if i tell myself and others that there is no such thing as being behind, i can&#x27;t help but feel dissatisfied with my current situation. 

i&#x27;m trying to have faith in myself but i&#x27;m not so good on my own, so please put your faith in me as well. 
and hope with me that this too shall pass.</span>

-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don&#x27;t read them. I&#x27;m a collector of nightstand-books.
-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I&#x27;m in love.
-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.
-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you&#x27;re shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you&#x27;re wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.
-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).
-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don&#x27;t know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.</span>

Even if they are small things, I want to learn basics again other than simply editing templates or static site generators. I&#x27;ll keep my main blog for everything else I want to share, but I had to buy-yet-another-domain as a nudge to see if I can seperate this tech space online. I also hope to actually put it on a resume one day.
I want to focus on fun projects that I might use, such as learning how to create a discord bot, a Twitch bot or overlay, or other tools that I&#x27;ll use for my current hobbies. I think a to do list of sorts that I come back to now and again is a good start.

                              <span>I liked Bell Labs ever since 1986 or 1987 or so. I was considering developing a C++ compiler, but was concerned about:
1. would I need a license to develop a C++ compiler?
2. would I need a license to call it C++?
So I called up their head intellectual property lawyer. He laughed, and said feel free, and thanked me for asking. He said other people just went ahead and copied things hoping BL wouldn&#x27;t notice.
So thank you, Bell Labs! You guys were the best.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes I feel really bummed out I am getting 1/2 (or less?) of Google compensation. But then I open my eyes - see the workers in my daughter&#x27;s kindergarten slaving away taking care of 30 toddlers for less than half what I make, nurses and doctors working in conditions I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tolerate for more than a few months without mentally collapsing, the people in the supermarkets, gas stations, police, fire departments, social workers, teachers etc etc.
Really I don&#x27;t see what we have to complain about - whether its a 3 man startup with &quot;low&quot; compensation or anything else. 
You&#x27;re getting paid for solving code riddles the whole day.  You&#x27;re getting paid a lot. Quit comparing yourself to your friends that work in Google and try to learn how to cultivate a peaceful and happy mind.</span>

                              <span>For Nvidia, the most likely reason they&#x27;ve strongly avoided Open Sourcing their drivers isn&#x27;t anything like that.
It&#x27;s simply a function of their history. They used to have high priced professional level graphics cards (&quot;Nvidia Quadro&quot;) using exactly the same chips as their consumer graphics cards.
The BIOS of the cards was different, enabling different features. So people wanting those features cheaply would buy the consumer graphics cards and flash the matching Quadro BIOS to them. Worked perfectly fine.
Nvidia naturally wasn&#x27;t happy about those &quot;lost sales&quot;, so began a game of whack-a-mole to stop BIOS flashing from working. They did stuff like adding resistors to the boards to tell the card whether it was a Geforce or Quadro card, and when that was promptly reverse engineered they started getting creative in other ways.
Meanwhile, they couldn&#x27;t really Open Source their drivers because then people could see what the &quot;Geforce vs Quadro&quot; software checks were. That would open up software countermeasures being developed.
---
In the most recent few years the professional cards and gaming cards now use different chips. So the BIOS tricks are no longer relevant.
Which means Nvidia can &quot;safely&quot; Open Source their drivers now, and they&#x27;ve begun doing so.

That, I never get called for these interviews because I don&#x27;t use react angles or something, but if they did, I&#x27;d crush the interview and fall asleep at my desk once they start giving me work.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Most jobs are now hoops after hoops, not taking into consideration your particular profile or the contributions you can make.
This is really key. I have applied for jobs before, and then get questions like: &quot;what&#x27;s your experience with C++ or advanced graph algorithms?&quot;. Only that, none of that shows up in my profile or resume. But they act surprised and completely shrug off how a decade of software and other relevant experience is suddenly invalidated. As in, a person who has used and learned a dozen plus languages but only tacitly used C++ suddenly will be a complete invalid when trying to write in C++? Another company advertised that Python experience wasn&#x27;t needed, but then the first phone interview peppered me with low-level Python implementation questions. Why even bother to interview me? It&#x27;s a waste of everyone&#x27;s time.
What it boils down to is that companies have zero idea how to hire. And they have zero idea how to mentor and train, basically for the exact same reasons for why they don&#x27;t know how to hire.
While tough, it&#x27;s often a good thing for the applicant as a natural filter. If someone can&#x27;t hire well, it&#x27;s not a good place to work. Sometimes it is, but it&#x27;s relatively rare.</span>

                              <span>I unapologetically love this thing. It&#x27;s of course very silly, and I&#x27;m sure commenters here are going to talk about all the ways that it isn&#x27;t practical or that it&#x27;s a niche idea, but I love whimsical silly niche hardware ideas that make it into actual hardware. I love that they put in all of the effort to figure out a mechanical linkage between the clickwheel and the digital crown!
I don&#x27;t think all hardware needs to be take-over-the-world hundred-million-unit ideas; I think sometimes it&#x27;s fine for hardware to be whimsical niche things like this Apple Watch case or Andrew McCalip&#x27;s doomscroller doo-dad [1]!

Asking basic questions that will be directly applicable to the job?  Sure
Filtering for basic knowledge to make sure the candidate isn&#x27;t lying about their experience?  Sure.
Examining my thought process and producing working code is a nice-to-have?  Sure.
Asking me to solve an extremely esoteric problem that has zero relevance to my day-to-day and if the solution I come up with on the spot under time pressure is incorrect or even just not the most efficient I&#x27;m rejected?

                              <span>&gt;According to all the interviews I’ve failed over the years (I don’t think I’ve ever passed an actual “coding interview” anywhere?), the entire goal of tech hiring is just finding people in the 100 to 115 midwit block then outright rejecting everybody else as too much of an unknown risk.
As a (now) senior/staff-level engineer back out on the job market for the first time in a while, I&#x27;m begrudgingly coming to accept that coding interviews might not actually be all that bad. Mostly because I find myself passing them due to having picked up skills in the past few years rather than spending a ton of time studying, which suggests they might actually be picking up some signal. I once thought they were purely hazing with zero relevance to day to day work, but as I get more senior I drift further away from that opinion.</span>

                              <span>I generally like the article but the author seems to have a really inflated view of what jobs are paying. At one point he’s claiming that a stable non tech company like a tractor manufacturer is paying 5k-10k.
Even assuming that’s including taxes so divide by two, and constraining to just software employees for that claim. There is no way the average pay is nearly a million a year. The average software engineer in the US is making around 135-150k a year and that average is including all the faang engineers with the top end salary</span>

                              <span>I will add my two cents for people who believe that this might be related only to the SWE and tangent industries: It&#x27;s really not. I have many friends (in Europe) who are trying to get through to different jobs in unrelated industries ranging from finance to fashion, or just trying to get promoted vertically (or horizontally), failing rather miserably.
Most jobs are now hoops after hoops, not taking into consideration your particular profile or the contributions you can make. Keep in mind also that a CV in the pile via a job portal is always going to be sediment at the bottom of the barrel. Try to make use of your networks and friends as much as possible.
As for my situation, I too feel a bit burned by the diminishing number of tech jobs, as I was in the process of trying to get a job via a software consultancy firm, but remained benched for 8 months. I dropped it, went back to doing corporate and tax valuations. Being underemployed is, thus far, better than nothing at all, especially mentally.
P.S. Here&#x27;s a nice little tidbit in the source:

                              <span>I was a late bloomer in almost every arena of my life. Developing social skills, having relationships, developing an identity independent of my family, etc. I&#x27;m also a late bloomer to mathematics.
I&#x27;m in my 30s and getting a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Math now after a lifetime of math-phobia. Math was my worst subject because it never came easily or naturally to me, and so I assumed I must have been innately incapable of it. I didn&#x27;t take a single math class during my first bachelor&#x27;s degree.
I sure wish I could have learned math properly earlier in life, but my point with this comment is that it is never too late to learn math.
Learning mathematics &quot;late&quot; over the last couple of years has enriched my life in so many ways. Learning to write proofs has brought a sense of organization and calm to many other areas of my life. Complex problems and challenges in life feel so much more approachable, because I am much more skilled now in breaking down tasks to manageable components. I can see now how mathematics has influenced programming languages and computer science, and every time I can identify the mathematical underpinning of some program I  use or write, I feel like I am peering into the heart of the universe.
Learning math early is a great hack, but so is learning math late :)</span>

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;m the engineer who implemented the new feature. Just clearing up some confusion.
A lot of you are noticing the preexisting automatic detection feature from 2022 [1], which I also worked on. That&#x27;s NOT what this newly announced feature is. The new feature supports full import/export, but it&#x27;s still rolling out so you&#x27;re likely not seeing it yet!
Hope you like it once it reaches you :)

                              <span>One of the things I’m trying to make a habit of is posting more frequently (or often) in my photoblog page. My posts have always been slightly sporadic, and definitely not consistent since I started that site (last year). Maybe it’s because I have a problem.
When I go on photowalks, or a full day of shooting, I accumulate a lot of photos from that day. I upload all my photos to my external SSD. My folder hierarchy for photos is typically:
Year &gt; Photos &gt; Camera &gt; Month &gt; Folder Name with date
So in some instances that would look something like:
2004 &gt; Photos &gt; X100V &gt; 07 July &gt; 071724 aWalkInSF
(Yes, I am a supporter of camelCase instead of snake_case)
Anyways… my photos are not tagged, and keep their original names. If a particular photo is edited, the original is DSCF3415, and the edited…</span>

                              <span>In my last post I didn&#x27;t finish writing everything I wanted to say before hitting Publish. My posts often get broken up like this in my desire to publish fast and often; when I find a nice place to stop, I put a bow on my draft and send it out, lest I dawdle too long and kill my momentum.
That said, this post will be a continuation of sorts. Here are the rest of the thoughts inspired by Misha&#x27;s post.
it feels like people are moving forward with their lives, but i’m still stuck at the same place i was when i was when i was 18, choosing a college degree that will change the trajectory of my life.
i had bigger dreams as a teenager. i wanted to do things—get out more; live a little differently than how my 15 year old self did. instead, i became the type of person who waits for her paycheck twi…</span>

                              <span>Hi Misha!
I&#x27;ve read your post a life lived diligently, and it made me want to write to you.
When I was younger, I dreamed every day of becoming a product designer. I had convinced myself I was going to go study abroad, become self-employed, and the riches and fame would be mine.
poor, depressed artist aesthetic, after which I would be discovered and prove everyone wrong about not chasing your dreams. My peers would see me on TV and gawk. Grand finale: let the curtain fall; everyone applauds.
I&#x27;m happy to say none of that came true.
The truth is, your 20s are a little bit of a bitch. These are the years someone can either be going steady with a child on each hip or they can be partying &#x27;til the sun goes down. Comparison is hard to keep at bay since everyone is going at a different pace and …</span>

                              <span>Contrary to what the name may suggest, this is not a blog dedicated solely to my problems. As I make my debut into the realm of Bear — thrilled at the thought of reaching other bloggers through the ever-inspiring discovery feed — I must make one thing clear: I love a good rhyme. Sometimes more than logic. And in this case, the tradeoff for choosing a name that rhymes is that the content in my blog won’t always align with the title, and I’m okay with that.
My purpose here isn’t to please or to delight; it’s to express — something we rarely get the space to do authentically online. Being here takes a degree of vulnerability for me, but it comes with the gentle comfort of some anonymity.
Here, I am still Emma as I am in everyday life, but I am also imperceptible behind the words you read. While I plan to share with an open heart and freely exhibit the more anomalous corners of my mind, I know that the stakes are lower than what they seem to be on other platforms, where it often feels like I&#x27;m being observed too closely, or slipping into an alter-ego that doesn&#x27;t truly capture me. Here, it feels like I can say what I want to say without the recurring fear of being perceived or held to a fixed identity. And, no matter who happens to stumble upon the musings of these pages — no matter who thinks what of the words I write — I still intend to make this a space where I can comfortably express whatever may come to the surface of my being.
And so, with a nod of thanks to you, the equally imperceptible reader, and also one to the creator of this charming platform — who happens to be the man I gladly spend my days with — so begins my emergence. Let’s see what this Bear blogness is all about.</span>

                              <span>Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.</span>

Introduction
TO BEGIN...
 “We recognize that the feminist camp has made great efforts, by revealing the mechanisms that oppress women and dissidence, and by naming issues that used to be invisible. However, this does not mean that the concepts and categories, and therefore the theoretical frameworks, are all equally valid. As especifist anarchists we task ourselves with taking from these theoretical productions, the concepts and categories that are consistent with our own ideology. Referring to the guiding principles of other currents will not only lead us down a different ideological path but also have concrete effects on the militancy, on the political level as on the …</span>

 It was Autumn. A carriage and a calesche were proceeding at a sharp trot along the high-road. In the carriage sat two women. One of them was the mistress, thin and pale. The other was the maid, smug, florid, and buxom. Her short dry tresses peeped forth from under her faded bonnet, her pretty hand in her torn glove readjusted them from time to time; her swelling bosom, covered by a rug, was full of the breath of health; her quick black eyes glanced at one moment out of the window at the scurrying fields, at another stared boldly at her mistress, or glanced uneasily at the corners of the carriage.

                              <span>I believe a great product in this area is certainly possible and Karpathy probably has the technical chops to create it.
I&#x27;m skeptical that the product described in the announcement will result in a business able to generate VC-level returns. Based on my experience as a tech entrepreneur with edu-focused products across multiple startups and decades, scaling sales revenue to significant levels in edu is extremely challenging for unique and non-obvious reasons. None of the edu-specific challenges are directly related to the effectiveness or relative value of the product itself. They are structural problems related to the three main types of buyers, which are: 1. Schools, (K-12, Univ), 2. Companies (employee training, compliance, etc), 3. Individuals (self-learners). There are other types of…</span>

                              <span>My personal experience with story points is that the number never really mattered, but the process of the team discussing how to rate the complexity of a task was very useful. In terms of having utility of estimating how long something will take, I personally have never been able to translate story points into a reliable indicator for that for many reasons (e.g team changing, domain changing, variability in operational load outside of development work).
Overall I tend to avoid using story points, but on the few teams I worked on who really wanted to use it, I always framed it around building shared understanding rather than a metric that is actually useful for estimating work.</span>

                              <span>I think teaching is one of the few roles that can&#x27;t be replaced by AI. If you&#x27;re a self-motivated learner, eager to gain new skills, then AI is perfect for you. Having a virtual Feynman coach you through a Physics course is perfect.
Most learners, the world over, are not self-motivated. The pandemic showed us exactly what children would prefer to do, when they don&#x27;t have a physical teacher standing over them, which is bugger all. We send kids to school, in the hope they get some education, but the reality is that we use schools for free childcare while we work. If parents have to additionally monitor their child&#x27;s learning, it breaks down pretty quickly.
I see AI being more of a teaching assistant, rather than a replacement for teachers. Having been in the education game for over twenty five years, I know the difference in impact when comparing virtual learning to in-person training.</span>

What isn’t clear, in retrospect or otherwise, is why companies/apps/services need to keep learning this lesson. The user outcry was utterly predictable from even before the first web article was out. The fact that no one with decision power at Mozilla saw it coming is worrying: either they have zero understanding of people’s concerns for privacy or they don’t care. Neither is good.</span>

 Most of what comes out in the text “Addicted to Losing” is not new. Black anarchists and anti-authoritarians have been critiquing black non-profits, Black academics, Black activists and black authoritarians for years before the 2020 uprising. Black anarchists who have been active PRIOR to 2020 have been deeply aware of these critiques, mainly based on their experiences. We are unsure how connected the author is to Black anti-authoritarians but, best believe Black anarchists been having these conversations. There has been so much ta…</span>

Subtitle: rejecting the state in the status quo — examples of an Anarchist approach

 For most of the 20th century, all mainstream political parties in Western Europe coalesced around the idea that, ultimately, the state should be the chief provider of social welfare and instrument of social reform. Although Feminist, Anti-Racist, Neo-Marxist, Green and other left-leaning critiques were put forward, particularly in the 1970s,[1] criticism of the welfare state has come predominantly from the free-market right. This has culminated in attacks on the direct provision of welfare by the state in…</span>

Tire fire barricade at the AirBnBs!
 Throw a molotov at the PowerPoint Presentations! Dump a smelly bucket of shrimp on the peaceful protest! We’re going to Stop Block Cop City!! 
 Why? 
 Because I’m mad that they wasted my time with their awful presentation/book-report/thinly-veiled-business-management-double-speak that tried to sell me and a bunch of other anarchists a program of non-violent civil disobedience to stop the police training facility from being constructed in the Old Prison Farm. 
I had to sit through:

___________

Yesterday, when I woke up to go for work. I always take a shower &amp; change cloths.
I was half sleep ironing my pant &amp; shirt while yawning . Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.
The bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)

Then I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .
My half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.
My grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?
I told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.
I cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).
I was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.
I felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth. I even shudder just thinking about this event.

                              <span>I had planned to write a post about which text editor I use and why. Another idea was to write about why my next phone might be a Pixel instead of an iPhone. But it feels so incredibly boring to write about.
I don&#x27;t know what it is, but lately these things feel completely pointless to write about. I&#x27;m a tech geek, so it&#x27;s natural for these ideas to come up, but writing serves a different purpose. At least for me.
Am I saying that writing about technology is &quot;bad&quot;? No, of course not. I read blogs like MacRumors and 9to5Google every day with great interest (I used to run similar blogs myself). But that&#x27;s not what I want to write about, at least not right now.
Now I like writing mainly for the therapeutic, almost meditative effect it has on me. I write every day, and I find it very rewarding on a personal level.
These thoughts also lead me to a topic I&#x27;ve been writing about several times now: my ambivalence toward writing in English. I&#x27;m writing this text in Swedish because it&#x27;s too hard and time-consuming to do it in English (I&#x27;ve tried many times) and then using DeepL to translate it.
Why bother with all of that? Well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m asking myself.
If I&#x27;m writing mainly for personal gain, why not just in Swedish? The only thing I can think of is because of the increased attention, which honestly feels like an idiotic argument.
Ok, this was not a text I had planned. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t even post it, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.
These are my thoughts here and now, unedited.</span>

                              <span>This post is inspired by Misha’s post a life lived diligently.
I started playing the piano when I was five. My first dream was to be a concert pianist like Lang Lang. I was drawn to the glitz and glamor of playing in cavernous concert halls to people in suits sitting on red velvet chairs. I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.
For a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around. I thought it a nice compromise between my childhood fantasies and reality.

                              <span>The consumer price index for groceries has risen more than the overall price index since the start of the pandemic, with a particularly large jump in 2022. In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.</span>

Title: What is the Proletariat?
Date: 2024/05/10
Source: Retrieved on 2024-07-16 from 

 In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Manifesto of the Communist Party. It famously ends by declaring, “let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. Proletarians have nothing to lose in it but their chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries unite!” (Marx and Engels 1996, 30). The word proletariat continues to be used by socialists and communists today. This does not mean that the word is widely understood. Some people use it as a meaningless adjective whereby their ideas, attitudes, and activities are proletarian. Those of people they dislike are bourgeois. Others equate the proletaria…</span>

1. THE NORTH BOTHNIA LINE
Why aiming at this beast?
 This is a call to action against the North Bothnia Line, a railway just beginning to be built along the coast of Swedish-occupied Sápmi. This project is a continuation of several hundred years of brutal colonization of the peoples and lands in Sápmi. Extractive industries are thriving on the increased demand for raw materials following the so-called “green transition”. This makes them continually stress the importance and urgency of the train line. So do the Swedish State and the European Union.

 Operation ‘Scripta Manent’ is one repressive operation among the many that have already occurred, and continue to occur, against comrades who dare to oppose the Italian State.

Abstract:
 The article presents a first overview of the emergence and early development of anarchism in the Republic of Cyprus, utilising archival material. It contextualises Cypriot anarchism within the broader wave of political ideas making their appearance after the island’s de-facto partition in 1974, tracing the formation of the first anarchist groups and the circulation of early Cypriot anarchist publications. It moves on to briefly discuss three key historical moments of anarchist political expression, followed by an examination of early Cypri…</span>

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursive signifiers, through which the mediation of a fixed meaning is structured and social reality is experienced. This research…</span>

                              <span>I worked at a PBM back in the late-90s/early-2000s. It was where I was introduced to the value of customer data and the strange world of lawyers, all in a single corporate meeting:
- The company is launching a new service. We already sell customer drug-prescription data to drug companies, and the drug companies analyze this data to understand where/when/why/to-whom their drugs are being prescribed. Now we&#x27;re going to help the drug companies advise doctors on where/when/why/to-whom they prescribe drugs.
- Sounds great. Where do we come in?
- The new service will act as a middleman, processing payments from drug companies to doctors.
- So, a service to manage kickbacks?
[Meeting room full of suits goes silent.]
- The payments aren&#x27;t &quot;kickbacks&quot;. They&#x27;re &quot;rebates&quot;.
- Is there a difference?
- Absolutely. [silence]
- So...what&#x27;s the difference?
- Please be sure to only use the term &quot;rebate&quot; in all communications, especially email. Never use the term &quot;kickback&quot;.
And that was pretty much it. The company processed prescriptions for pharmacies, then sold that data to drug companies, who in turn used that data to provide kickbacks to doctors for pushing their drugs over a competitor. And it was all legal, thanks to the lawyers and their select word usage. Oh, and I think we weren&#x27;t supposed to use the term &quot;middleman&quot;, either.</span>

                              <span>A lot of people think AMD should support these translation layers but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea. CUDA is not designed to be vendor agnostic and Nvidia can make things arbitrarily difficult both technically and legally. For example I think it would be against the license agreement of cuDNN or cuBLAS to run them on this. So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.
Chasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool&#x27;s errand. The important users of CUDA are open source. AMD can implement support directly in the upstream projects like pytorch or llama.cpp. And once support is there it can be maintained by the community.</span>

                              <span>I consider myself a pretty fast reader. I typically get through a book way before it needs to be returned back on Libby1. I get 21 days to finish a book (although my friends have reported 14 days), and that is usually plenty of time. With that said, I’ve never stressed about finishing a book in time.
Until now.
It’s taking me forever to finish A Court of Silver Flames by Sarah J. Maas. It’s not that it’s a terrible book but I haven’t been finding enough energy to read lately. I even switched to listening on Spotify Premium, and I’m still not done.
Anyways.
The return due date has come and gone, but I’m still not done with the book. For those who are familiar with the ACOTAR series, it’s pretty popular right now so the wait time is pretty long. I was on hold for several months for each book…</span>

 These are times when it seems there are big discussions about the issue of cities, urban areas, about the possibilities of revolt inside them (even of living), of their reformability. Big discussions frequently focused on various topics relating to struggles carried out by many opponents, antagonists, often reformists, sometimes even by enemies of every order and authority; among these issues there is gentrification, a word not so unusual anymore, a word we now want to express some thoughts about.

We Are not Spectators but Enemies of all Forms of Dominion
 Today we wanted to give vent to a small anarchist impulse by brandishing the weapons of life and the ideas of rebellion. 
 As we are convinced that the status quo is being maintained not only by those who hold power but also by the servile attitude of those who tacitly support it, toady we decided to attack polling station 98a in the town of La Reina with an explosive/incendiary device.

 One time, maybe ten years back, I was on the DC metro with my family. My brother and I were happily talking about the feminist implications of GI Joe, because my brother is cool as hell, when a stranger looked over at my father (not knowing we were related) to complain about how I spoke. 
 “They really don’t teach people how to speak English anymore,” the stranger complained. 
 I’m not the world’s fighty-est person, but I’ve also never been the world’s least fighty person, so I confronted him immediately. “Oh?!” I asked. “What’s wrong with the way we’re talking?!”

 There’s not much to be said about an episode of repression, after all it’s the simple cyclical occurrence of action and reaction – or even on how repression plays dirty – another well-known fact. At most these are just a few notes on the development of techniques and strategies. 
 This I’ll try to do.

Source: . Retrieved on 03/07/2024 from lib.anarhija.net.

On the 27th of April, Christos Tsakalos, for the case of C.C.F. with the upgraded charge of the managerial executive, was transported to the prisons of Koridallos, after a call for appearance at the juridical council, where he denies to appear.
 Today therefore, Wednesday the 27th of April, I announce officially to the juridical authorities, to not “bother me again” with their repeated calls for my presence in the interrogative process, because they will receive my total refusal and my factual contempt. 
 There is not even a millimeter of dialogue to be shared with my judges.

Notes: We created this zine to hand out alongside ice packs and gatorade as a deadly heatwave swept accross our region. At time of posting, that heatwave is continuing east across North America, and more will certainly follow in the coming months and years as the climate crisis worsens. While this zine contains a couple sentences specific to so-called Boulder Colorado, it should still be broadly applicable, and we encourage people to print and distribute it anywhere that’s affected by extreme heat. We note that the advice contained within is not particularly useful without the supplies needed to follow it, and we recommend accompanying this zine with water, electrolyte powder…</span>

 148 years ago this week, on April 6, 1871, armed participants in the revolutionary Paris Commune seized the guillotine that was stored near the prison in Paris. They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians. At the time, the Commune controlled Paris, which was st…</span>

 The purpose of this piece is to better understanding of mass media’s relationship to rebels (including anarchists of all stripes), in general as well as in the context of a repressive atmosphere in Bristol. As well as raising local specifics, it hopes to encourage stronger awareness around wider issues of representation and counter-insurgency. 
 It will speak critically, even harshly when deemed necessary, of some self-professed radicals’ interactions with the establishment – but not out of an impulse for character-assassination. Contrary t…</span>

Alright, I know they are not bad activities at all and they might be one of the ways to enrich our inner selves. But traveling is neither holy nor sacred.
In my 20s, I loved exploring new places. I hitchhiked around Eastern Europe, rode my touring bicycle along the coast in western Türkiye and went on numerous camping trips. Back then, these activities gave me a sense of freedom and the joy of meeting interesting people. Nowadays, these activities no longer bring me the same enjoyment.

                              <span>spotify is legal piracy. you can listen to most of your music by just paying a small amount and most of that doesn&#x27;t go to the artist. hell with the rise of AI, enshittification got to a level that it never has before. I just don&#x27;t want to be a part of that anymore.
there is also another reason I&#x27;m doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.

how I manage it
I download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn&#x27;t get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.
I use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.
notes
you can also take a look at kit&#x27;s post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.
