Indeed, the cops have been the only real outside agitators on campuses across the country this Spring. They have brought upheaval and disorder by breaking up peaceful protests by disciplined students with a cause and ideals. And, of course, the administrators are responsible for calling in the cops. It’s the administrators who up the ante and invite confrontations and clashes. Blaming outsiders for rebellions and revolutions is one of the oldest and nastiest ruses in the world. And one of the newest, too. But it’s not working. More

Eyes glazing over with the unmistakable shroud of death. This is Rafah. This is what is happening now. And yet, I keep seeing people say they feel “unsafe” because of the mere existence of encampments on university campuses. Feeling unsafe because others are protesting a genocide. And I think about what it actually means to be unsafe. Is there anything more unsafe than being displaced, starved, endlessly bombed, shot at, or buried alive? More

                              <span>In the jumble of thoughts and emotions that make up my existence, I find myself entangled in a web of contradictions. It&#x27;s not poetic; it&#x27;s real, raw, and sometimes messy. Here&#x27;s the truth about living as a paradox:
I&#x27;m drawn to happiness, sure, but I can&#x27;t shake off the weight of sad thoughts that often cloud my mind. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a constant tug-of-war between the two, and I&#x27;m stuck in the middle.
I&#x27;m not always my biggest fan. I see my flaws and shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. But amidst all that self-doubt, there&#x27;s a begrudging respect for the person I&#x27;ve become, scars and all.
When I say &quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m indifferent. Deep down, I care too much. It&#x27;s just easier to put up walls than to deal with the vulnerability that comes with caring.
Attention is a tricky thing. I crave it, no doubt, but when it comes my way, I often find myself pushing it away. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of what it might reveal about me, or maybe I&#x27;m just not used to being seen.
I&#x27;ve been both a healer and a wounded soul in relationships. I&#x27;ve tried to fix others, thinking it would fix me too, only to end up with my own heart broken in the process.
Listening comes naturally to me, but sharing doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m great at keeping other people&#x27;s secrets, but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I&#x27;d rather keep them locked away.
So yeah, I&#x27;m a walking contradiction. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s confusing, but it&#x27;s real. And maybe that&#x27;s okay. Maybe embracing the messiness of life&#x27;s contradictions is the most honest thing we can do.</span>

                              <span>I thought I’d take it easy this trip to Tokyo since I didn’t plan at all. Two days in, I’ve logged 22 miles, 56,000 steps on concrete in barefoot shoes. It’s okay, though—my overworked feet will have time to recover in China. The sheer amount of walking I’ve done is testament both to how pedestrian friendly Tokyo is and to the way I still try to minmax my travels at the expense of my physical and mental health. Old habits die hard.
I wrote a while back about how one of my favorite things about traveling is getting to microdose on cluelessness. These past few days in Japan have taught me that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. The last time I was in a place where I didn’t speak the local language was seven years ago (France and Italy), and there I could at least read, if not u…</span>

                              <span>The end of the Great Recession marked the beginning of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Great Recession, with its dramatic housing bust, led to a wave of home foreclosures as overleveraged borrowers found themselves unable to meet their payment obligations. In early 2009, the New York Fed’s Research Group launched the Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a foundational data set of the Center for Microeconomic Data, to monitor the financial health of Americans as the economy recovered. The CCP, which is based on anonymized credit report data from Equifax, gives us an opportunity to track individuals during the period leading to the foreclosure, observe when a flag is added to their credit report and then—years later—removed. Here, we examine the longer-term impact of a foreclosure on borrowers’ credit scores and borrowing experiences: do they return to borrowing, or shy away from credit use and homeownership after their earlier bad experience?</span>

This nearly 70% antidepressant effectiveness claim, we’ve been told, is backed by the 2006 Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. More

I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I&#x27;ve gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I&#x27;ve stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.
When I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I&#x27;m not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert. Honestly, if a person had a spiritual exploration in the desert for 40 days, …</span>

While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not. Indeed, job shortfalls remain in more than a quarter of the country’s metro areas, including many in the New York-Northern New Jersey region. In fact, while employment is well above pre-pandemic levels in Northern New Jersey, jobs have only recently recovered in and around New York City, and most of upstate New York—like much of the Rust Belt—still has not fully recovered and has some of the largest job shortfalls in the country.</span>

Later, after many innocents have been murdered, they will claim ignorance about what was going on. More

                              <span>The U.S. housing market has had a tumultuous few years. After falling to record lows during the pandemic, the average 30-year mortgage rate rapidly increased in 2022 and 2023 and now hovers near a two-decade high of 7.2 percent. For those that locked in a low mortgage rate prior to 2022, this steep increase has significantly increased the cost of moving, as taking out a mortgage at current rates would potentially increase their monthly housing payment by hundreds or thousands of dollars, even if the amount they borrowed remained unchanged. As shown by Ferreira et al. (2011), this lock-in effect has the potential to reduce geographic mobility and turnover in the housing market and has gained the attention of  Federal Reserve leaders. In this post, we utilize special questions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys to estimate the extent to which mortgage rate lock-in is suppressing U.S. household’s moving plans.</span>

                              <span>I have played a lot of Wolves Upon the Coast. I love it and recommend this system to anyone that wants the vibes of Iron Age Warriors seeking to make great stories. So if this is what you are looking for is just &quot;is it worth it&quot; I would say Yes. Past that I am going to do a review of my favorite and least favorite bits of this system. I also am going to review Wolves the system before Wolves the setting I will do the setting in the future but for now I wanted to talk about this system.
The Good:

It feels extraordinarily silly to write about that, but I think it matters.
I should&#x27;ve written this yesterday! Whilst feeling the emotions and thinking the thoughts! But alas, I did not.
Part of the reason why I didn’t is the same reason why I’ve never been able to keep a journal, no matter how many of those my mother gifted me when I was a child in an attempt to encourage the habit. (Same goes for a blog, ironically, or at least one that is about myself.)
That reason is that I think in words. Not in the sense of hearing them, not quite in the sense of saying them either, but I think the way I write: the words, sentences, just kind of come to me. I don’t exactly conjure them. But I do almost see them, like you would see a h…</span>

                              <span>hey! i haven&#x27;t posted for a while now. i wanted to talk about more manga but couldn&#x27;t justify making a whole post dedicated to one series. so here is a post where i talk about a couple of them briefly. this one will be less edited and more chaotic than usual so enjoy!
cigarette and cherry

i know i know, the last manga i reviewed also had a smoking theme and was a romance manga. the similarities were actually how i found this one.
it has a simple plot of a student enrolling to a university and trying to find a girlfriend but you slowly get invested in the characters and enjoy their banter. most of the story is centered around a cafe and gives me a sort of friends vibe. i enjoyed my time with it, i think it&#x27;s worth checking out.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been able to watch anything lately like animes, youtube videos, dramas, movies, documentaries etc.
Watching feels just too slow for me. If I read, I can consume the content with my preference of pace. That&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t do with watching. Yes, I can speed up the video most of the time but it is still not enough.
It is not like I read super fast by the way. I&#x27;m a quite average reader in terms of speed. Reading just feels more personal, internalizable and absorbable.
It&#x27;s probably because reading is an active process while watching is a passive process.
The important thing is that I realized this reality within myself and I decided to reduce watching videos. So I&#x27;ve been purposely avoiding watching videos for awhile now. I can say that consuming contents in reading format is much more better.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday during my brother&#x27;s graduation my mom told me that her older brother (my uncle) was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with late stage lung cancer.
I don&#x27;t know exactly when this happened, but I think things haven&#x27;t been good for a while now. My mom and her siblings are intentionally very vague; they haven&#x27;t even told my grandparents. I understand not wanting to spook the parents but don&#x27;t know if I agree. I know I would want to know as soon as possible if my firstborn were on death&#x27;s doorstep.
My uncle&#x27;s been smoking since before I was born, so it&#x27;s not like we couldn&#x27;t have foreseen this coming. But I think my grandpa doing the same without issue well into his eighties lulled us all into a false sense of security. The timing stunned me, not least because we found out at com…</span>

may has arrived at my doorstep, bringing about a new wave of loneliness that doesn’t scream, but thrums.
twenty-three-almost-twenty-four lonely years.
there’s a deep longing for a partner; someone to share everything with. yes, I can do that with my friends, but there’s a line of intimacy that i can’t quite seem to breach. it’s thin, but sturdy. a reminder that the people in my life right now are platonic.
there are dreams of a figure, never a face, that holds me in my sleep. dreams of the hazy silhouette of a five year old running down the stairs; of a home full of laughter and silly tiles and stained glass. dreams of someone who sits beside me on a hot day, complaining about the heatwave that has southeast asia in a vice grip.
there’s never a face.…</span>

                              <span>The best advice I got in college was from a senior. &quot;Pick the teacher not the course&quot; he told me. This was contrary to the general method. Everyone picked a course based on how lenient the grading was or interest.
I respected the guy so decided to follow his advice. I chose &#x27;Computational Complexity&#x27; as an elective. A subject I had no interest in. The Prof was known for strict grading and the material was supposed to be really tough. It was all theory. No practical coding. On paper it was the worst choice I could have made. It turned out to be the best course I ever took.
In my college you can sit for am elective course for first week or two before committing to it. Kind of like window shopping for knowledge. So I decided to check the course out. I knew nothing about it. Had no interest as well. It quickly changed. The Prof teaching it had a passion that was infectious. He would encourage doubts. If someone asked something silly he would say &quot;ah! it seems trivial on the face of it but reveals deeper complexities&quot; with a happy glint in his eyes. There were no stupid questions in his class. So I chose the teacher not the course. Going with my gut and my seniors advice against all common sense. Only 11 other people in the entire college took the course.
I had the most fun in those classes. Learned so much. Fell in love with formal proof writing. Had my mind blown several times. The extra class hours spend absorbing the material, making my way through new proofs felt effortless.
It taught me a lesson that I always keep in mind. Environment matters. The people you surround yourself with matter. Whether in work or personal life. Anything can become interesting, profound and world changing if done with right people.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m soon traveling to Seattle for work. Surprisingly, I&#x27;m more anxious about this trip than seems reasonable, and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve traveled, nor is it even the first time I&#x27;ve gone to Seattle for work. It&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;m going there. Now that I think about it, I can see how the first time was kind of traumatizing in some ways. Perhaps talking about it would help me work through it.
Let&#x27;s start from the beginning...
Last time I went, I flew from my country to Mexico City, and then from there to Seattle. I took the same route on the way back. Overall, it was fairly quick and was by far the best option offered by the travel agency that the company I work for uses (all the other routes were waaay longer or had a lot more legs).

Painful disinflation is and always has been about getting wage inflation down. Forget payroll employment, the big news […]

                              <span>I have always been lazy and ambitious. My life mostly has been a weird experiment in combining the two. Being ambitious means I want to achieve a lot, something that required hard work. Being lazy means, well I would rather not work hard.
And no this is not some post about smart work. I never understood smart work anyways. It assumes people are dumb and don&#x27;t know how to approach problems from high leverage points. I am not sure if any of these people even exist when you are competing at a high level.
Competing at a high level means you are up against smart crazy human beings willing to burn everything including themselves. You have to grind hard to have a shot. So I had to solve my hard work issue.
I soon realised that my issue was not hard work. It was work that &#x27;felt&#x27; like hard work. I can just program the wet squishy computer between my skull to change the &#x27;feeling&#x27; settings. So hard work feels like a breeze. Even extremely enjoyable.
How can this programming be done? Well the key insight is you can bore yourself to a point that anything is enjoyable. Also you can gaslight yourself into making any mundane task feel grand. So what looks like mundane paperwork to someone on the outside could feel like the holy act of putting ink on paper and rewriting history to you. You get my point right?

                              <span>in this world, we met much later than usual. college roommates, at the cusp of graduation, in an apartment that resembled the 2nd floor of one the many homes i&#x27;ve left behind. i don&#x27;t remember what you were studying this time around, but your room was always filled with music and the murmur of your friends&#x27; voices.
we lived like strangers for the most part. our schedules never coincided. we were never home at the same time. we spoke infrequently and only via alphabet magnets on our fridge.
&quot;fod here&quot;, &quot;tysm&quot;, &quot;rain tom&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;was loud?&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;
then finally — an intersection. carpooling home from a mutual friend&#x27;s party, squished together in the back seat. i was nodding off and you guided my head to your shoulder. i tell you that it&#x27;s been a while since i&#x27;ve seen you, so you promise to develop a habit of forgetting your keys.
from there, it blurs together. the bump of the road, the hair on my cheek, the itch of your sweater, the gentle hand on my thigh.
i know i&#x27;m meant to love you in every lifetime we meet.</span>

                              <span>The increasing dominance of large firms in the United States has raised concerns about pricing power in the product market. The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation.

In the morning we went out to a breakfast place, courtesy of our host. When the waitress took our orders, I watched as my coworkers and hosts each ordered a cup of coffee along with their food. During breakfast, they talked about how important coffee is to a scientific workplace.
At our institute, there is a single set of coffee machines on the top floor, set up to encourage interactions among scientists.
When scientists take social breaks, it&#x27;s often coded as &quot;coffee break&quot;. One scientist even wrote an opinion piece encouraging more socialization in science through coffee breaks.
The problem is that I don&#x27;t drink coffee. Honestly, I barely take in caffeine. I used to drink black tea in the morning irregularly, then I tried …</span>

                              <span>The Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
acts as the main connection between the kubelet
and the Container Runtime.
Those runtimes have to provide a gRPC server which has to
fulfill a Kubernetes defined Protocol Buffer interface.
This API definition
evolves over time, for example when contributors add new features or fields are
going to become deprecated.
In this blog post, I&#x27;d like to dive into the functionality and history of three
extraordinary Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are truly outstanding in
terms of how they work: Exec, Attach and PortForward.
Exec can be used to run dedicated commands within the container and stream
the output to a client like kubectl or
crictl. It also allows interaction with
that process using standard input (stdin), for example if users want t…</span>

                              <span>With the release of Kubernetes 1.30, the feature to prevent the modification of the volume mode
of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

I thought that instead of typing up another rant, I&#x27;d do something a bit different. I want to share a little anecdote with you.
Around 20 years ago, I joined the British Army; right at the height of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.
Yeah, I&#x27;ve never been the sharpest tool in the box.
Anyway, Iraq was shit. I lost a couple of friends, more were badly hurt, and I myself suffered a minor shrapnel wound.
It&#x27;s fair to say that I saw shit out there that no-one should ever see. I finished my tour of Iraq and less than a year later I found myself in Afghanistan.
For me, Afghan was marginally better than Iraq. I won&#x27;t go into detail as to why as that could reveal who I am, but suffice to say, it wasn&#x27;t quite as shit as Iraq.
I got back from Afghan and I was fucked. Not physically though. Mentally. The Army might spin this yarn that they give their troops the help they need, but the fact of the matter is, if you went to the &quot;Med Centre&quot; claiming you were having mental health problems, you&#x27;d quickly become a laughing stock of the battalion.
You&#x27;d be labelled a pussy. A fanny. Not tough enough be a soldier.
Note: This might not be the case anymore. It&#x27;s been a long time since I served, but that&#x27;s what it was like then I was serving.
So I didn&#x27;t get help, and it utterly fucked me. I was having nightmares. I was taking it out on my loved ones. I was all over the show.
Then my (now) wife convinced me to go see a professional to help me process some of this baggage.
I did, and it really helped. Actually, it was one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done. Do I still have demons? Yes. Do I let them affect my life? For the most part, no.
So, my message to you is - whether you&#x27;re a soldier, a police officer, a fire fighter, a janitor, an office worker, or anything else - if you have shit going on upstairs, don&#x27;t let it fester. Go and see someone about it. Someone impartial, who can just listen and help you process that shit.
You can thank me later.
Peace. ✌️

The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking

As expected, there were no changes to the neoliberal policies promoted and imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions. A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

validating admission webhooks, it may be interesting to read our

If you have already heard about ValidatingAdmissionPolicies and you are eager to try them out,

Example admission webhook
First, let&#x27;s take a look at an example of a simple webhook. Here is an excerpt from a webhook that

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.
A container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out

I was born and raised in Delhi, India. I have always had this sense of wonder about the world. I grew up reading a lot. Mostly fiction. Hard SciFi, High Fantasy, you get the idea. I was good at academics and my parents kinda lemme do whatever I wanted. Ever since I was 10 I had my own room ,no oversight and an internet connection(yeah ik could have been a disaster). I discovered so much. From the VlogBrothers to Richard Feynman. Changed so much. For the better. Mostly.
I recently graduated with a CS degree. It was challenging and fun tbh. Mostly cuz of the absolutely cracked people I met here and a few passionate profs. These days I write firmware for enterprise servers. Servers you definitely have interacted with unless you live under a rock(how are you reading this then?).
This blog is just me. I decided to put myself out there more. Share my honest thoughts and opinions. Who knows maybe I will say something profound that changes someones life? If not at least a part of my consciousness will be in the future AGI training dataset. Not bad eh?</span>

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

                              <span>Governments increasingly use export controls to limit the spread of domestic cutting-edge technologies to other countries.

Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>
