                              <span>The Indie Web is a great place. Ever since I started writing on this website, I&#x27;ve received the most heartwarming reactions—from plain old emails to guestbook comments, and in some cases, even reply posts that can spark discussions in what might otherwise feel like posting into the void.
A reply post like this was RE: Why Are Shoes Treated Differently Than Shirts by Marisabel, which really made me think about stuff I wrote in my original post. I loved that! She mentioned me on Mastodon, and I thanked her for the reply, it really made my day back then.
Last week, I discovered another reply through the analytics page of my bear blog, which had a referrer I wasn’t familiar with—mgx. I visited the website and found a reply post to my bat incident! It had a short poem about it, which made me laugh and brightened my day, especially since I was feeling quite sick after the vaccine.
I wanted to thank mgx for the reply, but I couldn’t find a way to contact on the website. Obviously, not everyone wants to be approachable, and I understand that, but I still wanted to acknowledge the reply—so here we are!</span>

The lack of democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth. More

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant referred to Israel’s assault on Gaza as a fight against “human animals.” Other Israeli officials called for erasing Gaza from the face of the earth, claiming that no Palestinian civilians are innocent.

The advantage of this strategy is if the experiment doesn&#x27;t work out, terminating freelancers is much easier than permanent (I noted you&#x27;re based in Europe).
Contrary to what other people said, I wouldn&#x27;t try find a CTO straightaway. It&#x27;s a hard role to hire for, especially at the start. I think you&#x27;re better off unleashing a small, excellent team of builders then hire management later to help build out the team if the initial effort succeeds.
Happy to chat more about my experiences with this strategy, davedx@gmail.com (I&#x27;m in Europe too)</span>

                              <span>I used to be a tree-style-tabs power user but at some point I went back to regular tabs. I find that the amount of horizontal tab space is pretty close to the actual number of things I can usefully have open at once. Seeing the tabs get &quot;squished&quot; is my reminder to close the ones I no longer need.
I was using the tab-state as a sort of short-term working memory and I don&#x27;t think it was doing me any favours, particularly in terms of focus.
Now when I&#x27;m working on a project, I keep a list of relevant URLs in a text file (i.e. bookmarks but checked into source control).
I also use two browser windows, a regular one for &quot;stateful&quot; browsing, and a private-mode one for &quot;stateless&quot; browsing. Quick queries and exploratory research happens in the &quot;stateless&quot; session, with the understanding that I can close any of these tabs (or nuke the whole session) at any time without losing anything important. If I do come across something important, it gets noted down elsewhere.</span>

                              <span>I would argue the opposite. They are not aiming to be a neutral arbiter but an active advocate for better repairability. For that they should have for-profit business relationships with basically all companies manufacturing such devices. In particular, that would allow them to pressure or drop any one misbehaving company.
&gt; Providing consumers with information on where to find reputable companies selling repair parts would be a much more palatable alternative to selling them yourself.
That does not really make sense. They are a repair company and the only company selling specialized parts is, of course, the manufacturer.
&gt; also stands in the way of advocating for consumers.
That is much too bleak. They made a deal happen in the first place, which is large progress even if it did not quite work out, and compromises are a fact of life.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;41189189">

                              <span>I think many might not be aware of Starliner&#x27;s sordid history. It has failed essentially every qualification test in various ways. Their pad abort test (where you simulate a launch abort while on the launch pad) resulted in only 2 of the 3 parachutes deploying in beyond optimal conditions. NASA considered that such a resounding success that they let them completely skip the far more challenging in-flight abort test. Their first automated mission to the ISS completely failed and did not make it to the station. NASA finally required a redo from Boeing and their second one did make it to the ISS, but only after experiencing widespread leaks and thruster failures literally identical to the ones that have now left these astronauts stranded.
If SpaceX or another company had remotely similar results, they would never have been greenlit. For instance in spite of a flawless pad abort test, NASA required SpaceX also carry out an in-flight abort. And that&#x27;s completely reasonable - you don&#x27;t simply skip tests, even with optimal performance. Skipping tests following suboptimal performance is simply unjustifiable. And so I think we&#x27;re largely looking at another Challenger type disaster caused by a disconnect between management (and likely political appointees) versus engineering staff, rather than inherent risk. But this is not a vessel that should have ever had a single human anywhere near it, and so their official comments (and even actions) on the situation are going to be heavily biased due to their own behaviors.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, I read a post by Bearly Significant titled: &quot;Headlines Terrify Me&quot;. The post talked about the nuances of creating the perfect headline, that one time they made a typo, and their fear of sabotaging themselves with their words.
The post starts:
Crafting an effective headline is an art form mastered only by the finest journalists and editors. In fewer words than a tweet, all nuances and &quot;yes, buts&quot; must be simplified. This is crucial because journalists are taught to always consider: &quot;if someone only reads the headline, will they be somewhat informed?&quot;
Although the blog post was geared more towards the news sector, I can’t help but think that there is some parallelism with how bloggers craft their blog post titles.
I think everyone has their own flavor of titling their posts that works with their niche, and blogging voice. I follow a few who title their blog posts…
In a super vague way that makes you want to click on the post to understand what their title means
Short and straight to the point - you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into and the topic of the post
A poetic title that encompasses the topic of the post
A few words excerpt from their actual post
…and so on.
I think I do a mixture of some of the above. I tend to lean towards a blog title that evokes the same emotion as what I’m writing about. If it’s a more poetic piece, I title it as such. If it’s more casual, the title also tends to be. Although there are times when my posts tend to be vague, the goal is to rarely make the title vague. I always want you to know what you’re getting into so you can choose to read, or pass on my posts. I hate clickbait, and so I try to avoid that as much as I can.
My blog is pretty straight forward. What you see is typically what you get.

                              <span>Hello fellow blogger,
I found your blog and the &quot;Finding my Blogging Voice&quot; post through Bear&#x27;s &#x27;Most Recent&#x27; feed and felt like writing a reply.
It&#x27;s wonderful to see that you got your first post out there. A good and interesting one too, that many bloggers can relate to. Now that you&#x27;re up and running, the hardest part is over.
I&#x27;ve been in a similar situation myself and understand how you feel. My advice is to not overthink it and just keep writing and posting, writing and posting, writing and posting...
I always find myself thinking I could do better, write better, be better.
We can all do better, and the only way to achieve it is by consistently publishing content. Plus, what we consider our &quot;best writing&quot; today, will be replaced by &quot;even better&quot; soon. Looking back at what I thought was my &quot;best writing ever&quot; five years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t even publish it today.
Besides, we&#x27;re terrible at being our own critics. We&#x27;ll post texts we believe are outstanding, only to see them go by unnoticed. And we&#x27;ll post texts we hesitate to share, which end up being our most read ever.
Blogging is like a school without final exams, that’s what makes it so valuable and rewarding.
Just keep on blogging and never skip class.
Good luck!

The original post by &quot;Thoughtless Ramblings&quot; made ripples in cyberspace. Another great example of the beauty of blogging. A first post was all it took...

I had a hard time finding my voice. I always felt like I needed to perform for someone with my writing. Took me a while to feel comfortable just writing for myself and to get stuff out of my head. And I think the way I see it now is like I&#x27;m doing an impromptu presentation and some people might stop and listen. — Juan Villela</span>

 Reports suggested that Blue Carbon—a company privately owned by Sheikh Ahmed al-Maktoum, a member of Dubai&#x27;s ruling family—had signed deals—a land grab enacted in the name of climate change mitigation. In response, Blue Carbon insisted the discussions were merely exploratory and would require (...)

                              <span>I&#x27;m very skeptical on this, the paper they linked is not convincing. It says that GPT-4 is correct at predicting the experiment outcome direction 69% of the time versus 66% of the time for human forecasters. But this is a silly benchmark because people are not trusting human forecasters in the first place, that&#x27;s the whole purpose for why the experiment is run. Knowing that GPT-4 is slightly better at predicting experiments than some human guessing doesn&#x27;t make it a useful substitute for the actual experiment.</span>

                              <span>I listened to the whole conference and here&#x27;s my impression:
1. NASA manager Steve Stich said there&#x27;s a relatively wide &quot;band of uncertainty&quot; in how risky a Starliner return is. Some (many?) NASA engineers are at the high end of the band and are advocating a return on Dragon instead. Boeing is obviously at the low end of the band and thinks it is a low risk.
The problem is, the data doesn&#x27;t rule out either side of the band. So they are trying to get more data to narrow the uncertainty (in either or both directions). [Interestingly enough, the data from the White Sands testing made them more worried because it revealed the Teflon seal deformation.]
But my sense is that if they don&#x27;t narrow the uncertainty (i.e., convince the NASA engineers) then they will very likely choose a Dragon return.…</span>

                              <span>I’ve built quite a few french drains in residential settings, some lasting longer than others - I’ll share a few hard earned lessons here:
Soil migration is the number one failure mode. This is mentioned but perhaps a bit understated in the video.
To prevent soil migration you absolutely need commercial grade geotextile fabric wrapping the gravel and pipe.
You can buy pipe with much bigger and more numerous holes than the tiny slits depicted in the video. That also obviates the need to decide what orientation the holes should be.
Void space is the most critical factor when choosing gravel. You need a lot of space between the rocks to support fast drainage. Do not use playground pebbles or anything similar. Pay close attention to the type of aggregate you’re buying.
Calculate how much water you actually need to drain. You can use the “100 year flood” values for your locale to get an upper bound on rainfall, then multiple by drainage area. This is especially important if your roof is part of the watershed.
https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/sci...
Sometimes there is insufficient gradient to move the water anywhere, ie the land is too flat. In this case you may be better off building a drywell, which is constructed very similarly.

                              <span>There are many ways I come up with blog post topics to publish. Most days, I sit down in front of my computer (or phone) and allow myself to just type, see what comes out, and then refine. Other times, I write intentional posts about topics that I have been ruminating on. Then there are moments when my emotions run so strong that I have to express them before I explode. I guess such was the case yesterday.
Of course, there are other ways. I have a list of topics I want to get to one day, but those have been mostly ignored. They overwhelm me too much.
Anyways, that&#x27;s not the intention of this post.
The best topics come to me in the most inopportune times, and so half the time, they never see the light of day. I often find myself coming up with things I want to write about in that space betw…</span>

                              <span>Has labor demand changed since the COVID-19 pandemic? In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.</span>

Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about
yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
David: I started working on
OpenShift (the Red Hat
distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My
first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl
(kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth (RBAC and *Review APIs are ports
from OpenShift), apps (workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others,
but API Machinery is still my favorite :)

                              <span>Just in response to your second point, I do think that&#x27;s specific to you and your circles. I know multiple retired or semi-retired people who have moved towards the center of a city. Without work to keep them occupied, they want the hustle and bustle, which means something to do. And driving has become more of a hassle and a barrier to the kinds of lives they want to live. These are east coast or midwest cities, so maybe there is something about SF that&#x27;s different, but that&#x27;s my experience.</span>

                              <span>This pitch worked much better in the 80s and 90s when
A) most investors had a broker not just for advice, but because there was no easy way to trade individually or get live stock quotes until the internet was widespread and matured
B) telephone sales in general were more common then and less likely to be a scam (Stratton Oakmont and other boiler rooms played a large role in shifting public opinion on this)
C) The most desirable prospects (High Net Worth Individuals) were accustomed to dealing with legitimate brokers over the phone and being solicited by brokers from other legitimate firms in such a way
D) The markets were raging in such a way that everyone had FOMO and was dying to hear of a hot new tip
Almost nobody legitimate in the financial advising world acquires customers via cold call pitching anymore. Cold calling is still part of the toolkit for other sales niches (eg, tech sales) but it&#x27;s a tough road with a low success rate.</span>

                              <span>There is a famous paper about the location of company headquarters: they get as close as possible to the residence of company CEOs. If we don&#x27;t consider the CEO&#x27;s influence, I&#x27;m actually curious if the location of company headquarters has to do with the average age of the employees in the Bay Area. As the employees start to have families, they most likely move to the south bay for better or for worse, and I have a hard time imagine that they&#x27;d enjoy commuting via BART or Caltrain for more than an hour every day. And this is probably just me or my circles, a city&#x27;s hustle and bustle becomes a distraction or at least increasing irrelevant as I age. I increasingly enjoy ample parking space, tranquil suburbs, being able to step out and start jogging in woods or huge parks, and certainly not having to deal with the craziness on SF streets. If more people are like me who prefers living outside of the city proper, then I&#x27;d imagine a company will have access to more talent by moving its headquarters to the south of SF.</span>

Maybe they will have better luck in Santa Clara.
I don’t buy any of the flamebait reasons for leaving SF. Reason 1 is money and reason 2 is talent pool.</span>

                              <span>Good job releasing your project! It&#x27;s a cool idea and surprisingly minimalist. That said, I&#x27;ve found a number of cryptographic flaws in the application source. This should not be used in instances where the encryption is mission-critical.
1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it&#x27;s far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.
2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.
3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.
4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (&quot;#&quot;) which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it&#x27;s important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the &quot;#&quot;. If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).

I disagree. 100% they had a better product, but they have absolutely mangled it over the last few updates. Honestly, if I wanted the opinion of randomnumbers45123 on Reddit, I&#x27;d just search Reddit.
Google achieved dominance ~25 years ago by being better than the alternatives, and the other search engines pretty much withered away rapidly. They (Google) are in a very precarious position right now. They will certainly not disappear overnight, but if / when the public becomes aware of something better, the implosion could be spectacular.</span>

                              <span>I want to blog but have never posted. I start a draft and work on it for hours and days, but I never think it&#x27;s good enough. I always think that I could do better, write better, be better. For so long all I&#x27;ve written is essays and official memos, I find it hard to let down my standards and be natural.
My recent resume is working against me; four years of college with essays and lab reports, and a year at a corporate job with professional communications. Writing off the cuff to a casual audience doesn&#x27;t come as easy to me as it once did. Somehow I need to undo the last five years of training and relearn simplicity and sincerity.
This is my first post and I don&#x27;t expect it to make a splash, but rather just a drop in the sea of writers online. My real goal with this post and others are to find my &quot;blogging voice&quot;, a version of myself who can write freely without worrying so much about the particulars.
I&#x27;m afraid this post will join the myriad others on BearBlog in the &quot;meta-blogging&quot; category; blogging about blogging. While that may be true for this first entry, I&#x27;m hoping to expand my writing in the coming months, I just hope someone will join me on that journey.</span>

                              <span>One of the houses I visited at work today had an absolutely stunning view of the sea. I could have easily stayed there all day.
When I mentioned how amazing the location was, the owner of the house replied, &quot;Yeah, but you don&#x27;t think about it after a while.&quot;
It should be illegal to live like that if you don&#x27;t even appreciate it, I thought as I walked back to my car. I started driving away and caught myself...
But what about me? I&#x27;m basically the same.
I don&#x27;t live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.
How often do I think about it? Hardly ever.
Yet, it&#x27;s something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.
Okay, it&#x27;s never going to be like &quot;the first high&quot; again, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Just a tenth of the first experience is still immensely precious and rewarding.
A tiny bit of awareness is all it takes to start observing and appreciating our surroundings. Let&#x27;s remind ourselves of the beauty of the mundane.</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been feeling upset and frustrated about some of the things happening in my life. I’m screaming into the unknown because I’m not really sure what else to do. The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.
Talking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.
I have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.
Every day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.
I just need to figure out how.

I was having a phone call with my best friend last night. I know he&#x27;s going through a really tough time and has been for a while. I felt anxious and stressed about whether or not I could be a good friend / what he needed. I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.
So why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I&#x27;ve always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me. It&#x27;s always been hard for me to get close to even my best friends. I really abused the shit out of &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t need your help&quot;. Despite that, it felt like it really degenerated during lockdowns, to the point where I&#x27;ve had troub…</span>

This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s insane the length we go as humans (in the US at least) to not invest in the easiest, most cost-effective and environmentally friendly mode of transportation: trains.
Hyperloops, wider and wider highways, now personal airplanes.
Anything but goddamn trains.
It&#x27;s mental to me.
Wish the best to the startup, after all they are filling a void someone else would, but still, not happy with the direction transport is going, which seems backwards sometimes.</span>

                              <span>Instrument-rated pilot (and engineer) here.
First - congrats on the launch! I think you&#x27;re working on an interesting set of components that will prove useful to GA aircraft technology. Bringing fly-by-wire, and lowering the cost of maintenance/manufacturing are both great efforts.
That being said, my personal view is that stick-and-rudder control is one of the less critical components to improving GA safety. Everything else - flight planning, comms, automation, navigation, weather, inspections, procedures, regs, and most importantly - working in the federal airspace system - are the &quot;hard&quot; parts of flying and where problems tend to occur. It&#x27;s common belief that single-pilot IFR is the most challenging type of flying, because of how much you have to do all at once.
It may sound snobby - but I&#x27;m not super excited about the idea of lowering the barrier to entry for GA on a foundational skill basis. Like the light-sport rating, it encourages more people to be in the (already congested) airspace system who haven&#x27;t really gained all the other skills necessary or experience to be there.
To be clear - I think improving technology and lowering costs &#x3D; good. Lowering early-skill requirements for pilots and pushing more people without all the other skills into federal airspace &#x3D; very bad. In general, I&#x27;d frame this effort more as an effort to raise the bar for system technology, not lower the bar to become a pilot in the first place.</span>

                              <span>I expect this to be bad for everyone except Google if the ruling holds. Why? Mozilla and Apple will lose significant revenue from having Google as the default search engine and Google will no longer have to pay those billions. What&#x27;s more, no one else can pay to be the default either (eg the short-lived Mozilla Bing deal).
So what&#x27;s going to happen? Most users will probably still use Google, nobody is getting paid and Google is saving a bundle.
I get the thinking that you have to prevent lock-in (eg Ticketmaster and venues) but Google didn&#x27;t buy its way into dominance annd maintain their dominance through exclusivity deals. They simply have a better product and I don&#x27;t expect anyone to match them anytime soon (cue the DDG &quot;I switched from Google to DDG 78 years ago&quot; crowd).</span>

                              <span>We face a number of challenges simply letting our paying customers change their search engine:
1. On iOS the list of allowed search engines is simply baked into OS, we have a fiddly extension that hooks outbound calls to /search and redirects them but I wish we didn&#x27;t need to.
2. On Chrome, we use an extension to change the default search engine and enable search auto-complete etc, but Google has a policy that such an extension can do one thing and one thing only, and recently removed our extension on account of that [1]. We rebuilt it to meet their needs but had a lot of back-and-forth because we included &#x27;search by image&#x27; on a context menu item and the first reviewer felt that was a bridge too far. You&#x27;ll note that Chrome provides such a context menu item for Google Image search out of the box.
3. On Chrome for Linux, the default search engine API is not available, so Linux users have to configure it manually through a series of silly steps [2]. This is at least in keeping with most Linux experiences.
There are other issues, but I say all this to highlight how surprisingly difficult it is to change this setting in a practical, consumer friendly way. It is most certainly this difficult by design, that&#x27;s a lot of revenue to protect.

                              <span>Hacker News, thank you for all the links and all the great reading. Now I have to say goodbye.
I’m with my wife Bess (https://bessstillman.substack.com/) and my brother Sam, and crying, but it is okay. At the end of Lord of the Rings Gandalf says to the hobbits, &quot;Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.” And that is how I feel now. Ending prematurely hurts, but all things must end, and my time to end is upon me.</span>

I&#x27;ve only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.
Really, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It&#x27;s like independent music. You&#x27;re writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.
It&#x27;s pretty punk, actually. Running your own corner of the internet is like recording an album in your bedroom and then selling it at the shows you independently worked with bars and venu…</span>

                              <span>Long after I&#x27;d finished creating the theme for this blog, I still thought the design was spot on (and still do). It&#x27;s the ideal theme in my opinion.
Recently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: &quot;It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It&#x27;s so incredibly boring!&quot;
I&#x27;d never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It&#x27;s true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.
Anyway, that, combined with Lou&#x27;s post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It&#x27;s always exciting and inspiring to try something different.
I plan to use Bear&#x27;s official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I&#x27;m also considering some larger changes as separate &#x27;add-ons&#x27;.
If I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it. I&#x27;m not a professional designer (and have a full-time job), so Bear with me — it might take a while...or never get finished.</span>

 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…</span>

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…</span>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…</span>

                              <span>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a rapidly growing ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology, primarily on the Ethereum network. These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.</span>

Never have I tested anything and NOT found a bug, and most things I tested I thought were already OK to ship.
Thus, when you delete your tests, the only person you are fooling is probably yourself :(
From reading your page I get the impression you are more burnt out from variation/configuration management which is completely relatable… I am too. This is a hard problem. But user volume is required to make $$. If the problem was easy then the market would be saturated with one size fits all solutions for everything.</span>

&gt; I used this project as an opportunity to learn about Rust and FUSE file systems. I also think it&#x27;s hilarious.
&gt; Visitors interested in the code should note that this is 
 an irredeemably messy codebase—it&#x27;s full of hacks, unidiomatic code, and wildly poor design decisions.
&gt; However, visitors should also 
note that that&#x27;s okay. The 
best way to learn something 
new is to try it out for 
yourself—and creating a mess 
is a vital part of that 
process.
I absolutely love this sentiment. Why do this? Because it’s fun. And messy. And sometimes, that’s okay. Not everything needs to be a product… sometimes it’s enough to do something because you can… or want to… or because $RANDOM reason. I’m very grateful to the author and whoever decided to submit it today.</span>

                              <span>It depends how you define normal. Winter this year, or certainly in July, and absolutely since the recent Sudden Stratospheric Warming event, has felt distinctly chillier. But the bad news is, no this winter, when compared to the long term average, isn’t all that much cooler than “normal”. Despite the relatively cool conditions, most capitals […]</span>

                              <span>I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.
But there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can&#x27;t help but hire you. Can&#x27;t help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.
This is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.
What happened to being that intense &#x27;Steve Job&#x27; type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.
It goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don&#x27;t just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.</span>

                              <span>The summer term is over! I&#x27;m back in my hometown, bothering my dogs and following my grandmother around the house like a little kid. I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to settle for almost there. I&#x27;ll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.
School aside, there&#x27;s nothing much to write about today. The sky&#x27;s been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good. Thank God for bread.
I&#x27;m starting and abandoning so many new posts. I couldn&#x27;t settle on any of them, so I decided to do this one instead. Hope you had some good bread in your life today!</span>

Or you&#x27;re stressing over something and they scream at you to CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!
Oh okay! I didn&#x27;t think about it that way! I&#x27;m so silly 🤪
For real though, one of the things about getting older is caring less about what people think. I used to think my dad looked so lame wearing 10 year old, $7 jeans from Walmart, generic black tennis shoes and a plain solid color tee shirt all the time like he&#x27;s some kinda Seinfeld character. Meanwhile I was straightening my blonde emo-ver hair, wearing skin tight skinny jeans with a pink studded belt from Spencer&#x27;s and walking around in loud, multicolor, just... massive tongued skating shoes.
These days, half the time I&#x27;m at work anyway so I&#x27;m wearing a long-sleev…</span>

                              <span>Today, I realized that the past three days share something important and beautiful: community.
Today, the pride parade took place here in Stockholm. I met up with my mom, sister, her husband, and their kids, who had come to the city for the occasion. It was wonderful sharing the event with them.
Yesterday, I decided to return to Mastodon. I missed the community and created a new account (birming@social.lol). Thank you all for the warm welcome. You&#x27;re amazing!
The day before yesterday, I decided to continue this blog. Since then, I&#x27;ve received wonderful feedback from you readers. It&#x27;s made me happy, grateful, and motivated. Thank you all!
Three days, three different experiences, but one common thread: community. It&#x27;s easy to overlook this invaluable aspect of life. However, when it&#x27;s absent, we truly understand its significance.
So, dear friends, thank you for being part of my life.</span>
