Defenders of Israel as “the only democracy in the Middle East” had their hands full last month, particularly when it came to freedom of the press, a cornerstone of genuine democracies. On May 5, Al Jazeera reported that its offices in East Jerusalem — internationally recognized Palestinian territory occupied by Israel — were raided and shut down by Israeli police following the banning of the news network by the Israeli government. Al Jazeera continues to operate in the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but is still barred from reporting or broadcasting in Israel proper. Then, on May 21, the Associated Press reported that Israeli authorities had confiscated AP’s equipment in Southern Israel, despite the news agency submitting to Israeli military censorship. AP’s equipment was eventually returned, but only after the United States’ government intervened on behalf of the US company. Across the border, in the Gaza Strip, the situation for journalists was much more dire. Among the more than 37,266 Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israeli genocide, as reported by Al Jazeera, were at least 103 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

I initially had my doubts about this place, and even opted to skip out on it the first time we encountered it on Yelp. Then during a mental health day back in May (05/02), we decided to go check it out. After all, it had a 4.7⭐ rating on Yelp, so maybe some of these people knew what they were talking about (plus LSC really wanted to try it out).
I will be the first to admit that I 1000% regret my decision to have skipped out on it the first time. I loved it, and am already wanting to go back again.
We went during a Thursday for a late-ish lunch so it was pretty quiet. It&#x27;s an alley (duh), and it is street parking only within some kind of neighborhood. They also only have outdoor seating, and you order through a window at the end of the alley. They were super nice, and even handed us a dog water bowl when they saw Cocoa.

House Grilled Pork Belly Rice bowl with seaweed, pickled ginger, pickled carrots/jalapenos, gingered kale, soft boiled egg, crispy noodles, and pickled cucumbers.
I ordered the dish pictured above ($19) and it was absolutely delicious. The pork belly was tender (melt in your mouth softness), and incredibly flavorful. For the rice bowl, you also have the option to choose your protein such as tofu ($18), grilled brisket burger ($19) or bamboo grilled prawns ($21). When I go back, I may be tempted to get it again, although I probably should try out other things on the menu.

The entrance has their full menu, so you&#x27;ll know what to order prior to going to the window.

actual alley, and all the way at the end to the right is where you order.</span>

Intro
I have been “delving” into jax and einsum notation lately in my quest to become a shape-rotator.
This post is divided into two parts. In the first part, we go through einsum notation basics. The second part is about understanding simple transformer code in jax which uses a lot of einsum.
From your end, I want some brains (no I am not a zombie, I just want your attention). I also assume knowledge of numpy basics, matrix m…</span>

 There is no such thing as human society. 
 A lot of muddled thinking rests on the error that because ‘society’ is a useful noun, it must refer to a thing. It is one of those nouns like ‘journey’ and ‘tennis’, which refers not to a thing but to a relationship between things. The statement ‘human society exists’ is simply a less cumbersome way of saying ‘human individuals relate to each other in certain complicated ways’. The question, ‘what is the purpose of human society?’ means the same as, ‘why do human individuals associate in the way they do?’. 
 Human craving for soci…</span>

                              <span>Hi - author here.
This is a big question tbh and the lack of a succession plan is a function of many things:
1. This was my dad&#x27;s baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one&#x27;s mortality which I also believe was difficult for him.
2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering/science of the company made us a non-starter.
3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession/exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly.
There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I&#x27;ve thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those &quot;play the cards you&#x27;re dealt&quot; kind of situations.
Thanks for reading.</span>

                              <span>It absolutely melts my mind every time I come across the two facts that:
- People experience their thoughts very differently
- We all secretly believe that deep down, everyone experiences thought like we do.
I&#x27;ve never really had a strong internal monologue when thinking, so my assumption would always be that of course, thinking isn&#x27;t very linguistic (even if we can use it as a tool while thinking).
It seems like there&#x27;s a large number of people who experience their thought exclusively as language.
That sounds absolutely nuts to me, but I&#x27;ve heard people say the exact same in reverse. Even more fringe is that there&#x27;s a sizable number of people who when thinking about words (i.e. remembering names) visualize their words as text. What!? I can&#x27;t imagine that anymore than I can imagine how a jellyfish feels?

Every time I search on the start menu there is a web search, impossible to turn off. How is that acceptable?
I install Edge Beta to test something, and the I uninstall it. All of the sudden my search provider in my normal Edge is reset.
And the nagging everywhere. No I don&#x27;t want &#x27;back-up&#x27; my files (OneDrive is not backup, it&#x27;s sync). And I don&#x27;t want to be reminded later. I don&#x27;t want to be reminded ever. All this fuzzy language makes me feel like I&#x27;m dealing with a kindergarden teacher addressing his/her pupils.
It&#x27;s not my computer any more.
Oh, I update a driver. And 2 days later Windows installs an older version. Since when is 6.6.1.40 better than 6.6.1.72? Why would you do that?</span>

And they blew it! Further, they had the means to feed everyone, clothe everyone, house everyone, but they just walked away in the other direction, purely to maintain existing economic power structures.&quot; The future historians are going to wonder how strong our ideology was that we sacrificed all of what we could have at the altar of our scarcity-based religion.

                              <span>There is no greater folly of contemporary human society than the purposeful restriction of such vast and easily shareable repositories of knowledge. Perhaps these schemes made sense in the past but with the advent of the internet and independent groups willing to fund all hosting fees, we should move to models of publishing that do not require this restriction of information. Library genesis exists but necessarily must hide and create some friction in the discovery process. A legally unencumbered free library of all books for all people would be the greatest achievement in all of human history. We prevent this achievement due to our attachment to a specific economic system that serves as the current means of financially supporting authors. We must build alternatives to for-profit publishing, and the only resilient and widely acceptable system I can imagine is one where every community owns and controls the means of production upon which they depend for their survival. In such an economic system, the need for automation would be obvious and once implemented, all people would receive the benefits of automation. This would include such a wide allowance for leisure and free time that authors would no longer need to restrict access to their books to extract profits from their value their shared knowledge creates. All people would be free to do what they will.
It would take great effort to build such a system, but open source and digital repositories of machine designs would ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The effort would still be substantial, but what hangs in the balance is the opportunity to assure the freedom of all people and the creation of the most significant repository of knowledge humanity has ever conceived of. If we succeed it will be our greatest achievement as a species.</span>

                              <span>Ah! My people.
I, too, much prefer a rebase-heavy workflow. It allows me to both have a dirty &quot;internal&quot; history and clean up for publication.
As a side-effect, it also makes me comfortable having a mostly linear-history for what I publish, as opposed to a many-branched, merge-heavy one, which I dislike, and makes history confusing.
I reject the argument that a no-rebase, merge-only history &quot;preserves the true history of how commits were created&quot;, because I believe that is irrelevant. What is relevant is what the tree looks like once the merge (or rebase) lands.
Should a merge conflict arise, in a rebase workflow the conflict resolution is folded into the rebased commit, so it looks like it was fine all along. In a merge workflow, the fix is in the separate merge commit. In both cases you still have to handle the merge conflict. And in my opinion it is not significant for the merge conflict resolution to be separate from the original commit itself because, again: what&#x27;s important is the final state of the repo.</span>

                              <span>We recently started using Waymo more often:
- Quality of Lyft and Uber rides have gone down significantly.
- Consistently spacious, clean and quiet cars. You know what you&#x27;ll get.
- AC always works and not up to the whim of the driver.
- No chatty driver to disturb our sleeping baby.
Negatives:
- Rides have usually 10% mark up over Lyft and Uber.
- Pick up and drop off tend to be a small walk from requested locations.
Forgot one more positive - you can choose a soothing music play list in the car and it automatically resumes in the next ride. Small but really nice detail when traveling with a baby.</span>

                              <span>My goto example of a dysfunctional and bureaucratic organization is an example I saw in a finance company I worked for.
I was a on team that we were doing a major project. We basically ran Kanban but had to run &quot;sprints&quot; so we chose 4 week sprints to get it out of the way and we put everything on the board we had to get done that month to stay on track. Our pipeline was setup in such a way that you were required to have a jira ticket to push a commit. We were really crushing our timeline, doing 2x the work we were expected, a really great team honestly. But we opened up bugs and additional features in the middle of our sprints to track our work as we did it.
What this amounted to was maybe us saying we have to do 40 tickets this month, and wed be closing like 80. Everyone should have been thrilled by this development! Well we had a sprint review where some &quot;Senior Project Manager&quot; That wasn&#x27;t really affiliated with our project but was some manager higher up was mad that us opening up new tickets mid sprint and closing them was ruining the org level burn down charts and expected delivery. They wouldn&#x27;t give up on this, and said it was our fault for not estimating better (which sure, but we were beating expectations!). So we did the reasonable thing and improved our estimates! No of course not, we doubled our number of tickets and filled in &quot;placeholder&quot; on half of them, and used them as needed then closed everything out at the end of the sprint, where we were congratulated by everyone for our phenomonal estimation.</span>

                              <span>Often.
I used to run the nuclear power plant on a US Navy submarine. Back around 2006, we were sailing somewhere and Sonar reported that the propulsion plant was much, much louder than normal. A few days later we didn&#x27;t need Sonar to report it, we could hear it ourselves. The whole rear half of the ship was vibrating. We pulled into our destination port, and the topside watch reported that oil pools were appearing in the water near the rear end of the ship. The ship&#x27;s Engineering Officer and Engineering Department Master Chief shrugged it off and said there was no need for it to &quot;affect ship&#x27;s schedule&quot;. I was in charge of the engineering library. I had a hunch and I went and read a manual that leadership had probably never heard of. The propeller that drives the ship is enormous. It&#x27;s held in place with a giant nut, but in between the nut and the propeller is a hydraulic tire, a toroidal balloon filled with hydraulic fluid. Clearly it had ruptured. The manual said the ship was supposed to immediately sail to the nearest port and the ship was not allowed to go back out to sea until the tire was replaced. I showed it to the Engineer. Several officers called me in to explain it to them. And then, nothing. Ship&#x27;s Schedule was not affected, and we continued on the next several-week trip. Before we got to the next port, we had to limit the ship&#x27;s top speed to avoid major damage to the entire propulsion plant. We weren&#x27;t able to conduct the mission we had planned because the ship was too loud. And the multiple times I asked what the hell was going on, management literally just talked over me. When we got to the next port, we had to stay there while the propeller was removed and remachined. Management doesn&#x27;t give a shit as long as it doesn&#x27;t affect their next promotion.
Don&#x27;t even get me started on the nuclear safety problems.</span>

                              <span>This is a well done post, but please note that computers do not in fact use Taylor series for evaluating polynomials. They do use polynomials! (Or, sometimes, rational functions, but I think the recent trend has been toward polynomials only.) They also use transformations like the log(1+x) - log(1-x) one described in this article. (That one is used in fdlibm, a very influential math library, though more modern libraries seem to not use it.)
But the polynomials themselves are usually generated through some other technique, especially the Remez algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm) and modern improvements to it like Sollya&#x27;s (https://sollya.org/) LLL-based floating-point polynomial fitting. It&#x27;s still an active area of research; the RLibM project (https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn349/rlibm/) from Rutgers has introduced a totally new way to fit low-precision polynomials (say, up to 32 bits) using massive linear programming problems (roughly, 4 constraints on 10 variables).

&gt; Knowing very little about USB audio processing, but having cut my teeth in college on 8-bit 8051 processors, I knew what kind of functions tended to be slow. I did a Ctrl+F for “%” and found a 16-bit modulo right in the audio processing code.
That feeling of saving days of work because you remember a clue from previous experience is so good.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Java has evolved significantly since the release of Java 8 in 2014. Java 17, released in 2021, brings a host of new features and improvements that can enhance your code&#x27;s readability, maintainability, and performance. This article will guide you through the key features introduced between Java 8 and Java 17, providing examples of how to migrate your code to take advantage of these new capabilities.
Sealed Classes
Java 17 introduces sealed classes, a powerful feature that enhances Java&#x27;s object-oriented programming model and works seamlessly with pattern matching in switch expressions.
New Syntax:
The sealed keyword declares a sealed class or interface, and the permits clause specifies allowed subclasses:
public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle { }

                              <span>I take inspiration from everything and everyone.
People- First of all, I don&#x27;t know if I would be writing this without my brother, Arun. He was the one who cheered me up when I was depressed and got me out of rock bottom. Next are the two seniors from my college, Ambarish and Saptak. I&#x27;ve learnt a lot about life from these 2 guys than anyone. I thank my college debating club for that.
The war of Art- This book by Steven Pressfield is one of the best things I&#x27;ve read not because of it&#x27;s writing but because if it&#x27;s relatability. I came across this when I was listening to Joe Rogan and he said that he gifted this book to numerous people. I loved the concept of resistance. Previously it was an invisible enemy but now it has a name and concept, which meant it can be defeated.
Brandon Sanderson- He is one of my favourite authors now. I fell in love with him after reading the first mistborn trilogy. It&#x27;s such a perfect series. Then there&#x27;s the Stormlight Archive and it&#x27;s huge complex world. I related with a lot of characters on different aspects(especially kaladin).
Haikyu- One of my favourite animes of all time. It&#x27;s about a bunch of highschool volleyball students and their journey.
It just feels like home whenever you watch it. There is no one main character. There is a story behind every other character and it&#x27;s all really nuanced and realistic. This is just life philosophy packed in the neat package of a sports anime.
Naval Ravikant- I just randomly found him one day on twitter and the rest is history. He just changed my entire thinking through his ideas and his ideas are simple, no bullshit and actionable(if you&#x27;ve been near me in my club you know that I yap a lot about him). He&#x27;s everything I want to be in life. We the game of life and quit it.</span>

                              <span>The Krauthammer Fellowship was launched in 2019, a year after his death, and was established to honor his dedication to  “pursuing truth through honest, rigorous argument,” in the words of the Tikvah Fund’s website, though that description bears absolutely no resemblance to its namesake’s oeuvre. An egregious hack and one-man state-controlled news outlet, Krauthammer ceaselessly churned out bilge throughout his career, with a heavy focus on “America’s special role” in the world, its superficially similar but somehow entirely distinctive  “special place” in the world, and the “special responsibility” the United States must carry on its shoulders as a result.

This retreat from holding power accountable not only discredits the pursuit of truth in the service of justice and the strengthening of democracy but also tends to fall prey to the seductions of corruption, political theater and entertainment.

                              <span>We’ve been on the road to this for a while, and it’s so exciting to see. I switched to injectable prep a few months ago to avoid having to take a daily pill - it’s an injection once every two months, and my doctor told me that the guidance might soon change to once every three months.
It sounds simple but for a lot of people it’s not a trivial thing to take a pill every day or adhere to a strict appointment schedule to get an injection. I’d imagine that adoption &amp; compliance goes way up if it’s that much easier.</span>

I&#x27;m surprised that someone had trouble serving a subpoena on Facebook.
Looking up &quot;Meta&quot; in California Corporation Search brings up everything with &quot;Metal&quot; in it, which is a hassle. Their actual company name is &quot;Meta Platforms, Incorporated&quot;. Search for &quot;Meta Platforms&quot; here.[1] California company registration #2711108.
Subpoenas are sent, using a process server, to their registered agent,
which is Corporation Service Company in Sacramento, a business which exists to receive subpoenas for other companies. And, conveniently, there are process serving companies with offices in the same building, and you can find them by searching for the address of CSC and &quot;process server&quot;, then ignoring the spam results.
Most small claims court web sites explain all this.

If those in power decide to push forward by increasing the penalties, eventually running a Mastodon server will become as risky as getting caught for murder. At that point, it would be naive to run a Mastodon server locally, wouldn&#x27;t it?
P.S. Mind you, the average consumer/user doesn&#x27;t care as long as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are up and running.

Title: The left of capital is sabotaging the anarchist movement: let’s fight back!
Date: June 2024

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

                              <span>Hi,
I don&#x27;t know... Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I&#x27;ve already failed?), seriously.
I&#x27;m a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I&#x27;m failing more.
I work in the technology sector (and IT has more branches than medicine). Specifically, I specialize in databases and server infrastructure. I even have my own setup at home, including cloud, Git, blog, documentation, and various other things. Recently, I became unemployed because I lost my freelance contracts with companies, and on the same day my last contract ended, I took all my savings and paid off what I coul…</span>

                              <span>I heard there was a heatwave going on across the country right now.
I spent quite a few years in the Middle East (in my namesake city) where heat is the norm. I grew up in the East Coast (of the US), where we had 4 seasons, and summers were hot and humid. Now, living in a specific part of the West Coast where summers rarely hit above 70F/21.1C (and rarely humid), we are in our own little cocoon. Like right now, it’s 66F/18.89C (1:52pm).
I’ve been sensitive to temperature (and weather changes in general) for as long as I can remember. High temperatures and barometric pressure changes are two big migraine triggers. So if it’s too hot, raining, or humid… chances are, I’ll be out of commission, or least somewhat more miserable than an average person.
I didn’t know much about San Francisco (and Bay Area in general) prior to moving here 5+ years ago. I think in some ways, I just got lucky. I have a love/hate relationship with this city (more on that later), but in some ways, I think this is where I’m meant to be.
You see…it doesn’t rain here often. We have our rainy season end of the year / a few months into the new year, but that’s pretty much it. In the areas I’ve lived in (and currently live in), it rarely gets hot. The more inland you go, the hotter it could get. Thankfully, the area we are in only gets hot a few weeks in the year. It saves me from suffering too often due to high temperatures.
And so, I’m sending cooling vibes and energy to all those melting in other parts of the country right now. We’ll hit 77F/25C this weekend, and 80F/26.67C at some point next week. Although it may seem mild to many, it’s not something my body is accustomed to anymore.
Anyways, please don’t hate me for writing this. I feel for those struggling right now with the heat, and I really do wish I could share a little bit of our cooling breeze your way.

                              <span>bearblog.dev allows for open discussion and exchange of ideas in a low-stakes way. Putting my thoughts into writing on Bear means there are chances that some readers may open it and engage with it. At that moment, they are actively interpreting and making sense of it based on their own background. I find it liberating to release my raw text entries into the world and see what resonates or sparks new internal discussions for others. There is also a sense of relief in getting ideas that have been swirling in my mind out in the open. Once published, it feels like a task completed. While I don&#x27;t necessarily stay involved in conversations about my posts, I appreciate seeing the ripple effects as others reflect on or debate the topics.</span>

                              <span>I just had a nostalgic moment in my exam hall. It was so quiet except for the sound of the ceiling fan and people&#x27;s footsteps outside. I was looking at the wall clock 45 minutes into my exam (that&#x27;s what I do in exam halls). This particular time, it brought back memories of my childhood (like in 5th or 6th grade) when I used to play Monopoly with my friends during power cuts.
Another memory that recently surfaced depicted my school at 3:30 PM when classes would be over, and there would be clamoring in the corridor until we went to the parking lot. This was triggered by people chatting in front of the exam halls. There is a certain comfort in these noises.
Savor these moments when they happen, but don&#x27;t be jailed by them. Remember, time is a cruel mistress who will make you forget the struggles and just remember the good parts.
It&#x27;s like what Andy says in The Office: &quot;I wish there was a way to know you&#x27;re in the good old days before you&#x27;ve actually left them.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) are growing, but banks support that growth via funding and liquidity insurance. The transformation of activities and risks from banks to a bank-NBFI nexus may have benefits in normal states of the world, as it may result in overall growth in (especially, credit) markets and widen access to a wide range of financial services, but the system may be disproportionately exposed to financial and economic instability when aggregate tail risk materializes. In this post, we consider the systemic implications of the observed build-up of bank-NBFI connections associated with the growth of NBFIs.</span>

                              <span>&gt; compensation packages that truly gifted AI researchers can make now
I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;truly gifted&quot; but, working in this space, I&#x27;ve found that there is very little correlation between comp and quality of AI research. There&#x27;s absolutely some brilliant people working for big names and making serious money,  there&#x27;s also plenty of really talented people working for smaller startups doing incredible work but getting paid less, academics making very little, and even the occasional &quot;hobbyist&quot; making nothing and churning out great work while hiding behind an anime girl avatar.
OpenAI clearly has some talented people, but there&#x27;s also a bunch of the typical &quot;TC optimization&quot; crowd in there these days. The fact that so many were willing to resign with sama if necessary appears largely because they were more concerned with losing their nice compensation packages than any of their obsession with doing top tier research.</span>

                              <span>I understand the concern that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that will escape its bounds and threaten humanity. That is a risk.
My bigger, and more pressing worry, is that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that does not escape its bounds, and the question will be which humans control it. Look no further than history to see what happens when humans acquire great power. The &quot;cold war&quot; nuclear arms race, which brought the world to the brink of (at least partial) annihilation, is a good recent example.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? -- That is my biggest concern.
Update: I&#x27;m not as worried about Ilya et al as commercial companies (including formerly &quot;open&quot; OpenAI) discovering AGI.</span>

1. It gets added to a list of marketing website leads, which is owned by SDRs/BDRs who are there to filter and qualify leads. These are usually early-career people, with a base salary + quota for qualifying leads. The website is many times their least preferred channel of leads due to the quality, but they can&#x27;t ignore it because sometimes good customers do come through there.
2. The SDR will either work over email or on a call; their goal is to identify if you&#x27;re a real potential customer (vs shopping for prices, vs confused about what we sell), write up notes, and identify which customer segment you belo…</span>

                              <span>Maybe they have saved enough from working in tech that they can grow vegetables for themselves in a very low scale way. Its nice to escape from the career you&#x27;ve had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you&#x27;ve lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn&#x27;t that difficult. You certainly don&#x27;t need &quot;millions in equipment&quot;. Its exactly what I did.
I found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much &#x27;smaller&#x27; scale. My company is small and work demands don&#x27;t dominate my life. I have balance.
This year I&#x27;ve planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. &quot;touching grass&quot; is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens.</span>

If you&#x27;ve never worked on a farm and have some kind of romantic idea about it then you shouldn&#x27;t do this. Farming is hard work. Modern farmers have college degrees, millions in equipment, and a vast amount of knowledge and experience you do not have.
If you&#x27;re thinking of doing this and do not have experience go work on a farm for a year before you buy in.</span>

Also, it&#x27;s completely not obvious from your web pages which features already work in your OS. And, IMHO, Discord is definitely not &quot;the perfect place to connect, collaborate, and contribute&quot;.

                              <span>I like a lot of the answers, but something else I&#x27;d add: lots of &quot;popular&quot; architectures from the late 00s and early 2010s have fallen by the wayside because people realized &quot;You&#x27;re not Google. Your company will never be Google.&quot;
That is, there was a big desire around that time period to &quot;build it how the big successful companies built it.&quot; But since then, a lot of us have realized that complexity isn&#x27;t necessary for 99% of companies. When you couple that with hardware and standard databases getting much better, there are just fewer and fewer companies who need all of these &quot;scalability tricks&quot;.
My bar for &quot;Is there a reason we can&#x27;t just do this all in Postgres?&quot; is much, much higher than it was a decade ago.</span>

In case you didn&#x27;t know, I have a thing for photographing old school pay phones.


I also really happen to love typewriters.

Even if this funding is only sufficient to review a handful of papers each year, it stands to have a transformative effect on the level of hype and p-hacking in many fields, and could nearly eliminate the rare cases of actual fraud. It would also improve the overall quality and reliability of the literature too.</span>

 In issue 215 of Black Flag we ran a critique of the politics of Green Anarchist, “Irrationalism — Steve Booth Against the Machine”, which attacked propositions by Steve Booth (in Green Anarchist 51) in favour of “acts of intense violence against the system with no obvious motives, no pattern”. Booth stated that:

Title: My Own Pearl Harbor
Date: Dec 7, 2022
Source: medium.com/@danielmcgowannyc

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning. And like that, the past had caught up with…</span>

Date: Fall of 2011

 The award-winning documentary, If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front, premiered at Sundance last spring and continues to screen in theaters across the globe. The film, which aired on PBS earlier this fall and is now available on DVD, details the events that led to the imprisonment of environmental activist Daniel McGowan and raises critical questions about ecological crisis, terrorism, and government repression of political activists. 
 Those who see If A Tree Falls are likely to be left with a number of lingering questions. How is Daniel doing now? When will he be re…</span>

Title: Toby Shone and the spectre of ‘anarchist terror’
Date: May 9th, 2022

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides. 
Europe-wide crackdown

 This interview was carried out by a correspondent of Columna Negra after a gathering held in the city of Monza, Italy on the 24th-25th of November of the past year, a moment in which some discussions were carried out in respect to current repression world wide, the Mapuche situation amongst other topics. This first exchange of ideas with Alfredo Maria Bonanno turned into what you will read below.

1. PRELIMINARY NOTES
 The Houthis attacks on cargo ships, the USA/UK strikes against Yemen, the USA/EU naval fleet deployed in the Red Sea, the ISIS-K Crocus City Hall attack[1], the Iran/Israel missile attacks[2] constitute new expressions of the emerging global reality: competing groups/blocks of capitalists have chosen the route of war, in order to establish themselves in a better position within the hierarchies of a globalised economy that is in stagnation, and is also dealing with the exhausti…</span>

Nos piden desde el principio un régimen perfecto, garantía de que las cosas se harán así y no de este otro modo, sin coscorrones, sin tanteos. Si hubiéramos de aprender a vivirlo, no terminaríamos nunca el aprendizaje. Ni el niño aprendería a andar, ni el chico montaría en bicicleta, ni sería posible adquirir un oficio o una especialización. Al contrario, en la vida se hacen al revés las cosas.

Date: 2007
Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. 

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…</span>

                              <span>In our previous post, we documented the significant growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) over the past decade, but also argued for and showed evidence of NBFIs’ dependence on banks for funding and liquidity support. In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.</span>

Title: On Organization
Date: 1954
Notes: Translated from the Italian-language article in ‘L’Adunata dei Refrattari’, June 19, 1954, New York City and Newark. A partial English translation previously appeared in ‘Resistance: An Anarchist Bi-Monthly‘, August-October 1954, New York City, but this is a new and complete translation

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…</span>

Title: The Armed Nation
Date: 1902
Notes: Translated by Andrea Asali, from “‘La nazione armata,’” La Rivoluzione Sociale (London), no. 4 (November 15, 1902), published in ‘The Complete Works of Malatesta, Vol. V, The Armed Strike: The Long London Exile of 1900–13′ (2023), edited by Davide Turcato, who notes that &quot;In the debate on how the army should be structured, a debate that has accompanied the history of unified Italy, the &#x27;armed nation&#x27; was the model that federalist and democratic forces opposed to that of the permanent army at the sovereign’s service. Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…</span>

                              <span>“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they&#x27;re working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.
