Many of us might think this is a good idea since global warming poses a real threat to the planet. Unfortunately, the G-7  More

I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor...

                              <span>guyssssss... look at the blog!!!! we got a newsletter now! it&#x27;s just for me send out notifs about new blog posts and some other stuff, probably more personal stuff for my buddies :p also, check out the reply via email link at the ends of my posts.
I&#x27;ve been looking around this website as much as i can (very difficult btw) to find interesting blog layouts and generally read the room and determine the culture bearbloggers have going on here. I&#x27;ll be honest, and sorry to offend if I do, but this seems like a very serious website... imma keep doing what I do on here of course, but a lot of the posts I&#x27;ve read have a very sterile voice to them. I hope more friends come on here and we can liven up the space a bit more. let&#x27;s smile and laugh you guys &lt;3
I&#x27;m still enjoying many of the blogs on here, especially those ran by women. not to be reese witherspoon &quot;women&#x27;s stories matter. they just matter.&quot; but women&#x27;s stories really do matter and I really enjoy reading about other women&#x27;s lives on this website. blogging gives a space to introspect and reflect on our lives, and I enjoy hearing other women&#x27;s voices and beliefs. I&#x27;m hoping to hear more queer voices, too.
to my dear friends who actually read my blog, I hope you guys will come on here one day, too. I think you&#x27;re all so wonderful anyway, and I love to read more from you guys.
thank you to all the now-strangers that are also reading this blog, I really appreciate you and the grace you&#x27;ve given me to feel more welcomed on this website. if you like it here, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter &lt;3
love love love you guys! byeeee~

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

                              <span>I just want to say that this is really actually kind of mind-blowing from an audio engineering perspective.
Outputting audio from multiple laptops in the same room is easy. Perfectly syncing it is harder. Implementing echo cancellation across all of that is quite a bit trickier than regular single-device echo cancellation.
But then treating all the laptop microphones as a kind of microphone array, having to deal with sync issues and phase issues and background noise issues... that&#x27;s hard core.
Kudos to the engineering team on this one. This is actually pretty amazing.</span>

Zoom and Teams always frustrate me, even though they&#x27;re what I use far more often.
It&#x27;s too bad that video conferencing is largely a game of who has the most boxes checked - IT admins and A/V folk are the ones that need to be convinced, and Meet just doesn&#x27;t ...meet... their needs</span>

                              <span>As far as I can tell, the issue with this is:
OP runs a casino/gambling site.  Gambling is a regulatory mess (I have spent far too long dealing with this as an RNG supplier), and so it&#x27;s very hard to comply with every jurisdiction, and each one needs you to prove compliance to operate in that jurisdiction.*  Gaming companies spend a lot on compliance and tracking, but since the internet is the internet, it&#x27;s pretty hard to enforce perfectly, so some countries and ISPs take this into their own hands.
Due to that, IPs hosting gambling and gaming sites often get regionally blocked by internet providers or otherwise flagged as hosting illegal content.  Those regional blocks consequently affect the reputation score of the IP, and if you are a traffic aggregator like Cloudflare, can cause other customers to have issues.  One of the most aggressive and annoying regulatory environments for gambling companies is the US, so it&#x27;s very possible Cloudflare has had some trouble due to gambling use of their IPs in states in the USA.
Cloudflare wanted them to use the BYOIP features of the enterprise plan, and did not want them on Cloudflare&#x27;s IPs. The solution was to aggressively sell the Enterprise plan, and in a stunning failure of corporate communication, not tell the customer what the problem was at all.  The message from Cloudflare should have been &quot;Enterprise plan + BYOIP or ban, and maybe we&#x27;ll work with you on price&quot; but it was instead &quot;you would really like the Enterprise plan.&quot;
*As an aside - we&#x27;re lucky in that respect being a tech supplier with relatively uniform rules, but our customers (the gaming companies) get the short end of the stick here.</span>

                              <span>I have been hearing stories from developers/entrepeneurs about Cloudflare being very weird to deal with:
&quot;We&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enterprise plan.&quot;
&quot;No thanks, I&#x27;m fine with the free plan.&quot;
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enteprrise plan.&quot;
&quot;Is there a traffic limit on the free plan?&quot;
&quot;No, there is no limit. But based on your traffic, we require you to get an enteprirse plan.&quot;
[Gives up and gets an enterprise plan]
[6 months later]
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about up&#x27;ing your enteprise plan to a new monthly pay.&quot;
&quot;Is there a cap to traffic in our current plan? I don&#x27;t see that in our terms.&quot;
&quot;No, there is no cap to traffic in cloudflare plans, but based on your traffic, we&#x27;re going to require you to pay more per month than you are currently paying.&quot;
&quot;OK, can you tell me the traffic limit in our current or new plan? So I know what I&#x27;m paying for and when I&#x27;m approaching it?&quot;
&quot;No. But you need to pay more.&quot;
[Wash, rinse, repeat, every 6-12 months]
It seems like while cloudflare technically does not charge for egress, in fact for large egress it&#x27;s just a game of chicken between the customer and a salesperson every 6-12 months, with the salesperson trying to figure out the most they can manage to get without losing the customer? I mean, I guess that is standard for enteprise sales, but I think usually you at least have some terms to know what you&#x27;ve got for how long without a renegotiation?</span>

If people are going to treat these things like they are forensic evidence and not lead generation, then they shouldn&#x27;t be legal. Some precedent that people need to check these things before acting on them would be very good.</span>

As always when a representative of the right wing tells you he or she is campaigning to bring “freedom,” be afraid. Very afraid. For “freedom” in these cases means freedom for the richest financiers and industrialists to do whatever they want.
For them, “Freedom” is for capital, not for human beings without capital to invest. Today’s exhibit is the offensive against working people that is taking place in Argentina, where the new extreme right president, Javier Milei, is determined to see how far capitalist ideology can be pushed. So far, Argentines have pushed back but Milei, cheered on by domestic and international big business leaders, is nothing if not determined to ram through his austerity packages. And he has shown no inclination to allow mere democracy to stand in his way.
Nonetheless, there is no surprise here. President Milei ran on a program of extreme austerity, brandishing a chainsaw at his election rallies. Unfortunately, enough Argentines bought his siren songs, or were desperate enough to try anything given the country’s punishing inflation, to elect him, ending a one-term period in executive office by the ordinarily dominant Peronists. Alas, doing something new for the sake of doing something new, when it is aimed at you, rarely works. And here there is actually nothing new. President Milei simply promoted standard hard right ideology, albeit promoting it with unusual vigor. Snake oil is snake oil, as Argentine working people are already finding out.

From The New York Post to The Wall Street Journal, right-wing pundits have lined up to malign students across the United States who have rightfully criticized their schools for supporting the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza. As the genocide continues to unfold — claiming the lives of 35,562 Palestinians, including 15,000 children, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing — students, faculty and staff have brought overdue scrutiny to the complicity of their universities, whose endowments are altogether valued at more than $839 billion per the National Association of College and University Business Officers and invested extensively in the Israeli economy, including weapons manufacturers profiting directly from Palestinian death. Rather than accept that students oppose their tuition dollars being spent to kill Palestinians, right-wing pundits have instead accused them of being “paid protesters” in the employ of philanthropist George Soros.

She told us growing up in the old days they didn&#x27;t had specialized schools for deaf people (since they could read?!) so she attended regular school and was not doing ok. She struggled a lot until she finally got the attention that she needed from a teacher who was able to instruct her in sign language (which believe you or not is Brazil&#x27;s second official language). Before that she told us she was not able to have complex thoughts. She didn&#x27;t know her father had a name, for instance. She thought his &quot;name&quot; was daddy. She is a brilliant woman and I&#x27;m glad I attended her class and also, that she was able to find someone who helped her, growing up.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40478558">

                              <span>Short explanation:
1. The largest power of 2 that divides x is just 2^(number of trailing zeros in x)
2. Crucial observation: -x &#x3D;&#x3D; ~x + 1
3. ~x flips all the bits of x bits, so none of the bits of ~x match those of x. (i.e. (x &amp; ~x) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
4. When you do +1, all the trailing 1&#x27;s flip AGAIN, becoming zero like they were in x. The next highest 0 (say it was the n&#x27;th) also flips, becoming 1... like it was in x.
5. Crucial observation: The n&#x27;th 0 did NOT match the corresponding bit in x prior to the increment, therefore it MUST match after the increment. All higher bits stay as-is.
6. This leaves only the n&#x27;th bits matching in x and ~x + 1, isolating the highest power-of-2 divisor of x when you AND them.</span>

                              <span>This approach to remove bad search suggestions manually reminded of a different approach Google once took, where they weren’t satisfied with manually tweaking search results but rather wanted to tweak the algorithm that produces these results when there were bad results.
&#x27;Around 2002, a team was testing a subset of search limited to products, called Froogle. But one problem was so glaring that the team wasn&#x27;t comfortable releasing Froogle: when the query &quot;running shoes&quot; was typed in, the top result was a garden gnome sculpture that happened to be wearing sneakers. Every day engineers would try to tweak the algorithm so that it would be able to distinguish between lawn art and footwear, but the gnome kept its top position. One day, seemingly miraculously, the gnome disappeared from the results. At a meeting, no one on the team claimed credit. Then an engineer arrived late, holding an elf with running shoes. He had bought the one-of-a kind product from the vendor, and since it was no longer for sale, it was no longer in the index. &quot;The algorithm was now returning the right results,&quot; says a Google engineer. &quot;We didn&#x27;t cheat, we didn&#x27;t change anything, and we launched.&quot;&#x27;

                              <span>I feel like &quot;parsing each keystroke twice&quot; is pretty low on the list of things that wastes CPU cycles and drains my laptop battery. I cannot at all get worked up over this, getting to the point I&#x27;d pull out the word &quot;poison&quot; to describe it.
It&#x27;s nice that Kitty does most of what tmux does built in, but as the author points out, that&#x27;s not really all that helpful for anyone who does any work over ssh.
And to me, bundling all that into a terminal emulator is bloat. Terminals should be terminals. If I want a multiplexer on top of that, I will... use a multiplexer on top of that.
I am potentially sympathetic to the idea that tmux and screen make it harder for terminal developers to add new features to their terminals. I don&#x27;t really know enough about the issues involved to form an opinion. But from the perspective of a regular user, I do not want a multiplexer in my terminal app. When I need one, I prefer to reach for an app-agnostic multiplexer like tmux or screen.</span>

                              <span>I feel like there&#x27;s some semantic slippage around the meaning of the word &quot;accuracy&quot; here.
I grant you, my print Encyclopedia Britannica is not 100% accurate. But the difference between it and a LLM is not just a matter of degree: there&#x27;s a &quot;chain of custody&quot; to  information that just isn&#x27;t there with a LLM.
Philosophers have a working definition of knowledge as being (at least†) &quot;justified true belief.&quot;
Even if a LLM is right most of the time and yields &quot;true belief&quot;, it&#x27;s not justified belief and therefore cannot yield knowledge at all.
Knowledge is Google&#x27;s raison d&#x27;etre and they have no business using it unless they can solve or work around this problem.
† Yes, I know about the Gettier problem, but is not relevant to the point I&#x27;m making here.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40475765">

                              <span>I think this is really a spectrum and they are focusing on some more extreme aspects of it. But it is definitely not just an Asian thing and I believe to some degree this type of social withdrawal has affected perhaps a very significant portion of our society.
I have definitely been socially isolated my entire life to some degree or another. But much more so in adulthood. Again, I suggest that this is relatively common, not something that happens to only a few million people.
One aspect that is being glossed over is the amount of socialization or let&#x27;s call it &quot;pseudo-social&quot; activity that is happening over the internet for these people.
I&#x27;m someone who generally does not have friends, leaves the apartment literally only a handful of times per month to take the garbage out and maybe buy groceries once or twice a month if I am trying to save money versus Instacart.
For me it comes down to money. I have a health issue that makes me fatigued etc. and don&#x27;t have money for health insurance. I don&#x27;t have money to go to restaurants or otherwise waste going out. So I stay home.
Because I&#x27;m always in a poor health and financial state, I feel uncomfortable trying to do any &quot;real&quot; socialization.
But I have always been trying one way or another to get to a point where I have a &quot;real&quot; online business that allows me to actually thrive. Such as buying a car and a house, getting health insurance and addressing my health issues, or paying taxes.
But what I have managed so far is usually just enough to scrape by. There have been some minor successes here and there but rarely have I ever felt like I had enough to truly meet my basic needs such as the health concerns or financial stability.
Anyway, I think it&#x27;s easy to get in a position with health and financial challenges, maybe just a series of low-paying contracts, where some degree of social isolation is just practical and realistic.</span>

This is especially true for services that have other important uses besides file hosting and hence are hard to block.
This already happened to Twitter[1], Telegram[2], and even the PGP key infrastructure[3], not to mention obvious suspects like GitHub.

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>

hacks? Don&#x27;t tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.
First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>

                              <span>This was the week of rebukes for Israel: On Monday, the ICC requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, on Wednesday three European nations, Ireland, Spain and Norway, recognized Palestinian statehood and on Friday the ICJ ordered Israel to halt its military operations in Rafah, open the border crossings for humanitarian aid and allow international investigators into Gaza. Has the international community finally run out of patience with Israeli intransigence?

I got incredibly lucky in my spring semester of last year, my first semester of college as a whole, to have very nice professors and cool classmates. I especially lucked out with my public speaking class, in which I made two new friends. we haven&#x27;t had any more classes together since, but we still hang out at least once or twice a month.
it&#x27;s funny because the first friend I made was because she heard me say my birthday and her birthday is the day after mine. we then exclaimed, chatted a bit more about what we have in common, and we figured out that her brother is dating one of my friends from high school.
the second friend came about because she started talking to the …</span>

                              <span>Convictions are important in life. If you don&#x27;t have strong convictions you will find yourself going wherever the next opinionated and charismatic person you meet points you.  But it is important to choose them wisely.
What if your conviction is that penguins can fly, they only need the right motivation? So you spend your life trying to give motivational speeches to penguins. Hoping one of them will fly. You will even meet people with similarly strong convictions. Form a strong community. Make derogatory memes about the &#x27;others&#x27; who believe in things like the &#x27;scientific method&#x27; and so on.
And your ego attaches itself tightly to your penguin motivator persona. So anyone trying to challenge you is attacking you and your community. So you viciously attack this person back. Congratulations. You are now in a toxic pointless echo chamber.
The only solution is selecting convictions using first principles. Employ the scientific method. Be open to being challenged as long as the challenge comes through solid first principles thinking as well. All the while keeping the ego in check.
So in essence develop an egoless conviction. Be open to being challenged. Don&#x27;t end up in pointless toxic echo chambers.</span>

when you have a neighborhood place, somewhere that&#x27;s been a cornerstone of your community, it is like heartbreak to see it close. The Press in Claremont, California is, and has, been my favorite restaurant for years. it&#x27;s where my family would go to eat before I was born, where my teenage cousin revealed to them that she was pregnant with my cousins, where my parents would go on date nights before I came around. and now it&#x27;s gone.
they closed it in 2020 with lockdown, and their website has said they were coming back soon for months, for years. I&#x27;m watching the bear
and sydney&#x27;s risotto is a dish they would&#x27;ve had as a special and I&#x27;m thinking of them. I&#x27;m thinking …</span>

                              <span>You may have noticed a proliferation of a new essayist archetype on the internet in recent years - the &quot;Mini Navals.&quot; Modeled after angel investor, entrepreneur, and philosopher Naval Ravikant, these mini me&#x27;s desperately want to become the next big thought leader by aping Naval&#x27;s pithy, maxim-filled style. Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress &quot;wisdom&quot; into a handful of tweets and blog posts.
Most Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval&#x27;s entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it&#x27;s usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.
Sometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don&#x27;t need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.</span>

                              <span>I will forever treasure my ICQ memories.
The sounds it made. The moving image when it was connecting. Listening in Winamp to one of only a few dozen possible songs that I had carefully downloaded.
Being able to randomly connect to people you would filter. Yes, I want to talk to someone more or less my age but in Iceland. Or any other country.
But most of all, the feeling of being connected. As a teenager in the autism spectrum, that was one of the best feelings I had at that time.
Most people don’t get it when I say this, maybe someone here will, but to me it all started going downhill when people all of a sudden switched to a worse alternative, MSN. I see a direct line from there to the annoying easy-to-accept-while-hard-to-reject-but-always-there-anyway cookie pop-ups.
And no, this is isn’t some form of Ostalgie where we long for past days of hardship with tender feelings. ICQ just had a great user experience as far as I am concerned and to this day I prefer it to existing alternatives from WhatsApp to Webex chat (don’t mention Teams please, I’m having a poetic moment). It was rather a feeling that perhaps other Brazilians will share: a longing, saudade, for the simpler (yes) but better and more poetic 90s, when ICQ connected you to a world that watched Brazil win the fourth World Cup, Ayrton Senna was inspiring generations to be healthier and their better selves and Mamonas Assassinas could only make us laugh, not cry…
So long, ICQ. You will always be part of why I love the internet.
PS: I realize the timing of those events doesn’t necessarily align. But sentimentally they do.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40470453">

                              <span>Given the level of impact that this incident caused, I am surprised that the remediations did not go deeper. They ensured that the same problem could not happen again in the same way, but that&#x27;s all. So some equivalent glitch somewhere down the road could lead to a similar result (or worse; not all customers might have the same &quot;robust and resilient architectural approach to managing risk of outage or failure&quot;).
Examples of things they could have done to systematically guard against inappropriate service termination / deletion in the future:
1. When terminating a service, temporarily place it in a state where the service is unavailable but all data is retained and can be restored at the push of a button. Discard the data after a few days. This provides an opportunity for the customer to report the problem.
2. Audit all deletion workflows for all services (they only mention having reviewed GCVE). Ensure that customers are notified in advance whenever any service is terminated, even if &quot;the deletion was triggered as a result of a parameter being left blank by Google operators using the internal tool&quot;.
3. Add manual review for any termination of a service that is in active use, above a certain size.
Absent these broader measures, I don&#x27;t find this postmortem to be in the slightest bit reassuring. Given the are-you-f*ing-kidding-me nature of the incident, I would have expected any sensible provider who takes the slightest pride in their service, or even is merely interested in protecting their reputation, to visibly go over the top in ensuring nothing like this could happen again. Instead, they&#x27;ve done the bare minimum. That says something bad about the culture at Google Cloud.</span>

My workflow back in the day was mainly thrift store CD to AudioGrabber. I still have a few CDs that only exist in high-bitrate MP3 format after losing the physical disk.
Lately I&#x27;ve been using MusicBrainz Picard to re-organize all of these ancient rips and then automedia to add parity. I&#x27;m still paranoid that Spotify will disappear one day and I&#x27;m afraid to lose my older music collection.</span>

  This figure compares the prediction performance of GPT and quantitative models based on machine learning. Stepwise Logistic follows Ou and Penman (1989)’s structure with their 59 financial predictors. ANN is a three-layer artificial neural network model using the same set of variables as in Ou and Penman (1989). GPT (with CoT) provides the model with financial statement information and detailed chain-of-thought prompts. We report average accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions) for each method (left) and F1 score (right). We obtain bootstrapped standard errors by randomly sampling 1,000 observations 1,000 times and include 95% confidence intervals.</span>

                              <span>This is really a nice product, but I won&#x27;t order it unless SolOS and its firmware and drivers are open sourced.
I&#x27;ve probably spent far more than 8000 bucks over the years for devices like this, only to have to throw them away eventually because their software got abandoned and they&#x27;ve been so proprietary that they can only function as an expensive brick on the shelf.
If the software is closed source, I&#x27;d recommend everyone to stay away from any product like this. It is a deal breaker for me now, and it took a lot of cash and hype to realize it.
Products like this are not a mainstream product, which makes them high risk for their investors. And you have to minimize risk by demanding open source.</span>

                              <span>As a hardware engineer:
Right to repair is a nice idea and it&#x27;s heart is in the right place, but won&#x27;t ever work for something like a consumer phone. Further, IMO, it&#x27;s really just a band aid for the US&#x27;s extremely poor consumer protections which manufacturers are hell bent on exporting to the rest of the world.
The most effective way to approach this problem is known and proven: mandate long (I think 5 years is fair) 100% repair/replace/refund waranty periods with no cost to the consumer (including shipping).
Then the manufacturer themselves will figure out the details on how to meet that. And don&#x27;t worry they are perfectly capable of it because it&#x27;s what they do RIGHT NOW.
The hardware will become more reliable or it&#x27;ll be repairable or they&#x27;ll just refund you or a combination of those.
Batteries just need a requirement such as minimum 80% of capacity at 5 years. Overnight they&#x27;ll become replacable/over-provisioned/better chemistry/better thermals or again a combination of those.
I&#x27;ve never had &quot;repairability&quot; raised to me as an engineer. It&#x27;s a nebulous thing nobody understands or cares about and can be just paid lip service to or effectively ignored. But waranty IS something bean-counters and managers understand. It&#x27;s: &quot;this thing must work for X time or it costs us money&quot; with the added threat of &quot;lawyers might get involved&quot;.
It&#x27;s not perfect, but still far more effective and practical than &quot;right to repair&quot;.</span>

If I could just plug this in to my existing laptop and use it for reading specs, technical docs, …etc that would be amazing.
Android tablet is a tough sell for my employer due to compliance, security, and such.  So buying one of those for work use would take like a year minimum gathering all the necessary approvals and likely would still get denied by someone.  But, a dumb monitor with no real OS I can expense that without approval.  just a heads up to my boss really to say I am buying this and here is why.
I know you are a small company so have to pick your battles.  But, maybe something to consider down the road.
EDIt: forgot to say, congrats on the launch.  Looks like a great product.</span>

                              <span>As one of the beta testers, let me just say that I really like this device. It&#x27;s very different than a kindle, kobo or reMarkable in that the refresh rate really makes a big difference. When I show this device to people, I show them how quickly zooming in on a PDF is. It&#x27;s way faster and more responsive than any e-ink screen and it&#x27;s way less addicting than the typical laptop, phone or tablet.
I&#x27;m attempting to make this device my main driver over the next few months and while the ecosystem isn&#x27;t exactly mature yet, most android apps just work out of the box and I&#x27;ve found myself doing a lot more reading, either through an e-reading app (Lithium), PDF reader or Instapaper. I have X, Primal, Telegram and many other apps installed, but I don&#x27;t go to them nearly as much. The device really is a lot more human centered and it makes for a much more intentional device.</span>

Some of the data pins on its USB port wore out, so my Android Auto and fast charging became extremely flaky. It was still under warranty so I took it to their authorized repair centres. They did not have a fast charger and showed me that the standard charging was working, and refused to admit a problem. Finally I mailed it to Samsung, and they said that the display needed to be replaced because of some water damage (it worked perfectly fine!) as well.
Finally I got some local electronics repair guy to just solder a new USB port onto the circuit board and that fixed everything. But never buying their phones again.</span>

                              <span>This past Saturday, my little family and I went to Den Haag to vote in the 2024 South African National Election. An experience that has stayed with me all week, eventually morphing into this post.
We arrived at the embassy at 11:00, expecting to be there no more than two hours. Truthfully, we really weren’t prepared for what awaited us.
A common joke (read truthism) among expats is that it’s incredibly easy to identify a South African embassy as it’s generally the only embassy with burglar bars, uncut grass and a queue outside. Walking through the doors of a South African embassy is like walking through a portal linked directly to The Department of Home Affairs in Bellville. It&#x27;s quite a surreal experience actually.
The queue on Saturday was something else. It wrapped around several blocks…</span>

                              <span>Some photographs from the Chinese city of 沈阳 (Shenyang).

I could spend all day browsing these five-story malls. This one boasted restaurants, cafes, daycares, basketball courts, go-karting, and live fish.

Fine dining in 沈阳. These are the food models in the lobby. Outside the frame, my mom is fighting with my aunt and uncle-in-law first to pay the bill, and when she loses that battle, to order fewer items. Lots of 客气 to go around. 

Although it may look the part, those flowers are not lavender. You can&#x27;t see it here, but the whole time we were in Shenyang it looked as though it were snowing. I later learned that the &quot;snow&quot; was actually the seed hairs of the willow and the poplar trees. It looks cool until the fuzz gets in your eyes, on your clothes, everywhere. (source)
老北市
A popular night market in 沈阳 which runs every night. If you&#x27;re there at the right time, you can catch the show with flying drone-powered phoenixes shooting fireworks from their wings. Sadly I don&#x27;t have any good photos of that show — my senses were overwhelmed for most of the night (in a good way).










Night markets have been ruined for me forever. How can anything measure up to that? Not to mention we passed two markets en route to 老北市 that also looked better than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.</span>

                              <span>The term skill issue is thrown around Twitter a lot. It comes from gaming culture. If you can&#x27;t beat a level. It is a skill issue. Just level up and win. If you think about it, it is a powerful term. It gives power to the player.
Applied to life everything is a skill issue. Can&#x27;t do the perfect juggle? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t write awesome distributed performant code? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t convince a penguin to try your awesome new ice cream? You guessed it. Skill issue. It is a powerful mindset. Gives you extreme ownership.
But there is a catch. Do you take ownership of other people&#x27;s shitty behavior? No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don&#x27;t need the negativity in your life.
Here the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context. In a more personal context, things are a lot more messy. I don&#x27;t have an answer for that which works. A skill issue on my end. Need more life experience to resolve it.
Make everything a skill issue and just level up!</span>

                              <span>In the world of frontend development, one thing remains certain: change is the only constant. New frameworks emerge, and libraries can become obsolete without warning. Keeping up with the ever-changing ecosystem involves handling code conversions, both big and small. One significant shift for us was the transition from Enzyme to React Testing Library (RTL), prompting […]

In a previous Liberty Street Economics post, we have shown that even relative to a group of comparable non-veterans, veterans have lower employment and labor force participation rates. One year later, we see that veterans continue to experience lower labor market attachment and the employment gap has widened, though the earnings gap has closed.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these (...)

                              <span>In the fall, I&#x27;ll be moving to a new city to pursue graduate studies. I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.
Next week I&#x27;m flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it&#x27;ll be just me, in a new city. I&#x27;m excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I&#x27;m really on my own.
I moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it&#x27;s time for me to leave; I&#x27;ve been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I&#x27;m in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).
It&#x27;s a big step, despite something I&#x27;m excited for. Yet very scary. But if I&#x27;m scared to do it, it&#x27;s exactly because I&#x27;m scared that I should do it.
I think I&#x27;m ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.
The (paper) journal I&#x27;ve kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It&#x27;s as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.
I&#x27;ll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?</span>

                              <span>The fundamental selling point of all productivity advice is getting more done in less time. It&#x27;s a good hook. I have over the years consumed a lot of content around productivity. It took me a long time to realise I was making a fundamental mistake.
I assumed I would stumble upon some specific protocol that I can follow perfectly and my life is set. So I have tried it all. All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.
The fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.
This realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.
How to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming. I have given a framework I follow for this in my &#x27;Hacking Hardwork&#x27; post.
There is no golden technique that will save you. Only you can save yourself.</span>

                              <span>People that use mouth dildos annoy the shit out of me. Either commit and smoke a cigarette, or give it up.
I hate smoking. I think it&#x27;s fucking disgusting and I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to do it. I especially hate it when there&#x27;s a gaggle of smokers huddled around the front door of a pub, tooting away on their fags. It&#x27;s vile and I don&#x27;t want my pink fluffy lungs affected by that shit.
But do you know what I hate more than smoking?
Mouth dildos.
What the fuck is a mouth dildo?
-- Everyone
This is a mouth dildo:

Not only do you look ridiculous putting that stupid fucking contraption in your mouth, but the plumes of flavoured vapour that bellow from these things make you look even more like an utter cunt.
I don&#x27;t want to be subjected to the cherry ice cream vapour pouring from your mouth dildos, seemingly by the bucket load. At least smokers are committing, knowing they&#x27;re gonna kill themselves, have decided to enjoy it while they&#x27;re here.
But you mouth dildo fuckers are the worst. We don&#x27;t want to smell your stupid fucking vape. So put it away because you look (and smell) like a dick head.
Peace ✌🏻

While we usually think of their ability to borrow as determined by aggregate credit conditions, in reality firms have a number of markets where they can borrow, and conditions can vary across those markets. In this post, we investigate how the composition of debt instruments on U.S. firms’ balance sheets has evolved over the last twenty years.</span>
