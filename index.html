Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x &#x3D; 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is &quot;dimensionless&quot; i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

                              <span>A company that provides a phone service (mobile or other) has to conform to a large amount of regulatory red tape. Why? because either a company before tried to monopolise the entire country, or they killed someone.
Now, large tech companies haven&#x27;t wholesale killed people (unlike say tobacco, or talc powder, 3M and half of their solvents, weed killer, most car makers, etc etc)
but they have been trying desperately to stop all competition.
They&#x27;ve also been trying to extract as much personal info as possible for profit. Because regulators in the USA are hamstrung, they are used to being able to basically doing stuff that would be illegal if it were in physical stores/pre-existing industries.</span>

                              <span>The city of Cracow in Poland banned billboards (and other visual advertising quite aggressively) about 2 years ago. Great outcomes. There are still some workarounds that companies do to put this s..t out in the public (e.g. covers of renovation works can contain up to 50% of advertising area, so we have renovations of just finished buildings only to put the covers with ads). 
Now, when I visit another city when there&#x27;s no such ban I cannot stand this visual garbage.
This should be banned everywhere.</span>

                              <span>And so, it came to pass …
We recently bought a new, shiny iMac from our local Apple store. But what you don’t know is why. It wasn’t because we’re rich and thought, ‘hey, let’s own two iMacs!’
We bought the new one because Houston, our stalwart workhorse for the last 10 years (yes, we’ve had him since early 2009) was beginning to show his age, and to our ears, complaining of said age. He was getting forgetful too. Which made us both very nervous, I can tell you. The odd and slightly disturbing noises were the worst.
His hard drive was sounding odd … wonky. Like his once valiant heart was given out from too many revs. His Brian slowly fragmenting so that collating saved data was becoming a strain.
All this after doing our best to always run the right programs to keep his HD in good working order. But, alas, time took its toll.
Sometime, over night between Thursday and Friday morning, Houston passed away quietly, in his sleep.
We’ve done everything in our power this morning to revive him. Went through every available trouble shooting article we could find to find a solution. Nothing worked. Houston’s HD, the heart of the machine he is, was, could not be revived let alone accessed.
That magical sound of him waking every morning is now muted and gone forever.
Salut Houston, you served us well.

To keep myself organised and, because I love paper and all things stationery, I&#x27;ve been a journalist all my life. From writing in little spiral-bound notebooks and school exercise books as a child, right on through to a fancy leather-bound Midori (an expensive Japanese notebook) that was a birthday gift. I&#x27;ve been an avid note-maker since I was able to hold a pencil and write.
I&#x27;ve used all sorts of notebooks to scribble in, and even tried the made for journaling journal by Baron Fig—yes, what a great name! Never mind the journal that everyone seems to hold as sacred, the Leuchtturm1917. But amongst them all, big, small, ruled, dotted or blank, fancy, plain, expensive or…</span>

                              <span>I spent the morning making some drawings for my summer art project. Four of them are done and on their way to their forever homes to be read and tucked away in books, to be pinned on a fridge or placed on a shelf perhaps. Tiny paper notes traveling across the globe.

finished postcards...can you guess which one is yours?
Thinking about the passage of time and trying not to spiral about the end of summer and the reality of finding work again. Can time not slow down? Will I be able to find work that doesn&#x27;t make me want to unalive myself?

Things Seen by Annie Ernaux
my fanciful summer wishlist:
reading print magazines/books
sending handwritten postcards and letters
handmade bed quilt &gt; duvet
playing cards by candlelight
more candles and boxes of matches
going to a drive-in (i&#x27;ve never been)…</span>

                              <span>Personally, I like how HN focuses on content and discussions rather than individual users. If I wanted to follow experts, I&#x27;d probably curate a selection on a social network like Mastodon, or kludge together some RSS feeds.
Also, I feel like this tool selects for active commenters, not for knowledgeable experts. Not to mention throwaway accounts.
Still a cool project.</span>

&gt; First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand.
The non-geometry problems which were solved were all of the form &quot;Determine all X such that…&quot;, and the resulting theorem statements are all of the form &quot;We show that the set of all X is {foo}&quot;. The downloadable solutions from https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B... don&#x27;t make it clear whether the set {foo} was decided by a human during this translation step, or whether the computer found it. I want to believe that the computer found it, but I can&#x27;t find anything to confirm. Anyone know?</span>

                              <span>So you’re setting up a multi-region RDS. If region A goes down, do you continue to accept writes to region B?
A bank: No! If region A goes down, do not process updates in B until A is back up! We’d rather be down than wrong!
A web forum: Yes! We can reconcile later when A comes back up. Until then keep serving traffic!
CAP theorem doesn’t let you treat the cloud as a magic infinite availability box. You still have to design your system to pick the appropriate behavior when something breaks. No one without deep insight into your business needs can decide for you, either. You’re on the hook for choosing.</span>

The US cultural bias is showing here, as it&#x27;s assumed that profit is above all else, and a company that forgoes profit to make workers happier must thus be less good.
The vast majority of people in companies are workers. Let&#x27;s stop optimizing for owner wealth and start optimizing for worker happiness instead.</span>

                              <span>Employee stock options are not a new idea, obviously.
If the story is &quot;every company should offer stock options to its employees&quot;, then sure, that&#x27;s often a good business plan. The reason not every company does it to all its employees is probably that for those employees, it wouldn&#x27;t affect incentives much and it would make payment subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day.
If the story is &quot;it should be the law that every company offers stock options&quot;, then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above.
If the story is &quot;all companies must be fully employee-owned workers&#x27; cooperatives&quot;, then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers&#x27; rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can&#x27;t sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There&#x27;s a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won&#x27;t sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers&#x27; stake.</span>

                              <span>One thing to note is that it is impossible to strip types from TypeScript without a grammar of TypeScript. Stripping types is not a token-level operation, and the TypeScript grammar is changing all the time.
Consider for example: &#x60;foo  ( x )&#x60;. In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo (x)) because bar&amp;baz wasn’t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I’m going back in time here but it’s a nice simple example.
If you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date. For people who like to stick on node LTS releases this may be an unacceptable compromise.</span>

                              <span>Like many people, my view of birdwatching (&quot;birding&quot;) and its practitioners were neutral at best, holding their stereotypical focal gear, donning vests and hats.
I learned that my friend casually did it on his walks and stuff, and was able to identify birds. That was cool, and made the hobby a bit more approachable for me.
It wasn&#x27;t until COVID when I saw a pair of cute yellow birds in the tree. Because the leaves haven&#x27;t grown in yet, I was able to watch them fly around the tree, landing in different spots, and ultimately move on to other spots. I was so mesmerized, I thought I had just seen a legendary pokemon. I immediately went to google, and found that it was an American Goldfinch.
It wasn&#x27;t really easy to find though. Google took me down an old-web looking site with the title &quot;Birds …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling rather listless about coding recently. I briefly tried some things on a sideproject website of mine to get back into it, and it was like pulling teeth. I haven&#x27;t properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there&#x27;s more to it.
I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…</span>

                              <span>This a million times.
I swear I will never understand why Amazon&#x27;s supply, organization, and pricing for household goods is such a disaster.
Because their experience for mainstream books is mostly perfectly fine -- there&#x27;s a single listing for each book, and the price doesn&#x27;t change much, just some discount from list. It works.
But for things like paper towels or Tide or whatever, it&#x27;s utter chaos. Multiple listings for the same item, sizes and quantities that mysteriously move from one listing to another, prices that vary 10x or more...
It&#x27;s utterly baffling to me why Amazon created this consumer-hostile nightmare. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, but everything home and toiletries I buy from Target online, simply because the listings and prices are totally consistent. Even though I have Prime! I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon doesn&#x27;t figure out that Prime consumers like me buy from Target instead because Amazon&#x27;s household supplies listings are such utter unpredictable garbage, while Target just works like a normal store.</span>

It&#x27;s disappointing to see GitHub calling it a feature instead of a bug, to me it just shows a complete lack of care about security. Privacy features should _always_ have a strict, safe default.
In the meantime I&#x27;ll be calling &quot;private&quot; repos &quot;unlisted&quot;, seems more appropriate</span>

                              <span>I reported this on their HackerOne many years ago (2018 it seems) and they said it was working as intended. Conclusion: don&#x27;t use private forks. Copy the repository instead.
Here is their full response from back then:
&gt; Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the finding we have determined it is a known low risk issue. We may make this functionality more strict in the future, but don&#x27;t have anything to announce now. As a result, this is not eligible for reward under the Bug Bounty program.
&gt; GitHub stores the parent repository along with forks in a &quot;repository network&quot;. It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository&#x27;s visibility changes (Eg. public-&gt;private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits/blobs from being readable via another network member.</span>

This is compounded by the multi-headed monster that large orgs like theirs have no choice but to become. If customers could trust that every day essentials had a relatively stable price and availability pattern like they trust from their local grocery store (rightly or wrongly), blind ordering might be more tenable.
But some other head on the beast wants to keep Amazon shaped like an unmonitored digital marketplace where orders are fulfilled dynamically by bidders and algorithms, so your Tide Pods could be anywhere from $6.99 to $64.99, and you might get anywhere between 10 and 100, and they might arrive tomorrow or next week, and they might come in retail packaging or as a bag of tide-pod-resembling-mystery-objects, etc.
Of course blind ordering won&#x27;t work when you can&#x27;t give your customers any  assurances (let alone guarantees) about price, quality, volume, etc</span>

                              <span>The core issue is that Amazon envisioned Alexa as a product that would help it increase sales. Smart home features were always an afterthought. How convenient would it be if people could shout &quot;Alexa order me Tide Pods&quot; from wherever they were in their home and the order got magically processed? That demo definitely got applause from a boardroom full of execs.
The problem is that consumers don&#x27;t behave like that. This is also why Amazon&#x27;s Dash buttons failed. I always want to see a page with the product details and price before I click &quot;buy&quot;. Reducing the number of clicks is not going to make me change my decision and suddenly order more things.
If they want to salvage Alexa, they need to forget shopping and start doubling down on the smart home and assistant experience. The tech is still pretty much where it was in 2014. Alexa can set timers and tell me the weather, and...that&#x27;s basically it. Make it a value add in my life and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a subscription fee for it.</span>

Our editor-in-chief was interviewed for this related Nature article a couple months ago (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7).
While it’s easy pickings, it’s still always worth pointing out the hypocrisy of Nature publishing pieces like this, given that they are key drivers of this phenomenon by rarely publishing null results in their mainline journals. They are have extremely little incentive to change anything about the way scientific publishing works, as they are currently profiting the most from the existing structures, so them publishing something like this always leaves a bit of a sour taste.</span>

                              <span>I opted out at Boston International Airport. It involved arguing with the TSA for about 5 minutes while holding up a 150 person line. Then the supervisor came over, told me that I &quot;was required to have to have my photo taken&quot; and opting out consisted of checking a box in the software to not save my photo. My alternative was to not get on the flight.
The whole idea of opting out is a scam. They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public.</span>

                              <span>&gt; We’re releasing Llama 3.1 405B, the first frontier-level open source AI model, as well as new and improved Llama 3.1 70B and 8B models.
Bravo! While I don&#x27;t agree with Zuck&#x27;s views and actions on many fronts, on this occasion I think he and the AI folks at Meta deserve our praise and gratitude. With this release, they have brought the cost of pretraining a frontier 400B+ parameter model to ZERO for pretty much everyone -- well, everyone except Meta&#x27;s key competitors.[a] THANK YOU ZUCK.
Meanwhile, the business-minded people at Meta surely won&#x27;t mind if the release of these frontier models to the public happens to completely mess up the AI plans of competitors like OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, etc. Come to think of it, the negative impact on such competitors was likely a key motivation for releasing the new models.

I find the language around &quot;open source AI&quot; to be confusing. With &quot;open source&quot; there&#x27;s usually &quot;source&quot; to open, right? As in, there is human legible code that can be read and modified by the user? If so, then how can current ML models be open source? They&#x27;re very large matrices that are, for the most part, inscrutable to the user. They seem akin to binaries, which, yes, can be modified by the user, but are extremely obscured to the user, and require enormous effort to understand and effectively modify.
&quot;Open source&quot; code is not just code that isn&#x27;t executed remotely over an API, and it seems like maybe its being conflated with that here?</span>

Six of them are still in operation today, manufacturing structural parts for military and commercial aircraft” [1].
$279mm in 1957 dollars is about $3.2bn today [2]. A public cluster of GPUs provided for free to American universities, companies and non-profits might not be a bad idea.

Because the stress and risks of running a small business as a solo inexperienced first time business owner are insane compared to a regular 9-5.
Especially if you start hiring other people, your liability then  increases 10 fold as now anything can happen with them (sick leave, absenteism, low performance, sabotage, etc) but you&#x27;re still bound to the same deadlines you agreed with your customers or you&#x27;ll get sued for damages by them.
As an employee you have some basic rights and protections from the state on the limits your employer can squeeze from you, more or less, depending on where you live. As a contractor or company however, you don&#x27;t, and can be fully liable in court for your failures to deliver regardless of your personal circumstances. Unless you know what you&#x27;re getting into and have the know-how, experience, or mentorship, it&#x27;s not worth it in most cases.</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn&#x27;t gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I&#x27;m so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

                              <span>I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I&#x27;d make my own version of it
Here&#x27;s my anti-resume,
I don&#x27;t specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don&#x27;t follow clean code, I don&#x27;t follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don&#x27;t like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I write code because its fun. I don&#x27;t care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it&#x27;s beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don&#x27;t like using iterators over loops, I don&#x27;t do operator overloading, I don&#x27;t like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I&#x27;m starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don&#x27;t like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don&#x27;t like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I&#x27;m not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That&#x27;s it for now :)</span>

Disclaimer: I am not a fan of gambling. I do not condone it. I do not recommend it. In fact, I believe online gambling and sports betting will irrevocably damage entire generations. I was terribly addicted and it really gave me bad thoughts all the time. Do not, do not gamble.
With that being said, I used to gamble, a lot. I started really young: when I was 11. It began innocuously with Team Fortress 2, betting in-game currencies like refined metals in raffle groups for larger prizes. I was on the edge of my seat for pennies. I never told my parents (hint: my family was poor). While this wasn&#x27;t particularly profitable, it was my introduction to the habit. Trading virtual items in Team Fortress 2 was more lucrative and in fact how I made most of my early s…</span>

Dans mon article précédent, j’ai constaté un malaise :
de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle m’ont déçu.
Je suis parti en envolées lyriques.
Maintenant, j’ai envie d’agir.
J’ai déjà commencé, en réalité,
depuis plusieurs semaines.
J’expérimente des trucs.
J’en ré-applique d’autres que j’avais laissés de côté.
Dans mes prochains articles,
je vais probablement me concentrer à nouveau
sur du plus &quot;jeu de rôle&quot;.
Mais j&#x27;ai l&#x27;intuition que parler de créativité en général,
ça apporte aussi quelque chose.
Me contenter de parler &quot;techniques de jeu de rôle&quot;,
c&#x27;est comme brûler une étape.

That’s kind of insane to me, I was pretty sure no one was going to read this thing, and I’m still not 100% sure why people do. I’m just some person!! I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!
Also, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.</span>

Wiz&#x27;s valuation is insane. Most people havent even heard of them. I think it was a &gt; 60x ARR multiple on this deal. Id actually be kinda pissed if I was a google shareholder and they went through with it.
Something very strange is going on with Wiz. My gut tells me if they ever IPO to go big on puts.</span>

                              <span>&gt; As a designer, I feel the need to be original. If you’re a designer, or even if you’re just interested in design, you probably feel the need to be original, too.
I&#x27;ve been a professional designer since 2006, and I got over that thinking pretty quickly. A designer trying to be strikingly original is rarely acting in service of the design. If you want to be strikingly original, you probably want to be an artist instead of a designer. What a designer fundamentally does is communicate the best solution to a problem, given the requirements, goals, and constraints of that problem. Originality is subordinate to that at best.</span>

                              <span>A well known anecdote reported by Shannon:
&quot;My greatest concern was what to call it. I thought of calling it &#x27;information,&#x27; but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it &#x27;uncertainty.&#x27; When I discussed it with John von Neumann, he had a better idea. Von Neumann told me, &#x27;You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.&#x27;&quot;
See the answers to this MathOverflow SE question (https://mathoverflow.net/questions/403036/john-von-neumanns-...) for references on the discussion whether Shannon&#x27;s entropy is the same as the one from thermodynamics.</span>

Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be a minimum base level of support? Why do we keep moving the goal posts?
And if everyone quits their job and lives in a nice apartment, where is this money going to come from? The problem with welfare today is that its a disincentive to work. Start working, you lose your transfer payments. A lot of people are stuck in this trap and don&#x27;t want to start working, forsaking valuable on the job training and socialization that will hurt them in the long run.

i&#x27;m hoping to use this blog as a means of self expression. it will be a notebook of sorts - there will be unorganized thoughts, documents of my adventures, windows into my academic &amp; career pursuits.
most of all, i&#x27;d like to share with you some of the reasons i&#x27;ve found to love life through my 20s, and in doing so, inspire you to find happiness on your own journey.

                              <span>Back in early 2016 I had a medical emergency I never saw coming and had something happen to me that resulted in my having to take early retirement. Though I am thankful it wasn&#x27;t permanent retirement to the grave.
The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can&#x27;t say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…</span>

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It&#x27;s citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers&#x27; losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).
Similarly, CMU students are driven not by dreams of passion o…</span>

I&#x27;m boon. I wanted to be an astronaut. Instead, New York City&#x27;s skyscrapers are the closest I will ever be to the stars. Unfortunately, the designers of NYC&#x27;s skyline forgot to include them.
