                              <span>Unavoidable evidence of the catastrophic consequences of climate change confronts us at every turn. Record high ocean temperatures. Once-a-century storms that appear every other year. And on and on. In the face of ongoing ecological disaster, international best-selling author Kōhei Saitō asks why our society continues to prioritize corporate profits (and the rapacious expansion on which they depend), and proposes a revolutionary alternative to unfettered capitalism: degrowth communism.
In Slow Down, Saitō provocatively argues that any solutions that don’t directly confront capitalism itself—from the COP agreements to the “Green New Deal”—represent dangerous compromises that may ultimately worsen the climate emergency. Because it creates artificial scarcity and endlessly produces commodities based on their value, rather than their usefulness, our economic system itself makes it impossible to reverse climate change so long as capitalism remains in place. The biggest contributor to the problem cannot be an integral part of its solution.
Instead, Saitō advocates for degrowth and deceleration, which he conceives as the slowing of economic activity through the democratic reform of labor and our system of production. By returning to a system of social ownership, degrowth communism, we can restore the abundance of things that we truly need, and can focus on those activities that are essential for human life.
What would this alternative look like? How do we end mass production and mass consumption without reducing living standards? What do we need to do to redress global inequality without accelerating the rate at which the planet burns?
For this launch event Saitō will be in conversation on all of this, and more, with Science for the People editor, and Pilsen Community Books collective member and CounterPunch Radio co-host Erik Wallenberg. This event occurred on May 24, 2024 at Haymarket House in Chicago. More

Although any country that challenges domination by United States corporate or military power will inevitably be the target of a sustained demonization campaign, the lies consistently issued in a torrent against Venezuela are beyond the usual level of invective. Venezuela is the most lied-about country in the corporate press of the Global North, especially in U.S. corporate media outlets.
That Venezuela has sought to align its economy to benefit its own people, instituting an impressive array of social services, health programs and political structures to facilitate grassroots participation, has drawn the consistent ire of U.S. authorities. An unrelenting cascade of lies is necessary to generate public support for the unrelenting campaign targeting the Bolivarian Revolution.

This quotation usually attributed to Thomas Jefferson, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” is a watchword that investigative reporter Greg Palast lives by. Since the contested 2000 presidential election, Palast’s voting vigil has probed America’s electoral system and abuses of it. The journalistic detective chronicled purported purging of mostly Black citizens from Florida’s voter rolls in his landmark 2002 book The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and a 2016 documentary version updated for the Trump era with the same title. Now this steadfast watchdog of voters’ rights is back with a new nonfiction cinematic inquiry wherein the reportorial gumshoe is vigilant about Vigilantes Inc.: America’s New Vote Suppression Hitmen, and Georgia is on Palast’s mind.

                              <span>Image Gallery for Bear Blog
This gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It&#x27;s also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.
Actually, the gallery add-on itself isn&#x27;t very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here&#x27;s the result (instructions below):









Instructions
The gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a &quot;section&quot;) with the class gallery. Example:


* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Since the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:


* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Finally, add the following style to your theme:
/* Gallery */
.gallery ul  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
  padding: 20px 0;
  list-style: none;
}
.gallery li {
  position: relative;
  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


There have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.
I hope you find the gallery useful!</span>

                              <span>Wow. Thank you for posting this.  I am fifty years old.  In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school.  During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying.  Life happened.  He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin.  I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college.
Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew.  He did not have the best life, but he always smiled.  When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad.  When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked.
After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy…</span>

                              <span>Email accounts are the highest common denominator in online authentication. Phones are competitive, but people lose phones. Phone numbers are more common and durable, but the security of phone numbers is leagues below that of a flagship provider email account. It makes sense that so many authentication flows work this way.
When designing a &quot;fantasy football&quot; alternate authentication system for the Internet, start with account recovery: what happens when a user loses your fancy authenticator? If the answer is &quot;they just don&#x27;t get access anymore&quot; or &quot;a panel of their peers attests to them&quot;, your fantasy authentication system also needs a fantasy species of sentient beings to serve as users, because it won&#x27;t work for humans.</span>

In the first week I was walking her and passed a bus stop mainly used by school kids. There&#x27;s a small wall behind it and she dashed around and emerged with half a sausage roll hanging out of her mouth.
To this day, every time we pass that spot she enthusiastically pulls and goes round to inspect.</span>

                              <span>I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.
For those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.
So back to the update…
Key Updates
Changing the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.
You will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).
There is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.
A battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.
The long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.
The counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.
Updated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).
The response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!
…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.
Sample photos
Photos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.

                              <span>When I was first diagnosed with depression, I found myself going down the rabbit hole - Reddit posts from ten years ago, outdated mental health forums, and scattered blogposts written by other people with depression. In a sense, I felt like a pariah compared to my peers, and I was curious how depression manifests in others compared to me, because, despite living with this condition for years, I was clueless about what it was.
People tend to think that the most telltale sign of depression is sadness, but I discovered depression manifests overwhelmingly different across individuals: those who experience the crushing sadness, those with the intense mood swings, or those with detachment from their lives. There are depressed people who neglect hygiene for days, people who live in messy rooms ov…</span>

                              <span>🗓️ // August 31 - September 6, 2024
I decided to slow down on my blog posting this week following the end of Blaugust. I have been struggling with words lately but pushed through the momentum of posting daily during August. Now I’m spending some time collecting letters to be able to fully form words and sentences again. Great advice from Courtney in that post.
I have been eyeing the reMarkable for a couple of years now but can never justify buying it when I have a perfectly good iPad Pro for notes. I still want it. They just came out with reMarkable Paper Pro, which is a colored version. The costs is nearly the same as an iPad. Ugh. I hate being financially responsible and constantly asking myself: Do I really need this?

                              <span>I was going to buy a hot dog the other day. It was easier said than done. There were so many options to choose from: the type of sausage, size, how it should be prepared, type of bread, which toppings I wanted…
Finally, I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll have an original.&quot;
It&#x27;s nice to have freedom of choice and options, but sometimes it feels more like an obstacle than an opportunity. Soon, you&#x27;ll have to fire up AI to be able to buy milk.
When it comes to my work on the Bearming theme for Bear, it&#x27;s the exact opposite—and it feels very liberating.
Since there are limitations to what can be achieved in terms of underlying markup, there aren&#x27;t many possibilities left when it comes to styling. You have to compromise and think outside the box. Also, since the theme is intended for the general public, you have to try to accomplish everything without getting too technical. It’s challenging, rewarding, and fun at the same time.
Does this mean I’d rather live in a world where everyone&#x27;s got the same boring cereal? No, of course not. I&#x27;ll take a little FOMO over waiting in line for a Trabant any day.
I think, however, that it can be useful to consciously limit ourselves somewhat in this world of possibilities. Maybe we don&#x27;t need five streaming services—at least not at the same time? Maybe it&#x27;s enough if we limit our social media accounts to one or two?
A great number of our decisions are not really our own but are suggested to us from the outside; we have succeeded in persuading ourselves that it is we who have made the decision, whereas we have actually conformed with the expectations of others, driven by the fear of isolation and by more direct threats to our life, freedom, and comfort.
Written almost a hundred years ago by social psychologist and ”FOMO guru” Erich Fromm. It makes you think, and that’s one of the positive aspects of not being too limited.</span>

                              <span>I sometimes wonder about whether the decline in IT worker quality is down to companies trying to force more and more roles onto each worker to reduce headcount.
Developers, Operations, and Security used to be dedicated roles.
Then we made DevOps and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 2/3 of the headcount, rather than integrating those teams.
Then we made DevSecOps, and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 1/3 the original roles, and that devs could just also be their operations and appsec team.
That&#x27;s not a knock on shift-left and integrated operations models; those are often good ideas. It&#x27;s just the logical outcome of those models when execs think they can get a bigger bonus by cutting costs by cutting headcounts.
Now you have new devs coming into insanely complex n-microservice environments, being asked to learn the existing codebase, being asked to learn their 5-tool CI/CD pipelines (and that ain&#x27;t being taught in school), being asked to learn to be DBAs, and also to keep up a steady code release cycle.
Is anyone really surprised they are using ChatGPT to keep up?
This is going to keep happening until IT companies stop cutting headcounts to make line go up (instead of good business strategy).</span>

                              <span>I wonder if the study includes the technical debt that more experienced developers had to tackle after the less experienced devs have contributed their AI-driven efforts. Because my personal experience has involved a lot of that in one of the companies listed in the study.
Also, I&#x27;ve personally seen more interest in AI in devs that have little interest in technology, but a big interest in delivering. PMs love them though.</span>

I&#x27;m ok. I&#x27;m hopeful for the future. I believe there&#x27;s lots of amazing stuff we can do and that Exercism has a great future. But right now it&#x27;s in a hard, low place.

In two decades of crawling through most of the declassified public nuclear material from the US nuclear weapons program, some exposure to classified material, and numerous hours of interviews with working and retired nuclear scientists he believes it&#x27;s the single most detailed schematic of an actual specific type of warhead he&#x27;s seen so far.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wellerstein
As he&#x27;s blogging about this it&#x27;s almost certain he has had real current working nuclear weapons experts from his contact list read the advances and not disagree.
Correct or not, it&#x27;s not a casual random thought from someone with no exposure to such diagrams.</span>

                              <span>This is one of the saddest posts I&#x27;ve read in a long time.
I love exercism. It&#x27;s beautiful, works in the browser and from CLI. The lessons are really well designed. It&#x27;s the perfect coding school environment.
So, I&#x27;m sad it isn&#x27;t viable.
But, I think I am really saddened by the comments here, second guessing all the decisions they made. If I were to second guess the people behind most of the comments, I would assume no one has ever run a business with payroll, or built something with this much reach. The comments ring really hollow for the most part and seem really callous given this person has sunk his life into making the world, and my life, a better place. I&#x27;m scared for the moment he is in life and sad there are not more positive comments, and even better, comments from people where they would actually help by making a donation.</span>

                              <span>Ring cameras freak me out. Whenever I am unfortunate enough to see their ads, they seem dystopian to me. What I am fortunate in is not being in a country that is seemingly dominated by them, at least not yet.
It was already enough that entering people’s home increasingly meant being comfortable with Alexa and others, or that being in public meant you could either be in the background or the unkowing main topic of some TikTok video. I guess we are now increasingly entering an era where being outside means being filmed by a private person’s camera somewhere, or that you’ll even be recorded while visiting someone inside their home.
Now, I will say, I feel sympathy for the people using these in genuinely rough areas, or having survived some horrible break-ins. It hasn’t ever happened to me, bu…</span>

                              <span>Ironically, my answer is blogging.
I’ve abandoned four blogs this year, none lasting more than 60 days. My problem hasn’t been building the sites; it’s with my comfort level writing in public.
Things have improved recently. I’ve posted 11 days in a row. I’m determined to push past this awkward stage and find my voice.
The more you practice, the easier it gets.
I stopped trying to be perfect. I don&#x27;t have to write an essay. If it&#x27;s a short post, that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s no word count requirement. As long as I publish something, it&#x27;s a win!
Show up each day and give it your best shot. How else could you expect to improve?
If you&#x27;re a new blogger who can relate to this struggle, I hope this post encourages you. Don’t stress over clicking publish. Just share your honest thoughts. We want to hear your story.

                              <span>I use a lot of emojis when I write (especially chat), and it has always struck me as interesting that most people around me don’t. “Don’t they want to convey how they feel about this?” I ask myself. So much so that, for a long time, I thought my overuse of emojis came from a needy, co-dependent part of me that wanted to be pleasant to others and avoid any misunderstandings by being extra clear that I wasn’t angry or displeased with them through the use of the smiley face.
It wasn’t until quite recently that I realized my use of emojis was not “a weak front” (as is usually viewed by the professional and academic worlds), though it is neither a strength. What is it then? Well, it’s just an extra set of punctuation marks.
Emojis have drastically evolved since their first (genius) inception an…</span>

                              <span>My wife and I knew within a week of seeing each other that we would eventually get married. I had an adjustment to make though. In all my previous relationships, I&#x27;d been the biggest breadwinner in the family. This time that wouldn&#x27;t be the case. I was a public-school employee, and she was a partner in the most prestigious accounting firm in the area, earning about triple my salary. As life struggles go, making that mental adjustment wasn&#x27;t remarkably hard, but it did require me to reexamine myself, never a bad thing. I let go of the ego boost that earning a bigger wage gave me in the past and haven&#x27;t really thought about it much since then. We&#x27;ve never had an argument over money, even if she, with her accountant&#x27;s attention to detail, knows and often mentions the bank transactions I creat…</span>

Afterwards the Democrats seemed ecstatic that a little genocide didn’t disrupt their joy. But there were still plenty of protests and signs of divisions that could pose problems with Harris’s path to election especially as student protesters look to reinvigorate the movement. More

                              <span>This entire piece starts from the conclusion that engineers leave because they aren&#x27;t paid enough then works backwards from there. This is wrong from my experience. Anecdotally, I have never left a job because of money. Sure, I left jobs and got ones that ended up paying more money but the reason I started looking in the first place wasn&#x27;t money. It was for other reasons that usually included frustrations with management.</span>

                              <span>You do it during work hours. Period.
Your brain only has so many truly &#x27;on&#x27; hours in a day, and it&#x27;s already less than 8.  Trying to burn even more in the pursuit of complex knowledge isn&#x27;t just robbing Peter to pay Paul, it&#x27;s eating the seed corn and wondering why your harvest failed.
It&#x27;s a scary thing to realize, and can be hard to stick with.  But limits are real, and respecting them gets more work done in the long run than not.</span>

                              <span>Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30&#x27;s) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.
I just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other&#x27;s people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn&#x27;t out to impress anybody, I just became &quot;Mr. Dependable&quot; on any of the teams I worked on.
This was the approach that changed everything.
Now, some ten years later? I&#x27;m never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that&#x27;s it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.
I found out that if you don&#x27;t protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You&#x27;ll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.
Protect yourself. Protect your sanity. Once you lose it, like OP said, it&#x27;s very, very hard to get back.
I hope this helps someone else struggling to break this cycle.</span>

                              <span>I disagree with this assessment on  many levels, but I think the most important challenge I can make is to the idea that Brewster Kahle is a rogue actor, who in some sense mis-interpreted the mission and strategy of the Internet Archive.
For those of you who are just learning that name from this lawsuit, here&#x27;s his wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle
Kahle founded the Archive in the nineties, in the midst of the fairly determined attempts at that time to either delay or even re-engineer the early Internet to be more respectful of existing intellectual property and decency laws.
We inherit a searchable, saveable web, because of the work done then to establish the norm that the Internet itself should exist, and that open digital archives can exist, legally. Many many…</span>

                              <span>I just got back from getting my hair lopped at Mastercuts. $30. And let me tell you, this lady got it right, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a small fortune.
I stopped and got a cream cheese and lox bagel with a blood orange Pelligrino around the corner from the salon. I sat by the window, and people watched, hurrying to and from their office jobs high in the sky.
The bagel was alright, although I think I got spoiled living at Bathurst and Lawrence, a predominantly Jewish community, with their spectacular bagels, that now, every other bagel shop, pales in comparison. My people know how to make a mean cream cheese and lox.
I&#x27;ve been up to my neck in job search.
There&#x27;s one in particular I&#x27;m hoping will call back. Not because I like the job, but because it&#x27;s close to home, and i can do the job with my eyes closed.

I&#x27;m still spending most of my writing efforts on my email blog.
I wrote two letters: end of august diary, and deep affection. Hope you liked them &lt;3

This past week, I&#x27;ve been trying out Substack. I know, I know, a lot of you don&#x27;t like the platform for various reasons. I&#x27;m with you on quite a few of them.
But. BUT. What a pleasure it is to write in their editor. Things WORK! Can you even imagine?
There are no weird formatting issues. I can easily upload a picture and write a caption easy peasy. Bullet lists don&#x27;t go all wonky when i hit publish.
But on the flip side, it doesn&#x27;t feel like my writing home. The writers use the same writerly language, discussing Important Things in highly sophisticated, educated, long-form essays.
I feel like the outcast in the cafeteria sitting by myself eating a wet sandwich my mom made me.

                              <span>I agree with you about copyright, but the fact is that the IA never had a chance and we knew it years ago.
The top comment on HN a week after their launch of the EL is critical [0], right at the moment when HN would be most expected to rally to their defense. By the time the lawsuit was actually starting to take shape most commenters had become very concerned for the fate of the IA [1]. This is on a forum that reliably champions freedom of information, but most of us knew even at the time that what they&#x27;d done was extremely unlikely to pass muster.
The IA was never going to be hailed as a cultural hero because they stood no chance, and they are too valuable for other, unrelated reasons to make themselves a martyr. This never should have happened under the same legal entity as the web archive.

If IA had won, IA would be hailed as a cultural hero. They hit and they missed. Claiming Brewster Kahle is against &quot;the people who work very hard to bring new books into being&quot; is unfair. The copyright goalposts have moved so far past where they were originally, the people who work very hard can be dead for decades and their works still in copyright, and by the time they are dead for 70 years, the copyright will probably be extended again.</span>

                              <span>This has been playing out for many years. And it&#x27;s all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive&#x27;s mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.
When IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:
The Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.
https://nwu.org/nwu-denounces-cdl/
When the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.
He also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see https://blog.archive.org/2023/12/15/brewster-kahle-appeal-st...). It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the logical outcome of one man&#x27;s seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.
In addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society. I truly hope the organization can survive.</span>

                              <span>Very much not a surprise.  I think the Internet Archive is providing an invaluable service to humanity in preserving works that would otherwise be lost to time.  it is one of the crown jewels of the Internet, doing a job that nobody else is willing to do.  But at the same time I know the courts side with publishers pretty much every time and copyright law being such as it is they&#x27;re totally screwed. The only real question is how many trillions dollars will the judgment be.  Preserving history is at odds with the profit motive, and lawmakers care a lot more about the latter than the former.</span>

                              <span>I had a discussion with someone recently about how tech is enabling enforcement of laws/policies/etc at a scale never before possible and how that is a bad thing. The problem is that people can&#x27;t conform perfectly and the tighter we force people to conform the more likely they are to &#x27;break&#x27; and disconnect from society. Basically, if &#x27;acceptable&#x27; is so narrowly defined that you can&#x27;t achieve it 100% of the time, why try even a little to conform? In companies there is somewhat of an off-ramp, quit (which isn&#x27;t always a realistic option obviously), but these enforcement abilities are invading areas that we can&#x27;t avoid and that is a real problem.</span>

                              <span>To repeat myself from a recent HN thread:
I&#x27;ve been using Kagi for a while (almost two years now!) and it&#x27;s been nothing but excellent!
Lenses are very useful (Reddit lens is on every second search), and I personally really like the AI features they are working on.
The new more advanced assistant which is able to do searches, which can also be constrained to lenses, and lets you pick an arbitrary model, is excellent, and basically means I don&#x27;t need a chatgpt/claude subscription, as Kagi covers it very well.
All in all, great product which I&#x27;m happy to pay for.</span>

                              <span>Intel is trapped. Its debt repayments alone are massive. The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.
They don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board.
Without talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up.</span>

                              <span>FWIW, I’ve worked at many RedHat shops over the years and I’ve never seen one where disabling SELinux wasn’t a normal part of provisioning a server. I haven’t seen the same thing with AppArmor (although I admit I have less visibility into debian systems administration). YMMV but it seems to me that a component which is so inconvenient that it’s normally disabled doesn’t provide much security in the end.</span>

The software is moving too slowly and often in a wrong direction. Especially since they released the keyboard folio most updates were around typing (which is supar on any eink device)... and they generally made my experience as a pen user worse.
I don&#x27;t care if the new hardware is awesome, whenever mine breaks I will switch to a competitor.

                              <span>I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.
I feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.
I mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.
There was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.
I missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.
So here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.
Side note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?

                              <span>The rapid rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically change the labor market, and indeed possibly even the nature of work itself. However, how firms are adjusting their workforces to accommodate this emerging technology is not yet clear. Our August regional business surveys asked manufacturing and service firms special topical questions about their use of AI, and how it is changing their workforces. Most firms that report expected AI use in the next six months plan to retrain their workforces, with far fewer reporting adjustments to planned headcounts.</span>

                              <span>Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

                              <span>This is not how these kinds of things should be designed for the web.
Instead of putting resources in the root of the web, this is what /.well-known/ was designed for. See RFC 5785:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785
Instead of munging URLs to get alternate formats, this is what content negotiation or rel&#x3D;alternate were designed for.
I’m not sure making it easier to consume content is something that is needed. I think it might be more useful to define script type&#x3D;llm that would expose function calling to LLMs embedded in browsers.</span>

An attacker not only needs your username and password, they also need physical access to your key. They then have to disassemble the device. If they want to give it back to you, they&#x27;ll need to reassemble it.
So not exactly trivial!

But this does highlight one weakness of these FIDO tokens - you have to manually maintain a list of where you&#x27;ve registered them. And if your token is lost or stolen, you have to manually revoke every single one.</span>

                              <span>I found this interesting:
&gt; Another option is to put it to beneficial use to create heat or even electricity. The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.
And towards the end
&gt; Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere... But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.
I love reading about landfills. I wish more environmentalists would be excited about engineering solving environmental ills and relied less on knee-jerk reactions.</span>

                              <span>The office I work out of runs an opt-in coffee chat program which
matches you with someone each week to have a short chat over coffee. I
don&#x27;t know anyone in the office, so at the behest of my director I
signed up.
I had my first coffee chat today. The guy I was supposed to meet with
showed up fifteen minutes late, which might have irked me if (i) I
hadn&#x27;t rescheduled our chat something like three times and (ii) if I
actually enjoyed networking. Even though our conversation wasn&#x27;t bad,
all things considered, I still found myself rather grateful when we
had to run to our 4 PM meetings. I always feel phony networking with
other people in the office, especially when they&#x27;re a married
fortysomething busy salesman high up on the org chart who has better
things to do than talk to a lowly peasant…</span>

                              <span>I am deeply and hopelessly in love and there&#x27;s not much I can do about it. Luckily, the object of my affection is my wife of eleven years. Whenever we are separated, regardless for how long, I unconsciously begin a countdown in my mind until I see her again, even it it&#x27;s just from the beginning of the work day until lunch. I&#x27;ve never known anyone as well as I know her. I can tell her mood from the sound of her footsteps as she descends the stairs from our bedroom into the living room. Neither of us ever attempt to hide an emotion from the other, so intune we are with each other&#x27;s feelings.
My wife is a classic introvert. Our home is her haven, the place where she recharges her batteries. I long ago accepted the responsibility for answering every knock at the door and being the one to deal …</span>

                              <span>The post-COVID years have not been kind to professional forecasters, whether from the private sector or policy institutions: their forecast errors for both output growth and inflation have increased dramatically relative to pre-COVID (see Figure 1 in this paper). In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.</span>

                              <span>i dont like getting asked &quot;what have you been up to?&quot;. i don&#x27;t know. i could have had the most interesting past few days, or the most uneventful, and i would simply not remember. my memory is slim these days, and comes to me in fleeting moments when i can form links with events in the present. sitting here in the sun the sun sends me back to the beach i was on this summer. the embrace from a friend brings the scent of the perfume my grandmother used to wear. the unassumed path we bike on takes me to my mom&#x27;s hometown. i wonder at times if i only remember things by association.

i&#x27;ve been doing a lot of things recently, which has been nice. i&#x27;ve been seeing friends and getting out of the house most days. at times i wonder if this is what life is supposed to be all about; these joyful moments shared with others, kept a secret from the rest of the world. i don&#x27;t take many photos when i&#x27;m out like that. my mom gets mad i don&#x27;t have anything to show for my outings. having a photo of the occasion makes me feel like i have cheated myself out of a memory by constraining it to a handful of pixels. who do i need prove i had a good time to?</span>
