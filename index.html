                              <span>over the weekend, i decided i wanted to add a now page to my site. the problem here is that i am bad at remembering to update things (especially more than one thing). in my ideal world, i could have it live update with things like what movies i&#x27;ve watched recently (from letterboxd), tv (trakt, which i don&#x27;t currently use but maybe should), music (only once i fix my scrobbling setup), books (storygraph), etc etc etc.
at a glance, you&#x27;d assume that bear doesn&#x27;t support this sort of thing, given its static-approach. i would say that this is a limitation of imagination; you can actually just throw whatever in here, including in the header and footer.
my first test for this is using htmx to populate a list of recently watched movies (served by a small app at blog-data.jkap.io) on page load. while it&#x27;s not perfect (i don&#x27;t love the &quot;loading&quot; flash and layout shift) it was easy to setup and works Well Enough for now.
when i say easy, i mean it. this is the extent of the code:

  loading...


you can see it in action on my now page. i&#x27;m planning to add more in here over time. just gimme a bit.</span>

&gt; Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.
Replace &quot;youtube videos&quot; with whatever the company is trying to achieve. I see it all the time in large organizations, where different teams forget what the goal of the company is and instead get hyperfocused on their teams KPI&#x27;s to the detriment of the company as a whole.
Lawyers finding problems and trying to stop things from happening instead of finding solutions. Security blocking things and not suggesting alternatives. IT blocking this or that instead of trying solve problems, etc.</span>

                              <span>The vast majority of Americans believe that the United States economy is unfairly rigged to benefit the rich. In the past few weeks, the Democratic nominee for president, Kamala Harris, has proven that this is an accurate assessment. She initially backed her own administration’s initiative to increase top earners’ total tax rate including on capital gains to nearly 45 percent. This was included in President Joe Biden’s 2025 budget proposal. But soon after billionaire donors made it clear they preferred not to part with any fraction of their wealth, she pivoted, announcing in September that she backed a significantly lower capital gains tax rate of 33 percent.

                              <span>One distressing trend I&#x27;ve noticed becoming ubiquitous on HN is that any writing that is confronting to a consensus worldview becomes flooded with highly upvoted comments that are, in essence, excuses for why it&#x27;s not necessary in this instance to re-examine your priors.
He&#x27;s making low value content/the culture of the company is horrible/he&#x27;s a fraud/it&#x27;s more luck than skill. The actual critiques are personalized to the content and, to one extent or another, valid, but the social purpose of the critiques is universal which is that I felt uncomfortable that reading this might mean I have to re-evaluate my worldview and I&#x27;m going to dive into the comment section and upvote all the people telling me actually, I don&#x27;t have to do that.
I actually spent over an hour writing 750+ words of my takeaways reading this document and shared it privately with a few founder friends of mine and I briefly considered also posting to share with the community but I took a look at the comments and took a look at what I wrote and decided I didn&#x27;t have the energy to face the endless onslaught of nitpicks and misunderstandings that are driven, at the end of the day, not by a genuine intellectual desire to reach an understanding, but by the need to prove emotionally that others are not taking this seriously so I don&#x27;t have to either.
All I can do is be vague and say I think this was an enormously valuable piece of writing that is worth engaging seriously for what it is as it might change your worldview in several important ways.
But also my larger meta-point is that there&#x27;s a now near ubiquitous &quot;sour grapes&quot; attitude that&#x27;s pervaded HN that makes it an extremely unpleasant place to hold a conversation and people reading should be aware of this systematic bias when reading comments here.</span>

                              <span>It all feels like theatre. Been working in many companies in “war mode” and they all think that in order to become profitable (none of them were) you need to push the most “important” features out of the door asap, otherwise your competitors will eat you alive.
It’s a lie. Executives and VPs and all those folks that earn 5x what a normal engineer earns, don’t really care about the company they work for. All they care about is to keep receiving the big pay checks until the ship sinks. Obviously you cannot just mandate “normal mode”, otherwise it wouldn’t look as if everyone is doing their best to keep the company afloat.

                              <span>Lot of people critiquing this, but you can&#x27;t deny the success. I think a lot of the advice is applicable to startups.
1. KPIs, for Beast they are CTR, AVD, AVP, will look different if you are a startup. I am willing to bet he knows his metrics better than &gt;95% of startup founders. Because he is literally hacking/being judged by an algorithm, his KPIs will matter more and can be closely dissected. Startups aren&#x27;t that easy in that sense, but KPIs still matter.
2. Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.
3. Building value &gt; making money
4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders/equity owners, not employees.
5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.
The management/communication stuff is mostly about working on set/dealing with physical scale. You need a lot more hands dealing with logistics, which requires hardline communication and management. In startups, the team is usually really lean and technical, so management becomes more straightforward.
I am also getting some bad culture vibes from the PDF and really dislike the writing style. I think it&#x27;s important not to micromanage to the extent he is--it&#x27;s necessary, maybe, for his business. Not for startups. Interesting perspective, reminds me of a chef de cuisine in a cutthroat 90s kitchen. The dishes (videos) have to be perfect, they require a lot of prep and a lot of hands, and you have to consistently pump them out.</span>

Bitcoin puzzles are private keys with just a few unknown bits so that anyone can bruteforce them to collect a reward. Puzzle 66 contained 66 unknown bits and had 6.6 BTC deposited into it by the initial puzzle creator. The private key was 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002832ed74f2b5e35ee or 256 bits with mostly zeroes but 66 random ones.
The next Bitcoin puzzle, #67, has 67 unknown bits, and contains 6.7 BTC up for grabs: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BY8GQbnue...
The previous puzzle by order of difficulty was #64 (not #65, because see below) and was solved on 9/9/2022, so about 2 years ago. In other words, it took about 2 years of compute time to run the 2^66 bruteforcing task.
Puzzles that are multiple of 5 (#65 or #70) are special: they have twice more entropy. So that private key #65 doesn&#x27;t have 65-bit of entropy but 130-bit of entropy. And the creator of the puzzle intentionally published their public key on the blockchain. When you know the public key, brutetforcing the n-bit private key only requires 2^(n/2) work. So puzzle #65 with a 130-bit key actually require bruteforcing up to only 2^65 keys.</span>

                              <span>This sucks. Cache basically guaranteed that whatever Google thought was on the page could actually be found.
These days Google will offer a result where the little blurb (which is actually a truncated mini cache) shows a part of the information I&#x27;m looking for, but the page itself does not. Removing cache means the data is just within reach, but you can&#x27;t get to it anymore.
Internet Archive is a hassle and not as reliable as an actual copy of the page where the blurb was extracted from.</span>

A Chromebook was a curiosity at the time, promising to run most of your software in &quot;someone else&#x27;s computer&quot;; all you needed was the internet and the interface.

When I inspect houses as part of my work, I always advise homeowners to check their attics a couple of times a year. I also suggest making it as easy as possible to do so, for example by installing a built-in ladder. If it feels too cumbersome to check your attic, it&#x27;s easy to put it off.
For the same reason, I want as little resistance as possible when it comes to blogging. I keep my blog post ideas easily accessible, no matter where I am. When it&#x27;s time to write, I do it in the default text editor if I&#x27;m at my computer, or in my phone&#x27;s standard notes app.
After translating (I always write in Swedish) and editing the text, I open the browser shortcut to create a new blog post. I preview it and maybe do some formatting. Then I publish the post.
The Blogging Workflow
When I read certain blogging workflows, I&#x27;m surprised at how complicated they seem. At the same time, I think that for those particular bloggers, the technical aspect is one of the reasons they enjoy blogging. It&#x27;s not a barrier; it&#x27;s an example of the importance of interests.
My approach of writing in Swedish and then translating into English can certainly be perceived as complicated. But I find it fun and interesting. It took quite a while before I found a way to write in English in a way that I felt good about.
Regardless of your approach to blogging, make sure it feels easy and fun. &quot;Easy&quot; is of course very individual in this case. That&#x27;s where the &quot;fun&quot; part comes in - easy can be technically complicated in a fun way.
3 Tips for Easy Blogging
It should work on any device.
It should work no matter where you are.
It should be easy to go from writing to publishing.
We live in a time of almost unlimited possibilities. Take this opportunity to play around. Find a setup that suits you, and don&#x27;t be afraid to try new methods.
Keep on blogging!</span>

I don&#x27;t have extra computers and phones lying around like some folks do, so I avoid installing beta editions of the software on my devices, content to following along in the news as new features are trotted out and perfected in  the period between the June announcement and the fall release of the final product. The majority of iPhone users and Mac owners have no idea what&#x27;s coming though. They are going to wake up on Monday to an unwelcome notification that there is an update available. Many of them will ask their techie friends (like you) if there is a way to make the update notification go away. They will want to know if they have to install it.

Under threat from Israeli tanks, the parents and siblings of Ms. Kamla (a pseudonym) were forced to evacuate al-Bureij camp and relocate to her central Gaza home in al-Maghazi on December 25, 2023. Three days later an Israeli tank fired a shell into her home, though thankfully their family was gathered in a different room of the house so there were no injuries. Since December 28, Kamla and her family have been displaced 7 or 8 times.
When the Israeli tanks finished their operation, Kamla left the tent she had evacuated to in Dier al-Balah. She went to see if her house was still standing. She found it partially destroyed, yet still she tried to clear the rubble to live in it once more. That was not the end however, as Israel returned with more tanks and bombs.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve learned to hate software process.  If you have team sizes set sanely and empower devs to do what they need to do in order to accomplish the goal, they&#x27;ll be fine without the management overhead of arbitrarily imposed productivity flow.  Agile et al, along with 99% of the features in ticketing systems, exist to make managers feel like they are justifying their paycheck.
If you are a manager and this makes you angry, you&#x27;re one of the bad ones.</span>

                              <span>If you want to do code-CAD for anything substantial and you haven&#x27;t yet developed a significant dependency on OpenSCAD, do your brain a favour and spend at least some time with CadQuery, Build123D or (if you prefer JS to Python) Replicad.
As impressive as NopSCADlib and BOSL2 are (and OMG they are, when you consider what they have to work with!), OpenSCAD is a one-way, declarative CSG environment that essentially only outputs mesh formats. It&#x27;s really not that much better than working with three-dimensional pixels. You won&#x27;t really be able to analyse, iterate over or measure your models, easily build on faces, do easy chamfers or fillets, export STEP files, make use of constraint-based designs, model assemblies, or so many other things that &quot;CAD&quot; means in the 21st century. All the tools that help you do this on OpenSCAD are layers and layers of task-specific hacks and clever bodges.
I totally get wanting to make models with version-controlled text files instead of GUI CAD (which can be a sort of weird battle to learn for a programmer), and I get wanting to avoid FreeCAD. I just don&#x27;t really get wanting to limit oneself to such a limited concept of a 3D &quot;model&quot;!
The three alternative systems I mention are all based around bindings to (or in Replicad&#x27;s case, cross-compilation of) OpenCASCADE, which is a bRep CAD kernel capable of much richer interactions. It is not without its faults, but arguably code-CAD spares you from some of the inscrutability that trips up FreeCAD&#x27;s interactive model.</span>

4) Hold these debtors to standards that aren&#x27;t applied to other types of debtors. You cannot discharge them through bankruptcy, it&#x27;s very difficult to renegotiate, and SCOTUS has said that the chief executive of the note-holding institution (in this case, the President of the United States) cannot use discretion in deciding who he gets to forgive for loans.</span>

                              <span>Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.
I work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it&#x27;s able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many &quot;problem shapes&quot;. For instance, I can give it a logic problem like &quot;i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially&quot; and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.
Yes, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.
side: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.
Many of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.</span>

                              <span>A common comment when it comes to blogging is that people don&#x27;t know what to write about. There&#x27;s even a dedicated &quot;What to blog about?&quot; category on the Blog Inspiration page.
While I understand that many feel this way, the &quot;problem&quot; for me is rather the opposite: I have so many ideas that I don&#x27;t know which one to choose. And on those rare occasions when I&#x27;m completely out of ideas, I write even if I have nothing to write about.
My biggest source of inspiration is everyday life. Even the most trivial moments carry something interesting. It could be something someone says or does, a certain environment, or something I&#x27;m engaged in:
A podcast.
A book.
A song.
A documentary.
A movie.
It&#x27;s swarming with blog posts waiting to be written, if we&#x27;re just paying attention. When such a potential post crosses my path, I usually make a note, a voice memo, or take a photo, depending on what&#x27;s easiest in the context. Currently, there are two photos and three notes waiting to become blog posts.
Of course, this setup doesn&#x27;t suit all types of blogs. But I dare say that it&#x27;s an approach that works for the majority of bloggers.
How has your day been? What have you experienced? What people have you met? What have you seen, read, and heard? What thoughts have popped up?
Start writing, in your own way, and share it.
It&#x27;s your blog. There are no rules.</span>

On one hand, I live in the least unionized state in America and retired from a career as a state employee where we were forbidden by law from engaging in collective bargaining, a law that was created to stop white and black workers in Charlotte from organizing together back in the 1950s. On the other hand, I believe in not being a burden on my co-workers and in the benefits of taking on hard tasks.

                              <span>Found out that the CrowdStrike Mac agent (Falcon) sends all your secrets from environment variables to their cloud hosted SIEM. In plain text.
Anyone with access to your CS SIEM can search for GitHub, aws, etc creds. Anything your devs, ops and sec teams use on their Macs.
Only the Mac version does this. There is no way to disable this behaviour or a way to redact things.
Another really odd design decision. They probably have many many thousands of plain text secrets from their customers stored in their SIEM.</span>

Except the biggest IT outage ever.  And a postmortem showing their validation checks were insufficient.  And a rollout process that did not stage at all, just rawdogged straight to global prod.  And no lab where the new code was actually installed and run prior to global rawdogging.
I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s smoke, and numerous accounts of fire, which this can be taken in the context of.</span>

                              <span>Okay this is just getting suspicious. Their excuses for keeping the chain of thought hidden are dubious at best [1], and honestly just seemed anti-competitive if anything. Worst is their argument that they want to monitor it for attempts to escape the prompt, but you can&#x27;t. However the weirdest is that they note that:
&gt; for this to work the model must have freedom to express its thoughts in unaltered form, so we cannot train any policy compliance or user preferences onto the chain of thought.
Which makes it sound like they really don&#x27;t want it to become public what the model is &#x27;thinking&#x27;. This is strengthened by actions like this that just seem needlessly harsh, or at least a lot stricter than they were.
Honestly with all the hubbub about superintelligence you&#x27;d almost think o1 is secretly plotting the demise of humanity but is not yet smart enough to completely hide it.

Here are basically people paying, and paying a lot, for parasocial relationships. Because clearly it’s not about the content per see which is a dim a dozen and available for free in trove.
I think it says something quite dark about our society as a whole that we have basically commoditised distress and are encouraging some people often themselves in dire circumstances to prey on others to the benefits of the middle men. I find these new pimps scarier than the old sort in that they pretend to have clean hands.</span>

That’s the problem: it’s a _terrible_ intern. A good intern will ask clarifying questions, tell me “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure I did it right”. LLMs do none of that, they will take whatever you ask and give a reasonable-sounding output that might be anything between brilliant and nonsense.
With an intern, I don’t need to measure how good my prompting is, we’ll usually interact to arrive to a common understanding. With a LLM, I need to put a huge amount of thought into the prompt and have no idea whether the LLM understood what I’m asking and if it’s able to do it.</span>

                              <span>Boeing spent $43B on stock buybacks between 2013 and 2019 while paying their CEO ~$30M/year.
&gt; To support its share price, the company under McNerney poured billions into stock buybacks instead of investing profits into the kind of research and development needed to stay competitive. McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.
&gt; McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.
&gt; McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)

                              <span>The failure is in how you&#x27;re using it. I don&#x27;t mean this as a personal attack, but more to shed light on what&#x27;s happening.
A lot of people use LLMs as a search engine. It makes sense - it&#x27;s basically a lossy compressed database of everything its ever read, and it generates output that is statistically likely - varying degrees of likeliness depending on the temperature, as well as how many times the particular weights your prompt ends up activating.
The magic of LLMs, especially one like this that supposedly has advanced reasoning, isn&#x27;t the existing knowledge in its weights. The magic is that _it knows english_. It knows english at or above a level equal to most fluent speakers, and it also can produce output that is not just a likely output, but is a logical output. It&#x27;s not _just_ an output engine. It&#x27;s an engine that outputs.
Asking it about nuanced details in the corpus of data it has read won&#x27;t give you good output unless it read a bunch of it.
On the other hand, if you were to paste the entire documentation set to a tool it has never seen and ask it to use the tool in a way to accomplish your goals, THEN this model would be likely to produce useful output, despite the fact that it had never encountered the tool or its documentation before.
Don&#x27;t treat it as a database. Treat it as a naive but intelligent intern. Provide it data, give it a task, and let it surprise you with its output.</span>

                              <span>hello! it&#x27;s blogging time.
now that cohost is shutting down, i&#x27;m setting up a new home for whatever long-form (or even medium-form) writing i do. i&#x27;ve found over time that the microblogging formats of most social media don&#x27;t really work for me, and i like having ownership / control of my writing. so here we are.
i&#x27;m spending some time migrating some of my favorite posts over from cohost to here; you can view them in the #cohost tag if you so wish.
i&#x27;m planning to write more about my overall Feelings around the cohost shutdown soon; there&#x27;s a lot of things i&#x27;d do differently if we were to do it again, but i&#x27;m proud of what we accomplished regardless.
one thing that i&#x27;ve been contending with in the wake of the shutdown announcement is the outpouring of love for cohost that i&#x27;ve gotten from s…</span>

As someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.
Active alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I&#x27;d been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours. I was never the kind of person to keep beer in the fridge for later or to maintain a bar so that I could m…</span>

                              <span>I did not think I would ever be spinning a blog again. I think I did in the, like, pre-Google Blogger days? Or something? I was 14. I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.
This will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized &quot;here&#x27;s an important update&quot; kinda thing but that&#x27;s a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don&#x27;t think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.
So here&#x27;s a blog. How often will I post here? I don&#x27;t know! I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s actually kind of nice! I don&#x27;t need to give a shit about it. It&#x27;s a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don&#x27;t need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!
Subscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.
If you&#x27;d like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.
Thanks for reading and if you&#x27;re coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active. The community there was something I&#x27;ll cherish forever.</span>

Almost 60% of AIPAC’s money comes from corporate CEOs and other top executives from Fortune 500 companies. The largest single donor to the United Democracy Project is Jan Koum, the multibillionaire former CEO of WhatsApp and a regular Republican funder. The biggest institutional contributors to UDP come from FIRE, finance/insurance and real estate sectors. More

                              <span>The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More

                              <span>President Biden’s neglect of arms control and disarmament means that the next president will inherit a nuclear landscape that is more threatening and volatile than any other since the Cuban missile crisis more than 60 years ago.  The Cuban missile crisis, however, was a wake up call for both President John F. Kennedy and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, leading to a series of arms control and disarmament treaties beginning with the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963.   More

                              <span>The day after the debate, I woke up to the resounding evidence that Harris had floated like a butterfly over the proceedings and occasionally had stung the hapless Trump like a bee. He, I was assured, had done no better on tariffs, Gaza, Ukraine, abortion, climate change, or January 6 than he had with his eloquence over the Springfield protein diet. Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

                              <span>The very notion that it is acceptable to tie one&#x27;s health in a civilized nation to having ample cash is clearly anathema to most of the world, but it&#x27;s the way things are in the United States. Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More

                              <span>This is incredible. In April I used the standard GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to help me reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol used by my kitchen fan to integrate it into Home Assistant.
It was helpful in a rubber duck way, but could not determine the pattern used to transmit the remaining runtime of the fan in a certain mode. Initial prompt here [0]
I pasted the same prompt into o1-preview and o1-mini and both correctly understood and decoded the pattern using a slightly different method than I devised in April. Asking the models to determine if my code is equivalent to what they reverse engineered resulted in a nuanced and thorough examination, and eventual conclusion that it is equivalent. [1]
Testing the same prompt with gpt4o leads to the same result as April&#x27;s GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) model.
Amazing progress.

                              <span>I love the idea of a digital garden. I first heard about them in an article by Maggie Appleton where she wrote:
Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.
I’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  It&#x27;s a place where I can experiment with creative projects and test new ideas.
Some Examples
This week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.

Neither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.
I also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.
I’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.
Over time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.
None of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.
What are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?</span>

                              <span>Hello!
Once again I have abandoned my Substack. Will, you say, you&#x27;ve done this before. And, sure, yes. Last time I bailed on Substack I migrated to Blogspot, but I didn&#x27;t really like the platform much. This platform is much simpler, a lot less busted, and has RSS and Atom feeds. I also like that it has no trackers or JavaScript.
I&#x27;ve had some weird feelings about maintaining my own Substack for a while now. I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m personally cut out for the platform: I don&#x27;t have a single subject I can write about consistently (and, to be honest, I don&#x27;t think I can really write consistently at all); I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s massively metrics-based as I really don&#x27;t care about that sort of thing; I don&#x27;t like the constant push to monetize when I&#x27;ve never had any intention of doing that; and, honestly, I was kind of running out of things to say. The fiction I posted just felt like filler so that people would remember the blog existed at all. Sad!
I&#x27;m not entirely sure what&#x27;s going to go here yet but I&#x27;m excited to have what feels like a rather cozier corner of the internet than Substack or Twitter. I&#x27;ve also been remaking my website from the ground up to be less of a professional presence and more of a personal one. I&#x27;ve been having a great time with it. Stay tuned.</span>

separately, i’ve also been known to blog about games, music, and other things that interest me. i had an ongoing series of longer posts on the website Cohost, which I’m no longer able to continue due to it shutting down. i hope to use this blog to keep the long-form posting alive. so if you like(d) reading my thoughts on games and other media, those will continue here as well!</span>

i was contemplating setting up a newsletter, and that is well and dandy, but ultimately there’s a lot of baggage that comes from blasting out emails to everyone’s inboxes every time i want to write something on a whim. that’s not necessarily what i’m here for!
i&#x27;ve done my best to port over &amp; fill out the archive with some of my game blogs and other ‘best of’ from cohost, tagging those where appropriate! and then we’ll keep on going… i hope you’ll stick around, subscribe to the rss or atom feed, whatever keeps you updated!
so if you’re new here, have a little dose of introduction:

I created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist&#x27;s advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.

I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.
There came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.
I continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.
While I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.
I’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.

 1. the vandalism of capitalist propaganda 
 2. subvertising; parodies of advertisements 
 3. protest art to hide advertisement. 
 Our main goal is removing advertisement from the public space. 
 As citizens we should have a say in how our public space looks, we do not accept government renting out the space to some companies, that is supposed to be for all of us. 
 We accept bus stop advertisement as a method to support the bus stop. But there is no excuse for stand alone advertisement in the public space, in this zine we will show some tactics to rem…</span>

Abstract
 The article explores the theoretical complicities between the thought of Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille. Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized. In this way, through an analy…</span>

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>I have never heard of Pave before, but this just sounds like yet another copy of Equifax&#x27;s &quot;The Work Number&quot; [1].  Basically, HR at many companies gives your salary and employment history data to Equifax, who then sells access to the information to certain parties with supposed need to access it, including potential and current employers and creditors.  This report is likely one of the most invasive consumer files out there for many people.
I cannot comment on the legality of this kind of data sharing, but as I and others have pointed out, it has existed for a while.  I do agree that it is concerning.  You can freeze your Equifax The Work Number report at least, just like other credit reports.

                              <span>Obviously there are a lot of errors by a lot of people that led to this, but here&#x27;s one that would&#x27;ve prevented this specific exploit:
&gt; As part of our research, we discovered that a few years ago the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD migrated from whois.dotmobiregistry.net to whois.nic.mobi – and the dotmobiregistry.net domain had been left to expire seemingly in December 2023.
Never ever ever ever let a domain expire. If you&#x27;re a business and you&#x27;re looking to pick up a new domain because it&#x27;s only $10/year, consider that you&#x27;re going to be paying $10/year forever, because once you associate that domain with your business, you can never get rid of that association.</span>

 There is but a simple difference between the standpoint of those collectivists who believe that it is useless to vote to abolish the right of inheritance after having voted &quot;for collective property, and that of those collectivists who think, as do we, that it is useful and even necessary to do so. 
 They place themselves entirely in the future and, taking collective property as their point of departure, discover that there is no longer any good reason to be concerned with the right of inheritance.

Title: Anti-war statement

 We have stated from the very start that the beginning of a full-scale war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 is an imperialist aggression of the Russian state. That is still true. 
Our position on the war in Ukraine
“Autonomous Action” is not on the side of the Ukrainian state — and not on the side of any other state. However, in the current circumstances, the victory of Russia is not beneficial to the peoples of neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor Belarus. Fighting against Russian aggression is now beneficial to everyone except the Kremlin. It is easy to see why it is beneficial to the Ukrainian authorities. But why is it also beneficial to people (and, accordingly…</span>

 Born in 2013, WARZONE DISTRO free zine project, stands at the intersection of nihilist, anti-civilization anarchy, and total liberation, bridging gaps between veganism, straight edge, and insurrectionary thought. WARZONE DISTRO is dedicated to challenging the very foundations of oppression, wherever it festers, and in whatever form. 
 In our interview below, we delve into the radical philosophy driving WARZONE DISTRO, exploring how they blend anarchist and vegan ideals to craft a vision of true total liberation. We talk about the unique ch…</span>

 Along the horridly neglected path out of being commanded and subjected, from the stinking bowels of the societies of oiled gears, permanent emissions, bright screens, information haze and ceaseless masturbation to worn-out sensibility, there arises a shrill hissing of such stupid nature, of such whining entitlement, that the lone rebel catches herself snickering — then nearly dying laughing . . . 
 &quot;You have a left-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a right-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a centrist bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have an extremist bias!&quot;

 “Modernity as a concept means time, the present. There are different moderns, depending on the age. From Sumerian modernity to Roman modernity, and even before and after them, there have been…many examples of modernity.” 
 Abdullah Öcalan, The Sociology of Freedom
 “The Negro’s revolutionary history is rich, inspiring, and unknown. Negroes revolted against the slave raiders in Africa; they revolted against the slave traders on the Atlantic passage. They revolted on the plantations. The docile Negro is a myth… The only place where Negroes did not revolt is in the pages of capitalist historians.”

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursi…</span>

Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.
It pleases me that Bear Blog doesn&#x27;t have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals. In fact, if you look at its roadmap, you will notice that…</span>

Websites are increasing ads to a ridiculous degree because they aren&#x27;t as profitable as they used to be. The first 5 articles on top of Google are garbage created using AI specifically tuned to maximize search engine optimization. 90% of comments on that one review you read are astroturfing accounts trying to sell you something. Youtube still cannot stop the &quot;pu$$y In BIO!!&quot; spam comments.
The bad news everyone figured out is that the internet is getting more chaotic and buckling under the stress of spam and bot accounts running around everywhere. The worse news is that nobody knows what to do about it.
