You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet. That should be a commonplace idea. And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.
It can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits. But how transformative are such programs?

                              <span>Since 1897, Zionism has been the religious and political impetus behind what is now the nation-state of Israel, which, like the United States, is settled on the lives, land, and cultures of millions of Indigenous peoples. Although today’s Israel began as a refuge for European Jews fleeing the Holocaust, Zionism long ago broke out of its moral constraints to become a formidable geopolitical force that demands study. Which is why, in late 2023 America, the Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism was created. And why, because the Institute is fundamentally antizionist, it’s under attack for antisemitism.

                              <span>Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I&#x27;m not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there&#x27;s just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It&#x27;s an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

                              <span>What&#x27;s up?
You made it through the day. I&#x27;m proud of you. Seriously, I&#x27;m so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look forward to anything when you&#x27;re feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you&#x27;ll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll feel better. Someday I&#x27;ll be alright.&quot; Remember, that &quot;someday&quot; comes one day at a time, and you&#x27;ll get there. You will.
I&#x27;m proud of you. I&#x27;m very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

                              <span>Blogging is back and today we have a myriad of great platforms to choose from. This one is hosted on Bear. If you have your own blog and are reading this, chances are that your blog is also a Bear one. 🐻
However, one of the things most of these “indie tools” lack is a search feature. I’ve written a separate post about it: The basic feature blogging platforms lack. 🔎
Well, it looks like things are about to change for us Bear bloggers. I just noticed that Herman&#x27;s blog now has such a feature (can’t recall having seen it before). And it works elegantly. 🤩
Let&#x27;s hope this is something we&#x27;ll all have soon. Thank you in advance, Herman! ✌️
Update: Bear user Yordi made it possible to add your own (example). You can get yours here. Thank you, Yordi! 😎
Update 2: The search results only include links to posts where the search word is included in the title. Hopefully there will come a “true search feature” in the future.</span>

                              <span>Getting my models dunked on by people who can&#x27;t open MS Outlook more than 3 tries out of 5, however, have a remarkable depth and insight into their chosen domain of expertise. It&#x27;s rather humbling.
Collaborating with nontechnical people is oddly my favorite part of doing MLE work right now. It wasn&#x27;t the case when I did basic web/db stuff. They see me as a magician. I see them as voodoo priests and priestesses. When we get something trained up and forecasting that we both like, it&#x27;s super fulfilling. I think for both sides.
Most of my modeling is healthcare related. I tease insights out of a monstrous data lake of claims, Rx, doctor notes, vital signs, diagnostic imagery, etc. What is also monstrous is how accessible this information is. HIPAA my left foot.
Since you seemed to be asking about the temporal realities, it&#x27;s about 3 hours of meetings a week, probably another 3 doing task grooming/preparatory stuff, fixing some ETL problem, or doing a one-off query for the business, the rest is swimming around in the data trying to find a slight edge to forecast something that surprised us for a $million or two using our historical snapshots. It&#x27;s like playing wheres waldo with math. And the waldo scene ends up being about 50TB or so in size. :D</span>

                              <span>Whoops, they did it again. Only this time it was no “tragic mistake.” There were no apologies. Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.

                              <span>Friday nights in New York have an energy about them, one that&#x27;s been easier for me to pick up on after arriving in the city midweek. I&#x27;m not used to it, like a river fish dumped in a tank. Everyone&#x27;s dressed up in skin and mascara and waiting to go to the clubs and even though that life is not for me I love soaking in their anticipation on the subway platforms. Back when I worked abroad in that job I hated I remember writing something about how my soul left my body on Monday mornings and returned on Friday nights. I don&#x27;t miss that feeling one bit, but I do sometimes think about that hunger for life I felt on Friday evenings, that burning desire to avenge the week of my life I sold to live for two days. If I could bottle that joie de vivre and down it everyday, I&#x27;d be unstoppable.
I&#x27;m gett…</span>

                              <span>I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It&#x27;s so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels &quot;less serious&quot;.
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don&#x27;t worry so much about what people think of me. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I&#x27;ve come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can&#x27;t please them all – and that&#x27;s fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It&#x27;s more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

                              <span>Hi, hobbyist here! This is a huge area where government meteorologists and &quot;Big Weather&quot; differ and you can help close that gap!
For context:
The governments of the world provides these big weather companies (weather.com (cough IBM), Accuweather (cough IBM cough), etc) a metric shit ton of their data completely for free (by law) including data transfer. These are things like radar, satellite, ground station data, forecasts, composite models, etc. These companies profit substantially on it, as in billions of dollars. You as citizens also can get this data completely for free as well! MADIS is a system the government is working on to make that data access easier by bringing together many of these systems together and removing the bureaucratic redundancy and abstracting out the aging infrastr…</span>

The hell now is unless you get friends and family or an agency involved to push it and market it it will languish on the 500th page of any Amazon search forever. Oh and did I say that there are thousands of books a day released and there is nowhere you can self-promote stuff if you do not have social media, HN and reddit will also immediately block self-promotion even if relevant to the audience (I guess I can understand why). I guess the only ones destined to read it are the AI training algorithms.
Still it wont stop me writing, having a book published, even if nobody reads it is very self-satisfying and leaves something of you in this world when you are gone.</span>

                              <span>Maybe a bit off-topic, but I sure wish they&#x27;d do this for OneDrive! I installed Windows for personal use for the first time recently (although I use it exclusively at work) and it drove me ABSOLUTELY BONKERS that my home drive was mapping to C:\Users\atribecalledqst\OneDrive.
What I hated the most was that the File Explorer just calls the folders in there e.g. &quot;Documents&quot; and &quot;Pictures&quot; without showing the full path. So it was hard to figure out just where in the file system you were looking -- a major annoyance if you do any work in the command-line!
Even after switching OneDrive off and doing as much as I can to try and get rid of the OneDrive folder structure, I haven&#x27;t been completely successful. You can make some -- but not all -- home folders (like Downloads, Documents, etc.) point directly to their place in the local user folder, but others, particularly Pictures, don&#x27;t seem to be movable. Additionally, some programs still seem to want to use the OneDrive folder by default, like I think Office programs still do their best to use them.
In the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s a small annoyance but god it annoys the shit out of me! I didn&#x27;t ask for cloud backup and it drives me nuts they tried to force it on me!</span>

                              <span>Having written an SSH server that is used in a few larger places, I find the perspective of enabling these features on a per-address basis by default in the future troubling. First, with IPv4 this will have the potential to increasingly penalize innocent bystanders as CGNs are deployed. Worst case, this will give bad actors the option to lock the original owner out of their own server if they have a botnet host in the same network. With IPv6 on the other hand, it is trivially easy to get a new IP, so the protection method described here will be completely ineffective.
From my experiments with several honeypots over a longer period of time, most of these attacks are dumb dictionary attacks. Unless you are using default everything (user, port, password), these attacks don&#x27;t represent a significant threat and more targeted attacks won&#x27;t be caught by this. (Please use SSH keys.)
I have seen experienced sysadmins create the test user with the password of &quot;test&quot; on a live server on port 22 because they were having an &quot;autopilot moment&quot;. It got hacked within 20 minutes of going online and these mechanisms wouldn&#x27;t have saved it, the attacker got in on the second or third try.
If you want to have a read about unsolved problems around SSH that should be addressed, Tatu Ylonen (the inventor of SSH) has written a paper about it in 2019: https://helda.helsinki.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/471f0ff...</span>

                              <span>This looks great.
The authors randomly permute (i.e., shuffle) input tokens in training and add two positional encodings to each token: one with the token&#x27;s position and another with the position of the token to be predicted. Otherwise, the model is a standard autoregressive GPT. The consequences of this seemingly &quot;simple&quot; modification are significant:
* The authors can prompt the trained model with part of a sequence and then decode the missing tokens, all at once, in parallel, regardless of order -- i.e., the model can in-fill in parallel.
* The authors can compute conditional probability densities for every missing token in a sequence, again in parallel, i.e., densities for all missing tokens at once.
* The authors propose a rejection-sampling method for generating in-fill tokens, again in parallel. Their method seems to work well in practice.
I&#x27;ve added this to my reading list. Thank you for sharing it on HN.</span>

                              <span>To avoid a cancellation fee with Adobe, follow these steps:
1. Change Your Current Plan: First, switch your existing Adobe plan to a different one. This is because Adobe offers a 14-day cancellation period for any new plan.
2. Cancel the New Plan: Wait until the next day, then cancel this new plan. Due to the 14-day cancellation policy, you should be able to do this without incurring any fees.
Explanation: Adobe&#x27;s policy allows you to cancel a plan within 14 days of purchase without a penalty. By switching to a new plan and then cancelling it within this window, you effectively bypass any cancellation fees that would apply to your original plan.</span>

&gt; In 2021, Joseph et al. published a paper in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology demonstrating that the entire recorded increase in maternal mortality since 2003 was due to a change in the way data was gathered. In 2003, U.S. states began to include pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates. This led to a whole lot more women who died while pregnant being identified as such. The apparent steady increase in maternal mortality was due to the fact that states adopted this new checkbox at different times:
&gt; In fact, when the authors looked at the common causes of death from pregnancy, they found that these had all declined since 2000, implying that U.S. maternal mortality has actually been falling. Meanwhile, a CDC report in 2020 had found the same thing as Joseph et al. (2021) — maternal mortality rose only in states that added the checkbox to death certificates.</span>

                              <span>Not the submitter, but I installed this a couple days ago to replace Bartender. For those not following along at home, the Bartender author just sold it to some sketchy app mill. It’s an app that legitimately requires screen recording permissions to work. I trusted the old author’s reputation. I have zero trust in the own owner.
Ice isn’t as good yet. It’s not nearly so configurable. For example, you can either hide all icons or none. You can’t decide to show some of them all the time. That’s a bummer. I’ll still happily accept that trade off to replace Bartender, which I’d previously purchased several versions of. It’s dead to me.
Great job so far, Ice. I hope you keep improving!</span>

Rasha was simply going about her day. She owned a beauty salon in Majd Al-Krum, a town in the Galilee. She was running routine errands when Israeli police pulled her over. Rasha is tall and elegant. She has the face of a model and long, shimmering black hair. She was wearing a sleek black dress. She tried to maintain her composure as Israeli police swarmed around her. There is a look of confusion and then a flash of fear on her face as she is told she’s being arrested.  More

                              <span>The neoliberal attack on government expenditure in poorer countries was a key driver of international migration. Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy. More

But I am pointing out that while New York State court has jurisdiction over convicted felon Trump, the judge has both the right and the obligation—before issuing a sentence—to find out if the defendant has understood the charges that were brought against him.

                              <span>The problem may have more to do with Uganda and having a surveillance state than it has to do with National ID cards.
Most European countries have them and they are as uncontroversial as passports.
Countries without national ID cards are not especially more privacy minded : for the purpose of identity verification they just use alternative documents &amp; processes that are less straightforward and at least as intrusive (e.g. driving licenses, utility bills and credit checks in the US and UK).
IMO it&#x27;s much more honest to recognize that there&#x27;s a legitimate need to be able to prove one&#x27;s identity in a functioning society, and to build a dedicated system for that, instead of tying your existence as a citizen to your ability / willingness to drive a large piece of metal around.</span>

&quot;We currently don&#x27;t understand how to make sense of the neural activity within language models.&quot;
&quot;Unlike with most human creations, we don’t really understand the inner workings of neural networks.&quot;
&quot;The [..] networks are not well understood and cannot be easily decomposed into identifiable parts&quot;
&quot;[..] the neural activations inside a language model activate with unpredictable patterns, seemingly representing many concepts simultaneously&quot;
&quot;Learning a large number of sparse features is challenging, and past work has not been shown to scale well.&quot;
etc., etc., etc.
People say we don&#x27;t (currently) know why they output what they output, because .. as the article clearly states, we don&#x27;t.</span>

                              <span>The &#x27;worst&#x27; thing about watching space launches on streams is that you simply cannot grasp how ridiculously huge these things are. Even if, like in the stream today, you see a water tower for some scale, the size discrepancies just make it so hard to intuit. Starship is 121 meters high. That&#x27;s something taller than a football field, jetting off into space! I&#x27;ve only gotten to see a decommissioned Space Shuttle in person, but that was also amazing. Even its fuel tank [1] makes you feel just tiny, yet it&#x27;s merely 47m. Getting to see Starship live would be such an amazing opportunity.

                              <span>&gt; There&#x27;s clearly a gap between imaginary noble okupas addressing housing crisis via occupation of unused bank property and reality of weed smoking anarchists and their collaborating deoccupying mafia harassing mostly not-so-rich middle class, who can&#x27;t afford the security measures the rich can.
I had a friend who bought a house that needed a lot of work. Before he could get started on the remodel, someone broke in to the empty house, changed the locks, and started occupying it.
I remember being shocked that someone could do this and be protected under the law. He had to follow a formal eviction process, even though they broke into his house and never had any agreement. The perpetrators were known to the police as professional squatters and they advised him on all the things to avoid doing so they wouldn’t countersue him, which was mind blowing.
Even weirder was to watch the reaction on his social media when he posted the story. A lot of people, including many of his friends, jumped to defending squatter’s rights or trying to make some broader point about inequality.
There’s something about squatting that appeals to people who think it’s always a RobinHood situation: Stealing from the rich, giving to the poor. It’s more fun to imagine these people as noble warriors against an unjust society, rather than seem them as people abusing the laws for personal gain at the expense of random victims. Even here on HN there are comments trying to downplay the issue by portraying the victims as mostly wealthy or landlords, which are presumably acceptable victims to people who like these kind of narratives.</span>

                              <span>I think there are qualitative differences that arise from incremental, quantitative changes in privacy.
Sure, in the 1970s the cops could follow you around any time you were out in public. But they needed 6+ cops to provide round-the-clock surveillance, with an annual cost in the high six figures.
So the average citizen&#x27;s privacy was protected not by law or high-minded ideals about privacy, but by simple numbers. There weren&#x27;t enough cops to follow even 0.1% of the population.
But in the modern age of smartphones and license plate recognition and credit reference agencies? I think there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that we need new laws and new rights to reflect the new reality, where tracking people around the clock is several orders of magnitude cheaper.</span>

                              <span>The rate of descent is absolutely astonishing, 8km -&gt; 1km in 20 seconds, then just hovers above the water. Absolutely incredible work by the SpaceX team.
Living in central Florida I cannot wait for the new launch facility to come online. We&#x27;re going to have lines of spectators into the space coast like we did for the shuttle.
If any of you are heading to Disney World you should stop by the NASA Kennedy Visitor Complex, it is so well done and not that expensive (it takes less time than 1 line at Disney world to get to :) ). It has the original launch control room for Apollo that you can tour, a Saturn V rocket that is laid horizontally and you can walk under, the crew module for the moon landing.  My favorite part is the Atlantis shuttle suspended from the ceiling, they left it in its &quot;raw&quot; landed format with scorch marks and tiles, it looks absolutely amazing.</span>

                              <span>Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They&#x27;re all pretty great!

And as we witness the televised genocide of the Palestinian people, it appears that the international system of liberal governance seems to be collapsing like a house of cards.

first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash
and markdown kicked off the project we have today. Who could have predicted that 10 years later,
Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn&#x27;t just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the
7M+ Developers,
and the even larger user community that have all hel…</span>

                              <span>The point of this blog was to put myself out there. Why? I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don&#x27;t get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!</span>

                              <span>It’s not new that the promise of artificial intelligence capable of helping us and solving a series of problems we don&#x27;t have has emerged. However, it is only from 2022 onwards that large models (LLM, LAM, and others) are gaining traction and attention worldwide. It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana&#x27;s AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane&#x27;s brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and &quot;pay-to-win&quot; games (which use NFTs). Most of the instructions are hardcoded into the device, meaning that most actions are predefined acc…</span>

                              <span>Vegetating aside, the last few days before big moves usually also brings lots of appointments. This week I get my teeth cleaned and eyes checked before I leave, scheduling follow-ups in a year and making plans to be back for them.
Going to these appointments is one of the few activities I actually prefer my parents come along. Not because I enjoy their company (it&#x27;s hit or miss), but because I&#x27;m no good at doing the things they usually do. (And by &#x27;they&#x27; I mean my mom.)
Today before I leave for the optometrist Mom tells me I shouldn&#x27;t agree to pay more than $110 for my visit, the same amount we paid last year. Upon arrival, the receptionist informs me that the fee for checkups is $250 now. $250? I thought it was supposed to be $110, I say. She shows me a packet with the price printed in bo…</span>

                              <span>Everything is dependent on feedback loops. Video games/reels have short exciting feedback loops. That is why they are so addictive. Real life often has long feedback loops. Anything you do, it will take time to see the results.
You will have to grind hard at something and for a sufficiently long amount of time to achieve something meaningful. Yet if your brain is trained to enjoy short feedback loops it becomes hard to do something for long without seeing exciting results.
You either train yourself to enjoy long feedback loops or you shorten the loop through regular rewards. Maybe break down the huge task into small chunks.
It is often good to run both a long and short feedback loop on a task. The long loop keeps you aware of the bigger picture so the setbacks don&#x27;t seem as bad. The short loop keeps you on track and gives that constant nudge in the right direction.
You are already in a feedback loop whether you are aware of it or not. Better off being in a feedback loop that helps you grow. One of your own making.</span>

                              <span>My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.</span>

It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…</span>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.</span>
