                              <span>It wasn’t Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s finest moment. But it was one of them. It was a critical moment in 1987 when he and the daughter of a president protested against the presence of the CIA and CIA recruitment on the campus of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Abbie was 50. Amy was less than half his age. Together, they spanned the generation gap that sprawled across much of the 1980s. The daughter of a president and the co-founder of the Yippies and one of the eight defendants at the Chicago Conspiracy Trial showed that the American spirit of defiance had not evaporated into the thin air of the Reagan years. Nationally acclaimed lawyer, Lenny Weinglass, came out of semi-retirement and led the defense team for Amy and Abbie. More

                              <span>The concept of gravastars (or gravitational vacuum stars) is a fascinating alternative to the idea of black holes, although if their presence were ever proved, they would not rule out the existence of black holes. Proposed by Pawel O. Mazur and Emil Mottola some twenty years ago, these objects are consistent with Albert Einstein’s general […]</span>

                              <span>Hilarious irony:
&gt; With hindsight, some of my past rejections have become amusing.  With a coauthor, I once almost solved a conjecture, establishing the result with an &quot;epsilon loss&quot; in a key parameter.  We submitted to a highly reputable journal, but it was rejected on the grounds that it did not resolve the full conjecture.  So we submitted elsewhere, and the paper was accepted.
&gt; The following year, we managed to finally prove the full conjecture without the epsilon loss, and decided to try submitting to the highly reputable journal again.  This time, the paper was rejected for only being an epsilon improvement over the previous literature!</span>

It’s a twist on the Alger myth, inspiring to youth: you too can get to murder Filipinos, or Palestinians, or  Vietnamese or Afghans  and still  win a Peace Prize.

In the last year the number of homeless individuals in America shot up an astounding 18%, bringing the number of Americans without a home to 770,000. Of course, this number is probably a distinct underestimation as it is difficult to properly include the souls out there without reliable housing, or of course those who are still sheltered, but barely existing on a shoestring, juggling numerous jobs and falling behind daily.

                              <span>In April 2019, Jimmy Carter told his church congregation in Georgia that President Trump had called him for advice about China. Carter said he told Trump that China was economically overtaking the United States as the world’s largest and most dynamic economy because the United States had spent decades wasting trillions of dollars to fight endless wars, while China had instead focused on economic development and lifted hundreds of millions of its people out of extreme poverty. “China has not wasted a single penny on war,” Carter said, “and that’s why they’re ahead of us, in almost every way.” More

                              <span>In liberal, Jewish households, Hanukkah has always been something of an embarrassment. First, there’s the unavoidable truth that Hannukah is no match for Christmas. Liturgically speaking, it’s a minor holiday; it ranks somewhere between Simchat Torah and Tu Bishvat, neither of which most Gentiles (and many Jews) have even heard of. So, efforts by assimilated Jews since the 19th century, and especially the 1950s, to treat Hanukkah like Christmas are a stretch. The birthday of God (even if you are a non-believer) in 1 CE is objectively speaking a much bigger deal than the re-dedication by the victorious Maccabees (Judean rebels) of the second temple of Jerusalem (long since destroyed) in the 2nd century BCE.

                              <span>&gt; Credit card delinquency rates, which are seen as a precursor to write-offs, peaked in July, according to data from Moody’s, but have only fallen slightly and remain nearly a percentage point higher than they were on average in the year before the pandemic.
This is a prime example of a style of reporting that really grinds my gears.
The citation is clearly to another internet source, so a link should be provided. If it truly cannot be linked because it is private, more context is still needed to understand what this data means.
I actually can’t find the source myself, but I can find “Delinquency Rate on Credit Card Loans, All Commercial Banks” from the Federal Reserve. [1]
The percents from that source somewhat match those referenced in the FT quote. “Peaked in July”
- 2024Q1 3.15%
- 2024Q2 3.24%
- 2024Q3 3.23%
Using 2019 as “the year before the pandemic”, the average was 2.5825. Is +0.6475 “nearly a percentage point”? I guess it technically would round up.
Seemingly important context that the quote doesn’t give is that 3.23% is lower than any time 1991Q3 to 2011Q4. But, maybe the trend matters more for this metric.

                              <span>I worked with John for a few years in the 1990s. This was during the heyday of BBSes, when he joined our small team at Mustang Software after Mustang bought Qmodem. John moved to Bakersfield California (with his family, including OP!) to be with us. John left a few years later due to I think business differences with management.
John was personable and full of joy. He always loved a good joke. I remember the parties (not wild, we were pretty tame back then) we would have around the pool at his place. He was generous with his time.
The story of Qmodem itself was a bit different. Qmodem for DOS was a one-man shareware business and was John&#x27;s pride and joy. It was clear that he poured everything into that program. It was finely tuned and just worked. Times were changing though, and people were calling for a Windows version. Unfortunately, John was not interested in learning Windows programming, so Scott Hunter (now at Microsoft), Dan Horn, and I built Qmodem for Windows. It was good, but it really never had the same level of polish that John&#x27;s work did. It was &quot;Qmodem&quot; in name only.
After John left Mustang he also left Bakersfield and I lost touch with him. I&#x27;m sure he continued to make the people around him smile. Thank you for your time and contributions, John.</span>

It seems a bit naive for some reason and doesn&#x27;t do performance back-off the way I would expect from Google Bot.  It just kept repeatedly requesting more and more until my server crashed, then it would back off for a minute and then request more again.
My solution was to add a Cloudflare rule to block requests from their User-Agent.  I also added more nofollow rules to links and a robots.txt but those are just suggestions and some bots seem to ignore them.
Cloudflare also has a feature to block known AI bots and even suspected AI bots: https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-blo... As much as I dislike Cloudflare centralization, this was a super convenient feature.</span>

This is now a peer-reviewed paper, published last month in Cell [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01091-2].
Obelisks are part of a larger research program we&#x27;re developing at the University of Toronto + collaborators, see also: Virus-Viroid Hybrids paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38301-2] and the Zeta-Elements [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04332-2].
Computational biology is driving a revolutionary expansion of our understanding of Earth&#x27;s biodiversity. I believe Zeta-elements, Ambiviruses, and Obelisks are just the beginning. If you&#x27;re interested, our &quot;Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms&quot; (University of Toronto) is hiring passionate developers/post-docs/graduate students [https://www.rnalab.ca].
Edit: OK going to call it for now. I&#x27;ll check in later today if there&#x27;s any outstanding questions.</span>

                              <span>&gt; SQLite is not open source in the legal sense, as “open source” has a specific definition and requires licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
This is wrong, and harmfully wrong. OSI are not the arbiters of open source. Their Open Source Definition, though generally useful and accepted, is not without legitimate criticism and controversy. As for their approval, that’s a dreadful thing to rely on for any purpose; https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/05/05/Rely-on-OSI.html&gt; is a good description of most of what’s wrong with it (it doesn’t really get into the broken politics enough; but some of his other articles contain more), and I like its summary: “The list of OSI-approved licenses reflects OSI’s practical and political history, not any useful, consistently functional category of license terms.”
As for whether SQLite is open source, well, the only reason a public domain dedication doesn’t meet the OSD is that it’s not a license. It’s more open. In a way that is legally mildly uncertain in some jurisdictions, sure, but to call it “not open source in the legal sense” is just wrong.</span>

                              <span>In some parallel universe, each computing device manufacturer is required by law to provide a storage so that the user can plug in their single, universal, transferrable set of security credentials (like passkeys). Instead of &quot;many cooks&quot; mentioned in the article, there is one standard.
I cannot bring myself to agree to any &quot;switch to passkey&quot; prompt from any device because I have no idea (and too tired to figure out) how and where that key will be stored, how do I deal with different devices, etc. I already have a universal solution for credentials: 1password, which is cross-platform. With Apple&#x27;s keychain, and I suspect other companies&#x27; solutions, passkeys are connected to your account and at best synced between devices from the same manufacturer. But even with Apple, I can&#x27;t sync stuff between my personal and work computer because they use different Apple IDs, even though the underlying true identity (me) is the same.
Like with many other solutions, the current approach with passkeys is designed for an imaginary &quot;user in vacuum&quot; model each company dreams about, where people are 100% into one ecosystem, forever.</span>

                              <span>A pious Sunday school teacher confessing to lust in his heart but swearing never to lie, he came to Washington to reestablish public faith in government just when popular disgust at monstrous U.S. crimes in Indochina had reached unprecedented heights. The big business agenda during his term in office (1977-1981) was to roll back the welfare state, break the power of unions, fan the flames of the Cold War to increase military spending, engineer tax breaks for wealthy corporate interests, and repeal government regulation of business. While portraying himself as a peanut-farming populist, Carter delivered the goods for Wall Street.

I believe if he got re-elected in 1980, the US would be in a much better place.  One thing, it could be argued real work on Climate Change would have begun in 1981 as opposed to where we are now, which is just watching the average probably blowing past 3C in around 70 years from now.
For his loss in 1980, I still blame Kennedy.
RIP, he did a lot to help regular people through his life, far more than our current crop of politicians.</span>

                              <span>What I want is very simple: I want software that doesn&#x27;t send anything to the Internet without some explicit intent first. All of that work to try to make this feature plausibly private is cool engineering work, and there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with implementing a feature like this, but it should absolutely be opt-in.
Trust in software will continue to erode until software stops treating end users and their data and resources (e.g. network connections) as the vendor&#x27;s own playground. Local on-device data shouldn&#x27;t be leaking out of radio interfaces unexpectedly, period. There should be a user intent tied to any feature where local data is sent out to the network.
So why didn&#x27;t Apple just simply ask for user permission to enable this feature? My cynical opinion is because Apple knows some portion of users would instantly disallow this if prompted, but they feel they know better than those users. I don&#x27;t like this attitude, and I suspect it is the same reason why there is an increasing discontent growing towards opt-out telemetry, too.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeing a lot of back in forth in the comments between hiring managers and employees discussing who is more responsible for the current situation, but from the perspective of someone looking for a job what should I be doing?
I&#x27;ve been pretty aggressively looking for a job for the past six months or so. I have 10+ years of professional software dev experience so I&#x27;ve mostly been looking at senior dev positions. I haven&#x27;t used LLMs at all in my resume, cover letters, etc. I only apply to jobs that I believe I meet the requirements for and that I would likely accept if given an offer. How do I signal that 1) I am a real person 2) I really do have the job experience and skills listed on my resume, and 3) I really am interested in the specific job I&#x27;m applying for. Because doing this my hit rate has been abysmal. I&#x27;ve had maybe 10-12 initial phone screens (never an issue, I easily make it past these). Past that I&#x27;ve had maybe 3-4 interviews that get into the later rounds. From that I&#x27;ve had zero offers.
So why should I keep doing what I&#x27;m doing when it&#x27;s getting me nowhere? Why shouldn&#x27;t I switch to an automated &quot;shotgun&quot; approach that applies me to as many jobs as possible to which I vaguely fit the requirements? The only other way I&#x27;ve seen suggested to signal that I&#x27;m a real person with real experience is to know someone in the company who can vouch for me (which I almost never do).</span>

                              <span>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand most of the technical details of Apple&#x27;s blog post&quot;
I do:
- Client side vectorization: the photo is processed locally, preparing a non-reversible vector representation before sending (think semantic hash).
- Differential privacy: a decent amount of noise is added the the vector before sending it. Enough to make it impossible to reverse lookup the vector. The noise level here is ε &#x3D; 0.8, which is quite good privacy.
- OHTTP relay: it&#x27;s sent through a 3rd party so Apple never knows your IP address. The contents are encrypted so the 3rd party never doesn&#x27;t learn anything either (some risk of exposing &quot;IP X is an apple photos user&quot;, but nothing about the content of the library).
- Homomorphic encryption: The lookup work is performed on server with encrypted data. Apple can&#x27;t decrypt the vector contents, or response contents. Only the client can decrypt the result of the lookup.
This is what a good privacy story looks like. Multiple levels of privacy security, when any one of the latter 3 should be enough alone to protect privacy.
&quot;It ought to be up to the individual user to decide their own tolerance for the risk of privacy violations.&quot; -&gt; The author themselves looks to be an Apple security researcher, and are saying they can&#x27;t make an informed choice here.
I&#x27;m not sure what the right call is here. But the conclusion &quot;Thus, the only way to guarantee computing privacy is to not send data off the device.&quot; isn&#x27;t true. There are other tools to provide privacy (DP, homomorphic encryption), while also using services. They are immensely complicated, and user&#x27;s can&#x27;t realistically evaluate risk. But if you want features that require larger-than-disk datasets, or frequently changing content, you need tools like this.</span>

                              <span>Maybe not your company, but it seems hiring companies brought this upon themselves with immediate AI rejects of qualified candidates, ghost jobs, ghosting candidates after interview, etc, etc.
If it takes a qualified candidate 100&#x27;s of applications to land a single interview, then can you blame someone for automating it? I&#x27;d say that having the initiative and ability to automate it well would make this guy a great hire, if he hadn&#x27;t already found a job!</span>

                              <span>Just to clarify on the facts, as gathered from reddit threads:
He wasn&#x27;t trying to protest the dress code or make a scene, it wasn&#x27;t on his mind at all.  He had been out for an appearance with a sponsor during a break, then came back to the venue for the next round, and didn&#x27;t notice that he was wearing jeans and it didn&#x27;t cross his mind that that would be a violation.
Then he was told to change, and there wasn&#x27;t enough time for him to go do that before the upcoming round.  He thought he was told he could do it either after that round or for the next day, but then was told he would be excluded from that round, and at that point he said f--- it and withdrew entirely.
The controversy was about exactly how the penalty is imposed.  The rule is a fine for the first violation and disqualification for multiple.  It wasn&#x27;t clear if his appearance for the day would count as one violation (so he could just incur the fine and wear correct clothing tomorrow), or if each round would be a separate violation.  It also wasn&#x27;t clear if he could play while in violation or would be excluded from each round until he changed.  Precedent from other events wasn&#x27;t clear for either of these.
The headline of &quot;disqualified&quot; is wrong and did not happen - he chose to withdraw.</span>

                              <span>&gt; we need to be serious about our adversary that keeps threatening to nuke major European cities off the map
Europe clings to the hope that the rules-based international order that—at this point—everyone is abandoning, can be resuscitated through hopes and prayers. It can’t. We’re back to realpolitik.
Russian boats should be subject to boarding and searching when passing by Finnish and adjacent waters; for precedent, they can cite China claiming its sovereign waters include vastly adjacent waters to its own.
Russia flirted with Turkish airspace in 2015; Ankara shot it down [1]. Zero further provocations. You can’t appease a bully by lying prostrate. Even if the bully has big guns at home. We aren’t risking nuclear war by drawing clear lines, we’re inviting it by clumsily blurring them.

                              <span>There are significant downsides to the digitalization of travel documents. The biggest one I can think of is ownership - the UK is moving to an entirely digital visa system and bringing in an ESTA style system called ETA for visa free countries. Unfortunately this means that residency cards for noncitizens are being phased out. This means that when the Home Office messes up and accidentally deletes your immigration status, or you are at an airport with no internet access, you have no evidence whatsoever of what status you hold. It also means you will no longer be in possession of any records that might be useful years in the future when the current database containing immigration records will likely have been replaced. It’s much easier to keep a piece of paper around for 30+ years than it is to make sure a digital record doesn’t rot in that time.
I feel strongly that any future digital travel credentials that are offered by governments should be able to operate entirely offline, and provide records that can be retained by the data subject. That means that revocation is harder, but IMO that’s a tradeoff that is worth making to avoid another Windrush scandal.
This has already become a pain when dealing with countries that don’t stamp passports, because when you need to apply for something that asks for your travel history over the past 10 years, you might not have any records anymore.</span>

                              <span>Coming from a Latin American the idea of re-starting your life across the country for college and then again for work (multiple times sometimes) while away from family and friends is very foreign.
A lot of the conversation around modern American youth feeling isolated, lacking socialization and not building strong relationships seems that stem from this drive.
Another thing that’s really weird and related is another recurring theme in the American ethos: the cultural shame that comes with living “at home” or staying in the same small town for your whole life. Somehow they made it so living close to your family and friends for your 20s-30s  and maybe forever means you’re a “loser”.</span>
