                              <span>Sometimes I get tired of formulating words to help things make sense. At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.
I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

Title: Thoughts During Imprisonment
Date: Oct 26, 1909
Source: Nihon Rekishi Issue 131 (1951)

 It is government suppression. It is tyranny. 
 Even until now, I am unable to give a viewpoint on whether the ending of a human life is a good or bad thing, regardless of someone giving me a good or bad name for it. Daring to be brief about whether or not to end a human life, I am neither for nor against either choice, because I am for the sake of everybody’s happiness, with an unshakeable faith to stand on the impossible conviction of working for the freedom of any or even all people. 
 I wish that I will behave in accordance with the demands of reason and not based on the demands of immediate emotions or instincts based on material desire. If this course of action is in a…</span>

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m living in a different universe sometimes. The consensus on HN seems to be that you can be pretty productive with LLMs as coding assistants, but every time I try I find it borderline impossible to get functional code even for pretty straightforward prompts.
I decided to fire up GPT-4o again today to see if maybe things have gotten better over the past few months.
I asked GPT to write code to render a triangle using Vulkan (a 3D graphics API). There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4&#x27;s training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it&#x27;s not a simple case of copy/paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)
Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:
GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer. So that&#x27;s a guaranteed memory access violation right off the bat.</span>

                              <span>I literally got a pointless noncompete removed from a contract just because of the FTC announcement.
The proposed noncompete had a 10-year lockup for a freelance contract…obviously nonsense. But it was so helpful to say “these aren’t sticking around so let’s just cut it out.”
These changes make a big difference in encouraging entrepreneurs and helping our economy, as well as just reducing stress for a lot of people.</span>

                              <span>The key thing to understand here is the exfiltration vector.
Slack can render Markdown links, where the URL is hidden behind the text of that link.
In this case the attacker tricks Slack AI into showing a user a link that says something like &quot;click here to reauthenticate&quot; - the URL attached to that link goes to the attacker&#x27;s server, with a query string that includes private information that was visible to Slack AI as part of the context it has access to.
If the user falls for the trick and clicks the link, the data will be exfiltrated to the attacker&#x27;s server logs.
Here&#x27;s my attempt at explaining this attack: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/20/data-exfiltration-from...</span>

                              <span>Working as a SRE for a year in a large global company broke me out of this &quot;panic&quot; mode described in this post. To a business, every problem seems like a world-ending event. It&#x27;s very easy to give in to panic in those situations. However, in reality, it&#x27;s rarely that bad, and even if it is, you&#x27;ll probably survive without harm. The key in these situations, and what I try to do (totally relate to breaking out in a sweat, that still happens to me, just happened yesterday) is to take 5-10 minutes before doing any action to try to fix it and sketch it out, think about it as clearly as you can. Fear interferes with your ability to reason rationally. Mashing buttons in a panic can make your problems spiral even worse (seen that happen). Disrupting that fear circuit any way you can is important. Splashing my face and hands with extremely cold water is my trick.
Then after you go through a few of these, you&#x27;ll realize it really isn&#x27;t too bad and you&#x27;ve dealt with bad situations before and you&#x27;ll gain the confidence to know you can deal with it, even when there&#x27;s no one you can reach out to for help.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not convinced. Most of the argument seems to be that redundant UX is bad UX:
&gt; But by archiving the email, the email disappears from the list, which already implies the action was successful.
&gt; In this example, the button already includes a confirmation so the toast is entirely unnecessary.
I vehemently disagree with the idea that just because you&#x27;re already communicating something one way it&#x27;s bad UX to include another way of communicating the same thing at the same time. Redundancy in communication is a feature, not a bug, and it&#x27;s present in all human languages. It ensures that even in less than ideal conditions the message still gets through.
In the case of toasts, having a single, standardized way of communicating the status of all actions (and if possible providing the undo) allows a user to quickly pick up on the pattern. Extra indicators closer to the action can be valuable too, but it&#x27;s when they&#x27;re paired with the toast that their meaning becomes entirely clear.  To remove the toast in favor of a bunch of specific indicators is to force your user to learn several different ways of saying &quot;it&#x27;s done now&quot; entirely from context (many of which will be small and subtle as in the examples given). This might work fine for you and me but isn&#x27;t great for, say, the elderly or the vision impaired or children.
Unless they&#x27;re actually getting in the way, toasts aren&#x27;t bad UX, they&#x27;re redundant UX, and a UX designer shouldn&#x27;t be striving to optimize away redundancy.</span>

                              <span>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet&#x27;s cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn&#x27;t new
enough to have support for this feature.</span>

                              <span>The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

                              <span>Today I realised this would be my 96th post here, on my Bear blog. And that&#x27;s just from somewhere from the first week of April. I&#x27;m nearing that magic 100 posts. Though, of course, as is typical, I only started the 100DaysToOffload challenge half way through and am only on post 48 of the challenge itself. But hey, that&#x27;s okay.
I know I can be a prolific writer and love to talk about everything and anything. You can thank my family and a lack of TV in our house till much later than everyone else on the planet, for that. I can thank my parents for an inquisitive nature, an appetite for reading anything with print on it, and a love of science and nature, and the physical world around us. Funny how growing up without smart devices, TV, and only access to museums and libraries shaped who I am.

                              <span>&quot;What&#x27;s the secret?&quot;
I asked this question to one of my clients today. He was 85 years old, looked 60, and was as fit and agile as a 50-year-old.
He replied: &quot;There&#x27;s no secret. I enjoy walking. That’s all.&quot;
No secrets. No tricks. Completely natural.
But that&#x27;s often how it is, isn’t it; we think there&#x27;s a code to crack, a secret recipe to follow to achieve success. When in reality, the answer lies in the most natural thing in the world.
If we want to increase our chances of being in good shape, then we need to make sure we move around a bit. If we want to become a better writer, then we need to make sure we write a lot.
There&#x27;s no secret.</span>

                              <span>I’m currently outside, having a smoking break.
I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

Around 2AM this morning I had a realization that this was the most stressed I have ever been. On verge of a complete breakdown.
Why? Because I noticed around 10PM that jumpcomedy.com was entirely broken with all HTTP POST calls made by RTK Query failing. Nothing worked and though I had deployed recent changes, none of them would cause this. I was at a complete loss as to where to look, especially as this is working locally. Posting on the usual Discords (NextJS, Vercel) is leading to dead silence. I&#x27;m alone and have to fix this issue which I didn&#x27;t cause.
This isn&#x27;t the first production defect I&#x27;ve introduced in my 25 years of working, but this is the first one where I had absolutely nobody to turn to in a time of crisis while customer complaints are pilin…</span>

                              <span>I no longer want to simply be a developer, an artist, or a sporty person. I’ve changed my mindset:
from &quot;I want to be a developer&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who enjoys tinkering with coding and tech every day,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be an artist&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who appreciates and creates art,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be a runner&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who loves running and taking walks.&quot;
This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.
I remind myself that becoming is a lifelong journey that never truly ends. We never completely become anything; we are always in the process of becoming. So, there’s no point in fixating on final results.
Just enjoy the path, stay on the path, and keep becoming.</span>

However, “rapid” credit expansions do not always end well and have been shown in the academic literature to predict adverse real outcomes such as lower GDP growth and an increased likelihood of crises.

instead of SPDY for streaming.
This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs
matter.
Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that&#x27;s bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create
a shell in a running container from your local…</span>

Sure, you&#x27;ve learned. You might have explored a topic you&#x27;re curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: &quot;all the time!&quot;
Please, re-read the question.
I didn&#x27;t ask when was the last time you learned something new. I&#x27;m talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.
Maybe I&#x27;m alone in this feeling, but it&#x27;s been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.
That&#x27;s why, from now on, I&#x27;m going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.
I&#x27;m currently working on my syllabus, which I&#x27;ll gladly share with you once I&#x27;ve finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other&#x27;s schedules).
Take a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.
I can&#x27;t wait to learn with you all.</span>

My parents did this all the time while I was growing up, so much so that I ended up believing it. And sometimes, it&#x27;s true. It could be that &quot;that person&quot; is not being mean to me because they don&#x27;t like me, but rather because they&#x27;re having a bad day in general.

                              <span>&gt; In the Netherlands alone, these solar panels generate a power output equivalent to at least 25 medium sized nuclear power plants.
Since this didn&#x27;t pass the smell test: the author is looking at nameplate capacity, which is a completely useless metric for variable electricity production sources (a solar panel in my sunless basement has the same nameplate capacity as the same panel installed in the Sahara desert).
Looking at actual yearly energy generation data, this is more like 1.5 times the generation of an average nuclear power plant (NL solar production in 2023: 21TWh, US nuclear production in 2021: 778TWh by 54 plants).
Which maybe puts more into perspective the actual risks involved here. I&#x27;m not saying there shouldn&#x27;t be more regulations and significantly better security practices, but otoh you could likely drive a big truck into the right power poles and cause a similar sized outage.</span>

                              <span>My kiddo has easily spent 500+ on Roblox across birthday/Xmas gift cards/chores.
I can&#x27;t stand that almost all of the games seem to have a pay to win aspect, or are heavily advertising every chance they get.
As a gamer dad, I try to show my kid better games to play, but because they aren&#x27;t free, his friends can&#x27;t play. Just drives him to keep playing and wanting more Robux. It&#x27;s compounded when his favorite Youtubers play...
Seriously don&#x27;t understand how Roblox isn&#x27;t being investigated for predatory practices. I imagine they can hide behind the fact users are making most of the mini games, and they are just providing a platform.</span>

                              <span>I came to this same conclusion some years ago while working on a side project.
Before anything LLM existed, I built a site[0] to generate fake &quot;AWS Blog Posts.&quot;  I trained a markov chain generator on all AWS announcement posts up to that point, copied the html + css of aws&#x27;s standard blog posts, then glued them all together with some python + JS.  It turned out, IMO, pretty funny!  People familiar with AWS&#x27;s blog posts would often get several sentences in before they realized they were looking at word-soup.
When GPT was new, I looked into using that to &quot;upgrade&quot; it.  I spent a weekend messing around with Minimaxir&#x27;s gpt-2-simple generating blog posts based on AWS content.  What I found was, ultimately, it was way less fun.  The posts were far too realistic to be interesting.  They read like totally-real blog posts that just happened to not be true.
I realized then that the humor of those early markov generations was the ridiculousness.  The point where, a few words or sentences in, you realized it was all nonsense.  LLM&#x27;s these days are too good for that - the text they generate is sometimes wrong, but rarely nonsense in a humorous way.
Markov chain content was wrong in a &quot;kid&#x27;s say the darndest things&quot; way, while modern LLMs are wrong in a &quot;My uncle doesn&#x27;t know basic geography&quot; way.

                              <span>&gt; Unlike other social platforms, Roblox’s revenue is nearly all via user spending rather than advertising. As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.
Wow. I&#x27;ve never though about this before, but this is an awful second-order consequence of the high app store fees set by Apple and Google. It essentially incentivizes App makers to treat users as products not customers!
(Not too surprising for Google, but certainly goes against Apple&#x27;s public stance).</span>

                              <span>&gt; Though Roblox isn’t profitable, there are some significant caveats to the situation. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow—a far more important measure than accounting-defined profits—were $650MM, about 20% of revenue. Roblox has been cash-positive for at least twenty-four quarters.
This feels like an example of the phenomenon highlighted in another recent post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;41263855
Namely, that as long as Roblox&#x27;s cash flow is increasing year-over-year, they probably don&#x27;t care about profit. (And if cash flow ever does stop increasing, they can always get back to sustainability by pumping the brakes on reinvestment spending.)</span>

Then I was told I had to submit fingerprints and sign a letter promising I wasnt going to do drugs and I refused.
Finally a month later they sent me a letter saying I had forfeited the money and I showed up again (took a day off work) and they said I had to go to court.  So I went to court, and the judge spent ten minutes telling the cops that didnt show up I had to get my money back.
Next month after that I got a call saying I had property to pick up and that I&#x27;d be fined daily if I didnt.  So I got the money back.</span>

                              <span>I initially loved Zed.
But as their focus has shifted to building Collaboration &amp; AI features, and still haven’t yet nailed just being a good/great base editor, its become less useful to me.
I still have a lot of hope for Zed.
But for the time being, I’ve switched back to my old editor &amp; IDE … and I’ll try Zed again at a much later date.</span>

                              <span>This is a well-intentioned but largely useless ruling because it fails to define the maximum duration for which property can be held. As such, it&#x27;s up to the police as to what qualifies as indefinite. If the ruling had capped it to 14 or 30 days, that would be a useful ruling.
A hard time cap is essential because one&#x27;s life too has a cap. The amount of time for which one can go without earning a livelihood also has a cap. Imagine if prison sentences didn&#x27;t have a time cap.
This illustrates a common problem with our laws. They&#x27;re very often vaguely defined, needlessly so, in a way that keeps attorneys and judges very rich, and the police abusive, to the detriment of the individual. In a sensible world, the laws would all be rewritten for clarity and consistency, starting with the Constitution.</span>

1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.
About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&#x27;re willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
This becomes particularly problematic when running large-sc…</span>

 Vouching means different things to different anarchists. For some, to vouch for a person means the vouchee is felt to be trustworthy and competent enough for an action. For others, vouching means that the voucher has concrete evidence of the trustworthiness and competence of the vouchee, and is willing to stake their reputation on that evidence. 
 To agree on whether to vouch for someone or not, we need to be clear about what we mean by vouching. We propose three components of a vouch that might be helpful in discussing that meaning: trustworthiness, competence, and the voucher&#x27;s reput…</span>

                              <span>A close friend of mine recently landed a new job and is now considering quitting.
It&#x27;s impossible to predict whether you&#x27;ll enjoy a workplace, but it usually becomes apparent soon after starting. If you consistently feel like &quot;this is the wrong place for me,&quot; I strongly believe you should quit as soon as possible. I&#x27;ve personally quit jobs within the first week.
Given that work occupies a significant portion of our lives, it&#x27;s crucial that it feels right. But the very fact that work constitutes a large part of our lives can also mislead us.
Besides work, we have relationships, hobbies, financial responsibilities, and our health to maintain. And, as we all know, life isn&#x27;t always a constant joyride. Relationships can strain, health can deteriorate, and unexpected financial problems can arise.
Life is often challenging. We feel down and want to feel better.
We seek solutions and try to identify what needs to change. We yearn for a quick fix, and it&#x27;s easy to blame work. Considering it occupies around a third of our daily lives, it&#x27;s not surprising that we hold our jobs accountable.
&quot;Yes, of course, it&#x27;s my workplace. There we have it. I gotta quit!&quot;
But is that really the root of the problem?
It might be partially, or not at all. Regardless, it&#x27;s never wise to make major decisions based on fleeting, fluctuating, and undefined emotions.
There&#x27;s usually no rush. It&#x27;s worth waiting a while. The most important thing is that it&#x27;s the right decision, whenever and whatever we decide.
You can&#x27;t eliminate ripples on water with a slap. Wait, and they will eventually subside. Against this still background, the correct answer will emerge.</span>

                              <span>There’s a really nice quote that goes along the lines of “we’re a combination of everything we’ve ever known.” We’re just composed of things that we come across in our lives, and I find that very beautiful.
You are a museum.
~evie\
In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the &quot;artifacts&quot; of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy. The things we (uniquely) enjoy are informed by factors as varied and disparate as our blood-sugar levels, among other things. We carefully display our &quot;exhibit of love&quot; in beautiful frames and tags. &quot;This is so me.&quot;
Or, to put it differently - imagine an unimaginably vast wall that contains every interest, hobby, passion, and person to ever exist. The concepts of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;taste&quot; le…</span>

                              <span>Wow those answers are indeed funny. I agree that as an OSS dev/maintainer, it&#x27;s easy to fall on the vice of over-generalization and crusade for the perfect solution, and it feels that&#x27;s exactly what happened there.
&gt; this feature is algorithmically impossible
&gt; You&#x27;re just looking at one specific video, not the general problem.
&gt; is not generally possible.
As a fellow multimedia dev, man, who cares? Sometimes we forget that software ought to be useful, not hypothetical ideals of truth. Just implement the feature for those codecs that support it and which probably are in the 98% percentile of what users actually use, regardless of the damned &quot;general case&quot;.
Or accept and announce shamelessly that you don&#x27;t have either the knowledge or the development resources to tackle such a complex feature. But excuses about not being possible for absolutely every possible codec in a completely generic way is just denying that the world is just a chaotic and dirty place where things are not ideal nor perfect. Just give your users a real-world solution (or rejection).</span>

This really rings true. Just think of all the nonsense you have to deal with in the name of &quot;security.&quot; Mandatory password change intervals. Insane rules for constructing passwords. Completely undocumented password requirements that you just have to figure out by trial and error. Complicated error messages full of security jargon. &quot;Secret Questions&quot; that you can&#x27;t remember the answers to. And on the other side of the coin, the security of these systems themselves is like a sieve. So many data breaches, information disclosures, they are in the news almost daily. I often wonder how they get away with it all.</span>

It covers the judge at the center of the current issue: &quot;Mr. Moraes has jailed five people without a trial for posts on social media that he said attacked Brazil’s institutions. He has also ordered social networks to remove thousands of posts and videos with little room for appeal. And this year, 10 of the court’s 11 justices sentenced a congressman to nearly nine years in prison for making what they said were threats against them in a livestream.&quot;

                              <span>Stripe, Block, and PayPal each solved a massive pain point.
PayPal provided a way to pay people and vendors without giving away your credit card number.
Square made it easy to accept payment in person on a phone, without an extensive upfront underwriting experience and without expensive fixed monthly fees.
Stripe did the same as Square, but for accepting online payments.
Fraud and Risk come in many forms, and these providers, even with their UX innovations, sit on top of those same rails to reduce fraud.  Without those rails, buyers can’t trust sellers and sellers can’t trust buyers.
In my opinion, you need to find a way to solve that problem before you can eliminate the fees being captured by these providers.</span>

Took our friend CS down the coast while she was here this past weekend. Every year she visits from the east coast, we take her to a different part of the Bay (Area). Her first year, we explored the city (San Francisco), the second year we went to Point Reyes, and this year we went a little past Half Moon Bay. Pictures slowly incoming in the photo blog.

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…</span>

What about a no-state solution? Self determination for everyone, no borders, police, or soldiers. A right-of-return for both Jews and Palestinians. —Pirate Prentice (2002)

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12. His trade was house painting and wallpaper hanging, but as we shall see, he was an able polemicist and poet; his words were a shot of adrenaline to ra…</span>

 Until today, we knew that the mechanisms of repression of the state and capital were the army, the police, the schools, the psychiatric hospitals. Now we know that along with them have been added the Greek Cypriot ‘rapprochement’ state intellectuals and social-patriots. How else could we explain the fact that these gentlemen invite representatives from all the supposedly re-reunificationist areas to such a meeting — for represe…</span>

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…</span>

Title: On the expulsion of fascists in Faneromeni

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…</span>

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target. 
 Socialist anarchists, on the other hand, are willing to engage in legitimate work, seeing it …</span>

 “Is it possible to exercise rulership righteously: without killing and without instigating others to kill, without confiscating and without instigating others to confiscate, without sorrowing and without causing sorrow?” 
 -The Buddha, SN 4.20 [1]
Introduction
 Buddhist Anarchism is a synthesis of Anarchism from Buddhist Religion. Buddhism is a religion over 2,500 years old that teaches people to free themselves from Dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness) through practicing Sila, Samadhi and Panya (Virtue, Concentration and Wisdom) and achieving nibbana (enlightenment, freedom from dukkha).

 No contradiction can exist between the economic and the political aspects of a revolutionary conception, even supposing the clearest organic and functional demarcation between them. The same is true for any reactionary conception. Hence the present interpenetration, the agreement and collaboration between unions—economic organs —and political parties—ideological organs—gives us the key to understanding both, from whichever side o…</span>

MatchLabelKeys - Enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates
During a workload&#x27;s (e.g., Deployment) rolling update, a cluster may have Pods from multiple versions at the same time.
However, the scheduler cannot distinguish between old and new versions based on the LabelSelector specified in PodAffinity or PodAntiAffinity. As a result, it will co-locate or disperse Pods regardless of their versions.
This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcome, for example:
New version Pods are co-located with old version Pods (PodAffinity), which will ev…</span>

associated with Reclaim Policy.
The reclaim policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PVC Bound to a PV.
When the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to be honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.31 release, a beta feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.
How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?

One of these requirements is to support Open Container Initiative (OCI)

them to store and distribute any content using OCI registries. A feature like

The country&#x27;s average GDP growth over the past decade, according to government statistics, was around 6.6%. As late as April this year, the World Bank reckoned that Bangladesh would grow by 5.6% this year, led by its highly successful garment industry, which relies on cheap labour sweat shops to gain market share globally.

This post isn&#x27;t a vent, but a candid depiction of the reality of living with depression. (And sometimes I have this strange notion, that perhaps I am helping someone out there also battling depression.)
Recently, I have been forcing myself to leave the house. Depression tries to trick me, to convince me: What will change if you go out? This happens every time I am stuck in the depression loop (as I like to call it). Out of bitterness, I would challenge myself to step out the house for two minutes, then I am free to hide back inside. But the moment I step out, I immediately feel better, and…</span>

The Millennial generation is huge on nostalgia. Here are some of the highlights I remember from growing up in the 1990s.
Fashion
Butterfly hair clips.
Gel bracelets, the more the better... mostly in black and red.
Tattoo chokers -- although I think these are making a comeback amongst the Gen Zs?
White eyeliner -- I&#x27;m not sure why I ever thought this looked good on me, but I tried.
Studded belts worn sideways.
Those milky gel pens that we&#x27;d use to draw/write on ourselves. I remember writing I &lt;3 and the initials of that week&#x27;s crush.
Music
