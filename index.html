                              <span>There has been a deplorable consistency in the remarks and efforts of Robert M. Gates over the past four decades.  In the 1980s, Gates was a major player in the falsification of intelligence regarding the Soviet Union, designed to justify unneeded increases in the defense budget.  In 1986, Gates had to withdraw his name from congressional confirmation for the post of director of the Central Intelligence Agency because the majority of the Senate intelligence committee believed he was lying about his role in the infamous Iran-Contra operation.

                              <span>A crowd of 3,000 anti-tourism protesters descended on posh downtown Barcelona last July, their demeanor one of delighted malice.  They cordoned off hotels and eateries with hazard tape, as if demarcating a crime scene. They sprayed with water guns the blithe holidaymakers seated in restaurants.  Video footage showed unhappy couples and glowering young men chased from their seats by the mob, stunned at the indignity.
The protesters shouted “tourists go home.” They held signs that said “Barcelona is not for sale.” They spoke of “mass touristification” and inveighed against the greed of restaurateurs and hoteliers and Airbnb landlords profiting from the madding crowd while the average Catalan struggled to meet the skyrocketing costs of daily life. One of the protesters told an interviewer, “The city has turned completely for tourists. What we want is a city for citizens.” More

                              <span>In a world of endless notifications, feature-bloated apps, and constant digital noise, I found myself yearning for simplicity. That&#x27;s why I created Nihil - a suite of minimalist tools designed to help you focus on what truly matters.
The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That&#x27;s the core of Nihil&#x27;s philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

What Makes Nihil Different?
Purposeful Design
Every feature in Nihil is there because …</span>

                              <span>In 1967, in the course of the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, the Israeli military razed three Palestinian villages which stood along a corridor connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In keeping with longstanding practice, the Israeli government turned the land over to the Jewish National Fund, which sought to permanently displace the Palestinian villagers through “afforestation,” or redevelopment of the area as a public park, where the former residents would be considered squatters if they tried to return to their homes. To fund the displacement-as-conservation, JNF solicited the Jewish community in Canada, whose contributions also lent the park its name: Canada Park.
Now, more than half a century later, as the Israeli occupation of the West Bank persists amid its ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, JNF’s activities have come under new scrutiny. Most significantly, the Jewish National Fund of Canada has lost its charitable status due to even more outright support for Israeli violence: financing projects for the Israeli military in violation of regulations prohibiting charities from supporting foreign armed forces and activities contrary to public policy, such as illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

                              <span>America and its origin story are full of unexamined assumptions, one of the biggest being that voters actually cast their ballots for presidential candidates. Is democracy – which comes from the Greek words for people (demos) and rule (kratos) – the USA’s foundational “Big Lie”? Consider that, according to Ari Berman’s new book Minority Rule, only 1.8% of the population of the 13 original states voted in George Washington’s 1789 presidential election. In One Person, One Vote? director Maximina Juson goes behind the closed doors of 1787’s Constitutional Convention, when America’s anti-democratic original sin was enshrined in the new nation’s framed rules, and – like Howard Zinn’s People’s History and Oliver Stone’s Untold History of the United States – reveals hidden truths about “the land of the free.”

                              <span>I recognize the author Jascha as an incredibly brilliant ML researcher, formerly at Google  Brain and now at Anthropic.
Among his notable accomplishments, he and coauthors mathematically characterized the propagation of signals through deep neural networks via techniques from physics and statistics (mean field and free probability theory). Leading to arguably some of the most profound yet under-appreciated theoretical and experimental results in ML in the past decade. For example see “dynamical isometry” [1] and the evolution of those ideas which were instrumental in achieving convergence in very deep transformer models [2].
After reading this post and the examples given, in my eyes there is no question that this guy has an extraordinary intuition for optimization, spanning beyond the boundaries of ML and across the fabric of modern society.
We ought to recognize his technical background and raise this discussion above quibbles about semantics and definitions.
Let’s address the heart of his message, the very human and empathetic call to action that stands in the shadow of rapid technological progress:
&gt; If you are a scientist looking for research ideas which are pro-social, and have the potential to create a whole new field, you should consider building formal (mathematical) bridges between results on overfitting in machine learning, and problems in economics, political science, management science, operations research, and elsewhere.

                              <span>Well hmm. NASA decided Starliner wasn&#x27;t safe enough to use for the return journey, so the astronauts stayed on the ISS until the next ride became available.
Originally the astronauts were supposed to go back on Starliner. Now they&#x27;re taking another ride back. Is that considered a rescue? Well, it depends.
If you get left behind on an island because your ride wasn&#x27;t safe and another boat picks you up, is that a rescue? Now what if you&#x27;re 420 kilometers up and another boat has to come get you. Is that a rescue?
If there wasn&#x27;t another ride from the ISS available, would the astronauts be stranded? Yes.
In that case, if a ride suddenly became available would it be considered a rescue? Probably, yes.</span>

Essence of Data Oriented Design (DOD)
In software design, DOD (Data-Oriented Design) focuses on efficient data structures to optimize performance, especially in critical scenarios like game development, real-time systems, and high-performance computing. A key principle is to minimize cache misses by organizing data for maximum locality, keeping related data close in memory.
I will be showing you what is being discussed in Andrew Kelley&#x27;s video.
TLDR:

&#x3D;&#x3D;Using Array Indices only took 16 bytes vs 48 bytes in Array Pointers.&#x3D;&#x3D;
Use Index in ArrayList instead of Pointers
Memory Usage
As shown in the image, Array Pointers uses 48 bytes while Array Indices only uses 16 bytes. This is because the Array2D_Pointers struct requires additional memory to store the pointers …</span>

I&#x27;ve decided I like the SBC V8. Well, actually I know very little about internal combustion engines but after watching enough YouTube videos about them and enough time wrestling them out of engine bays I guess I&#x27;ve developed a fondness. A standard engine block platform with a single cam and 8 great big holes that are drilled out at different diameters to give different displacement and different engines altogether.
Speaking of the SBC, the 307 is coming along nicely, specifically the paint!

That&#x27;s right, I am now part of the side of the internet that believes that SBC V8s should all be orange unlike the filthy peasants of the SBC world who choose to paint them red.

While not the screamiest of V8 engines, I feel quite happy with a modest and dignified 5.0L engine for this build, af…</span>

There&#x27;s a scene where the male lead, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), was putting googly eyes all over the lanterns and doing a sneaky shush at the camera before running away.
&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s [deadname],&quot; said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.
Eh? That&#x27;s me?
I&#x27;ll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my &quot;I have to be a man&quot; phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It&#x27;s very easy to read it that way because Waymond&#x27;s character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead. He is presented as effeminate, weak, and his voice is high-pitched and lacks a full range. As a knee-jerk gut reaction, we foc…</span>

Do you sometimes hear that? I think it&#x27;s such an incredibly stupid thing to say. If you were me, which you clearly aren&#x27;t, then you would do something that I, as myself, wouldn’t do.
It&#x27;s just a way of expressing oneself, someone might think. I beg to differ.
My feeling is that the person who expresses themselves in that way has a lot of their own issues that should be addressed. Instead of doing that, they get a momentary, false sense of &quot;I got my shit together&quot; by explaining what others should do.
Do you want to share your own experiences? Please do, I love listening to that. Do you have specific advice to give? Bring it on, and I&#x27;ll take what applies to who I am here and now.
Do you want to explain what&#x27;s best for me right now? Keep it to yourself, please, and sort out your own shit first. Good luck!

This is a project I&#x27;ve started many times before without a lot of success on several different WordPress sites—all of which no longer exist. The first was a free blog I set up when I first came to Japan in 2015 as a student. I&#x27;d seen so many blogs by other exchange students and thought it&#x27;d be pretty exciting. The only problem was that I didn&#x27;t think that anything I was doing was very exciting, so I quickly stopped doing it. I&#x27;ve tried since to make several paid sites that focus on my reading and writing book reviews. There were a lot of problems with that, most of which came down to the fact that I was extremely worried about making the &quot;perfect&quot; site even though it was just something that I wanted to do for fun.

This long-form essay was sent to us for publication by “some communist study group“. It discusses the historical role of Ukraine in the contemporary political economy, the response from radicals in the West towards the Russian invasion, and the material effects on the global political economy emanating from the disruption of a major bread basket, specifically with an eye towards revolt. The questions raised here are important not just for the current moment, but also for any social movement that desires to truly engage with “present state of t…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Data structures play a crucial role in determining the performance and efficiency of algorithms. The Array of Structs (AoS) and Struct of Arrays (SoA) are two popular data structures used to represent complex data. Although they can store similar data, they differ in memory layout, access patterns, and performance.
Here&#x27;s an excellent video on Data Oriented Design by Andrew Kelley the creator of Zig programming language.
Array of Structs (AoS)
An AoS is a data structure composed of an array of structures, where each structure represents a single entity with multiple fields or members. The structures are stored contiguously in memory, one after the other.
typedef struct {
    int id;
    float x;
    float y;
} PointAOS;

PointAOS is a struct containing three fields: id (an int…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s from my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic when they can actually see you hurting. For the millionth time in my life, I wished depression manifested like the flu or some other recognizable disease, just to make it simple for me and for the people around me.
How much easier would it be if mental illness were physical - visible and tangible? A runny nose and a sore throat - people would understand. They would offer me tissues, a warm cup of tea, and a sympathetic get well soon. But a shitty compilation of mental symptoms and an even shittier chemical make up? How do I explain an intangible pain?
What can I say, anyway? Sometimes I feel like I am carrying around a heavy suitcase full of sadness everywhere that I go. The smallest task feels impossible. Everything is dull yet heavy, all at once.  Everything matters too much yet nothing matters. Anything would be easier to explain than what&#x27;s really going on.
I think this topic further resonates with me as someone with high-functioning depression. I recall an attempt to open up about my state with a close friend, who reacted with amusement and disbelief, as if I was exchanging lighthearted banter. But you are so put together, Tala. You are successful, ace tests, and excel at work - it must be a misdiagnosis.
I was overwhelmed with shame that later transformed into rage. I found it impossible to articulate the depth of pain - that yes, I am waking up everyday, leaving bed, fulfilling my obligations. But I am still struggling, still fighting a relentless battle with the energy I have left.
And there are millions of us suffering a silent, invisible battle against our mental illnesses, while we present a facade of normalcy to world. Because sometimes silence is the easier option.</span>

Of course there are services I subscribe to - I currently pay for Proton, Spotify and Apple Fitness.
One reason is, of course, that these services don’t offer lifetime payment. But in their cases, I understand how that’s not feasible - their services are heavily dependent on serving content via cloud and development of new content and improved features. The bandwidth needs to be paid for, artists, devs and fitness trainers need to be paid constantly.
But I try to limit what I subscribe to. Everyone has a maximum amount of subscriptions they’re willing to have at the same time and p…</span>

As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I understand that Charlie Munger&#x27;s observation &quot;“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” is applicable everywhere - including science.
Academic scientists&#x27; careers are driven by publishing, citations and impact.  Arguably some have figured how to game the system to advance their careers.  Science be damned.</span>

                              <span>These sorts of articles raise so many thoughts and emotions in me.  I was trained as a computational biologist with a little lab work and ran gels from time to time.  Personally, I hated gels- they&#x27;re finicky, messy, ugly, and don&#x27;t really tell you very much.  But molecular biology as a field runs on gels- it&#x27;s the priimary source of results for almost everything in molbio.  I have seen more talks and papers that rested entirely a single image of a gel which is really just some dark bands.
At the same time, I was a failed scientist: my gels weren&#x27;t as interesting, or convincing compared to the ones done by the folks who went on to be more successful.  At the time (20+ years ago) it didn&#x27;t occur to me that anybody would intentionally modify images of gels to promote the results they claimed, although I did assume that folks didn&#x27;t do a good job of organizing their data, and occasionally published papers that were wrong simply because they confused two images.
Would I have been more successful if fewer people (and I now believe this is a common occurrence) published fraudulent images of gels?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the more important thing is that everybody just went along with this.  I participated in many journal clubs where folks would just flip to Figure 3, assume the gel was what the authors claimed, and proceed to agree with (or disagree with) the results and conclusions uncritically.  Whereas I would spend a lot of time trying to understand what experiment was actually run, and what th e data showed.</span>

                              <span>I am always glad to see people pursuing creating their own programming language. More people should give it a try, IMHO.
A tricky thing that comes up with Rust comparisons is that often, Rust has a feature that&#x27;s weird or hard to use, but it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s the only solution that makes sense within the constraints Rust has placed upon itself. Clicking some links gets me to https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/src/branch/master/docs/yao/de...
&gt; Yao&#x27;s biggest goals are: Correctness, Convenience, Performance, in that order.
Having clear goals is a great thing when making a language, because they give you guidance on what is appropriate to include and what is not.
Rust has certainly demonstrated having similar goals, but in a slightly different order: Correctness, Performance, and then Convenience. So it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if Yao could do some things better than Rust, in accordance with its goals. But that also means that sometimes, Rust would be useful where Yao cannot be. Everything is tradeoffs.
Incidentally, I actually think that figuring out what your values are, and what your needs are, is a great way to pick a programming language. Decide what matters to you as an engineer, and then find a language that shares similar values. I gave a conference talk a few years back on this idea, and how I viewed Rust&#x27;s values at the time https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-tradeoffs/
This was based off of bcantrill&#x27;s Platform as a Reflection of Values, which was very influential on me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Xhx970_JKX4
If you&#x27;ve ever heard about Oxide&#x27;s focus on values, this is some of the older background on that.</span>

                              <span>We took our kids to Disney World once.
When asked what their favorite part of the trip was, they responded..
The hot tub.
At the hotel.
My kids light up the most when I am fully engaged with them, fully present, entertaining their ideas, and asking questions.
Their favorite family trip so far?  When we traveled to Arkansas to mine for crystals.  AKA, dig in the dirt all day.  They saw it on a YouTube video. They asked to go.  So we obliged. I had never been to Arkansas.  It&#x27;s beautiful.
We stayed at a resort, Diamonds Old West Cabins, with a huge playground outside the cabins, archery, and a bubble party every evening at 6 pm.
They still talk about that trip.</span>

Western industrial culture was based on substance - getting real shit done. There  was always a lot of scammery around it, but the bedrock goal was to make physical things happen - build things, invent things, deliver things, innovate.
PR and ad culture was there to support that. The goal was to change values and behaviours to get people to Buy More Stuff. OK.
Then around the time the Internet arrived, industry was off-shored, and the culture started to become one of appearance and performance, not of substance and action.

Food, gambling, etc. are all backed by hordes of brilliant well paid people trying to get you to ruin your life so they make money. On the other side is just regular people like us stressed out trying to survive.
This isn&#x27;t some &quot;freedom&quot; issue, it&#x27;s an incredibly huge power asymmetry and I think &quot;we the people&quot; need protection from these forces</span>

                              <span>The most depressing thing for me is the feeling that I simply cannot trust anything that has been written in the past 2 years or so and up until the day that I die. It&#x27;s not so much that I think people have used AI, but that I know they have with a high degree of certainty, and this certainty is converging to 100%, simply because there is no way it will not. If you write regularly and you&#x27;re not using AI, you simply cannot keep up with the competition. You&#x27;re out. And the growing consensus is &quot;why shouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;, there is no escape from that.
Now, I&#x27;m not going to criticize anyone that does it, like I said, you have to, that&#x27;s it. But what I had never noticed until now is that knowing that a human being was behind the written words (however flawed they can be, and hopefully are) is crucial for me. This has completely destroyed my interest in reading any new things. I guess I&#x27;m lucky that we have produced so much writing in the past century or so and I&#x27;ll never run out of stuff to read, but it&#x27;s still depressing, to be honest.</span>

The thing I’m tired of is elites stealing everything under the sun to feed these models. So funny that copyright is important when it protects elites but not when a billion thefts are committed by LLM folks. Poor incentives for creators to create stuff if it just gets stolen and replicated by AI.
I’m hungry for more lawsuits. The biggest theft in human history by these gang of thieves should be held to account. I want a waterfall of lawsuits to take back what’s been stolen. It’s in the public’s interest to see this happen.</span>

                              <span>Sports gambling has been legal in the UK since 1960. Gambling wasn&#x27;t seriously problematic in this country until 2005, when regulations were substantially liberalised. Pre-2005, sports betting was something that old men did in dingy backstreet shops; post-2005, it became a widespread social phenomenon, turbocharged by advertising and the growing influence and accessibility of the internet.
There&#x27;s a false dichotomy between prohibition and laissez-faire, which the US seems particularly prone to. You&#x27;ve seen similar issues with the decriminalisation of cannabis, where many states seem to have switched abruptly from criminalisation to a fully-fledged commercial market. There is a broad spectrum of other options in between those points that tend to be under-discussed.
You can ban gambling advertising, as Italy did in 2019. You can set limits on maximum stakes or impose regulations to make gambling products less attractive to new customers and less risky for problem gamblers. You can have a single state-controlled parimutuel operator. Gambling does cause harm - whether it&#x27;s legal or not - but it is within the purview of legislators to create a gambling market in which harm reduction is the main priority.</span>

                              <span>Sports gambling, like all gambling, ruins lives. It&#x27;s certainly worth having the discussion about whether people should be able to run a train through their life and the lives of their families via app.
But a much easier argument against sports betting is that it ruins the sports. Players throw. They get good at subtly cheating. The gambling apparatus latches itself to the sport, to the teams and players, the umpires and judges, the sporting organizations. With this much money on the line, it&#x27;s not a matter of if but when games are thrown, cheated -- the bigger the game, the bigger the incentive. It&#x27;s even easier now because of the amount of side/parlay betting that is available. It exhausts the spirit of competition.
Sports gambling is diametrically opposed to sport itself.</span>

Immigration. A nation of immigrants, with dying main streets, empty classrooms, and labor shortages in key industries, is about to cast its votes based in large part on which candidate can best be trusted to reduce rates of both legal and illegal immigration.

                              <span>The launching of the widespread terror campaign targeting civilians in Lebanon is an integral part of the Israeli war strategy to achieve tactical military objectives. The new Israeli strikes which started on September 17 with the exploding pagers have resulted so far in more than 5000 killed and injured Lebanese.
For the past 11 months, the Lebanese Resistance limited its attacks exclusively to Israeli military bases, in or near, the &quot;Jewish-only&quot; colonies along the Lebanese border. The current Israeli assault was likely planned to take place on September 16 ahead of the aexplosion of the pagers, but had to be postponed due to an unforeseen clash with the visit of Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein. Consequently, Israel may have failed, either due to confusion or technical difficulties, to reprogram the pagers’ activation to another date. More

                              <span>Earlier this month, I decided to try something different on my blog. Some people caught on since some new older posts appeared on their RSS reader from me. I haven’t gotten a chance to explain it and since it’s nearing the end of the month, and a similar post will be popping up shortly, I figured I’d explain what I’m trying to do.
It’s a reverse POSSE of sorts that I’m calling #microthoughts
But first to understand what a reverse of something is, we must understand what it is.
POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content.

In one of those unfortunate coincidences in life, I had the opportunity to relocate to the United States, while scientist was offered a postdoctoral research position in Canada—both at the same time.
After putting all the cards (offers, spreadsheets, etc.) on the table, my wife rejected the offer from the Canadian university, and I accepted the one in the U.S.
In Canada, scientist would have had a salary and health insurance, but I wouldn’t. Additionally, I wouldn’t be able to work as her dependent. In the U.S., however, we would both have everything—health insurance, the abil…</span>

I believe everyone here must know what depression is, right? Well, if you don’t know, you can click here and read more about it… Well, what probably some people don’t know is that there is chronic depression, meaning no matter how much you try to improve, change, take medication, find hobbies, or whatever the attempt may be; you will die with depression. And I’ve had it since I was 16, but I’m not going to tell you my age, right (I’m in my 20s, lol).

                              <span>This won&#x27;t have nearly the same impact, but when you&#x27;re considering how vulnerabilities like this might influence your future purchasing decisions, remember that Kia&#x27;s decision to omit interlocks from their US vehicles (but not Canadian ones!) led to a nationwide epidemic of Kia thefts so large it fed a crime wave, something a number of US cities are suing Kia over. If you&#x27;ve read about carjacking waves in places like Milwaukee and Chicago: that was largely driven by a decision Kia made, which resulted in the nationwide deployment of a giant fleet of &quot;burner&quot; cars that could be stolen with nothing but a bent USB cable.</span>

                              <span>The problem I have with this is simple and has to do with the lack of separation of entities.
Automattic is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.com is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation IS NOT a competitor with WPEngine.
There is a dispute between Automattic and WPEngine. The resources of Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation should not be leverage in this dispute.
The fact that those boundaries are crossed means that anyone who is in competition with Automattic might have any and all ecosystems that Matt has any control over leveraged against them if they upset Matt or Automattic in any way.
It is very poor taste and changes the perspective of the product. Instead of a professional entity who will engage professionally it is now a form of leverage that a single person could wield against anyone who crosses them.
To be clear these same exact actions can be taken against anyone who insults one individual. This look is embarrassing.</span>

Wow, that&#x27;s brave. Create a wrapper around ChatGPT, call it a lawyer, and never check the output. $193k fine seems like peanuts.
Sometimes I think about where I would be in life if I had no moral or ethical qualms. I&#x27;d probably be running a company like this.</span>

Huge kudos to Meta for breaking new ground and doing a ton of R&amp;D/M&amp;A to get to this point. Once MicroLED comes on a little further and the form factor shrinks this could be the next consumer electronics platform.
Silicon carbide is really interesting, we need high RI materials to make this work.

I guess technically it&#x27;s supposed to play some role in making sure OpenAI &quot;benefits humanity&quot;. But as we&#x27;ve seen multiple times, whenever that goal clashes with the interests of investors, the latter wins out.</span>

 Jean-Baptiste Vidalou, “We Are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle” (Cambridge: Polity, 2023) 
 It’s shameful. The original French publication of We are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle by Jean-Baptiste Vidalou was in my hands since April 2018. Frequently described as “the French Seeing Like a State,” the book explores the art of state making in France. Having been in stimulating dialogues with Jean-Baptiste Vidalou (JBV) since 2018, and being linguistically challenged, I knew the general ideas and points in the book—…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how capable the new 1B model is, considering it&#x27;s just a 1.3GB download (for the Ollama GGUF version).
I tried running a full codebase through it (since it can handle 128,000 tokens) and asking it to summarize the code - it did a surprisingly decent job, incomplete but still unbelievable for a model that tiny: https://gist.github.com/simonw/64c5f5b111fe473999144932bef42...
More of my notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/llama-32/
I&#x27;ve been trying out the larger image models to using the versions hosted on https://lmarena.ai/ - navigate to &quot;Direct Chat&quot; and you can select them from the dropdown and upload images to run prompts.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to have missed this part of the story in all the chaos, but from the NYTimes in March:
Ms. Murati wrote a private memo to Mr. Altman raising questions about his management and also shared her concerns with the board. That move helped to propel the board’s decision to force him out.
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/technology/openai-executi...
It should be no surprise if Sam Altman wants executives who opposed his leadership, like Mira and Ilya, out of the company. When you&#x27;re firing a high-level executive in a polite way, it&#x27;s common to let them announce their own departure and frame it the way they want.</span>

                              <span>&gt; &quot;I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.&quot;
This is now to me the &quot;old school&quot; internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don&#x27;t blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly &quot;Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?&quot;
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it&#x27;s been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don&#x27;t participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these &quot;professional&quot; creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.</span>

                              <span>In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>Hey,
How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …</span>

                              <span>five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn&#x27;t really my choice; the doctor said that they could &quot;try to do some creative billing,&quot; but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i&#x27;m away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i&#x27;m living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i&#x27;ve met so many wonderful friends. i&#x27;ve lost a few. i&#x27;ve bought a car. i&#x27;ve gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i&#x27;ve had more than a few mental health episodes... i&#x27;ve also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i&#x27;ve learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what&#x27;ll happen in the next five!</span>

                              <span>Trading activity in benchmark U.S. Treasury securities now concentrates on the last trading day of the month. Moreover, this stepped-up activity is associated with lower transaction costs, as shown by a smaller price impact of trades. We conjecture that increased turn-of-month portfolio rebalancing by passive investment funds that manage relative to fixed-income indices helps explain these patterns.</span>

I’ve not… really… spent a lot of energy thinking of a “my time on Cohost” retrospective post like some folks have done (which have all been a pleasure to read!) because I’m not sure I really can. I think it’s easy to pick apart the stuff that’s individually made Cohost such a wonderful place to exist on, and certainly added to the greater whole of the thing, but trying to sum up everything into A Post feels impossible. How do you sum up years of emotion and attachment in a way that’s, like, understandable to others outside your specific lived experience on a website built to let the individual tailor it to their desires.

Introductions
Arvind: Hello, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you
like to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with
Kubernetes?
Kensei: Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada
(@sanposhiho), a software engineer at
Tetrate.io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more
than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG-Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of
two SIG subprojects,
kube-scheduler-simulator and
kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.
