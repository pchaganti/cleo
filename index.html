first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash

Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn&#x27;t just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the

And in a sense, war, the urge to take someone else’s territory or simply kill endless numbers of… well, us… has certainly been in that very same bloodstream at least since the first great literary work of the Western world, The Iliad, was written.

Six months later, on May 17, 2004, same-sex marriage was legally recognized in Massachusetts. Nearly a decade later, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Obergefell v.

                              <span>My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.</span>

                              <span>Today is one of those days when I feel I have nothing to write.
Then I started thinking...
What is it that says you have to have something to write to start writing? It&#x27;s just an idea, an idea of how things work.
You have something to write.
You write it.
It doesn&#x27;t have to be like that. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.
There are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...
It should be sunny on Midsummer day (it&#x27;s a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).
When life doesn&#x27;t go the way it&#x27;s “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.
What if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things &quot;should be”? What if we face the day with a little &quot;let&#x27;s see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings&quot;?
It&#x27;s worth trying.</span>

It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…</span>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.</span>

                              <span>Many Americans are celebrating the news of Donald Trump’s conviction on 34 felony charges in a hush-money incident that took place ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Newspaper headlines screamed “TRUMP GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS” and media reports relied on superlatives such as “historic” and “unprecedented” to label the unanimous jury verdict. Given that Trump has been unusually adept at avoiding accountability for a staggering number of alleged crimes, the verdict felt like a long-overdue comeuppance. More

Hungary is slashing income tax for women with four or more children. Russia is offering women with 10 or more children a “Mother-Heroine” award. Greece, Italy, and South Korea are bribing women with attractive baby bonuses. China has instituted a three-child policy. Iran has outlawed free contraceptives and vasectomies. Japan has joined forces with the fertility industry to infiltrate schools to promote early childbearing. A leading UK demographer has proposed taxing the childless. Religious myths are preventing African men from getting vasectomies. A eugenics-inspired Natal conference just took place in the U.S., a nation leading the way in taking away reproductive rights.

                              <span>More than a desire to restore a supposed national glory, Trump’s quest to “make America great again” is the search for his own “authentic essence.” His narcissism is pathological. He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him. More

During the extremely wet winter a year earlier, the great Tulare Lake had once again overflowed its dams, dikes, levees and ditches, as it does every once in a while despite all the efforts of government and agribusiness, and spread to its full size of 800 square miles just south of the Rancheria, The return of the lake brought new faith and determination to these extraordinary people, who have lived here since long before the coming of the Europeans whom they have barely managed to survive.

                              <span>In politics, context is crucial. To truly appreciate the recent decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize the state of Palestine, the subject has to be placed in proper context. On November 15, 1988, Yasser Arafat, then Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, declared Palestine as an independent state. The proclamation took place within  More

Lame ducks can mess around and get away with a lot of things they might not otherwise if they were facing re-election.
I like to use that term to describe the habit I have of completely abandoning my usual routine before big life changes like going to college or starting a new job. This week I&#x27;ve replaced my usual routine of exercise and healthy eating with junk food binges and late bedtimes. Instead of reading and writing before bed I play videogames.

                              <span>I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Synopsis
 How can the link between city and child be made more fruitful and enjoyable for both the child and the city? 
 At a time when a significant proportion of the city’s children are at war with their environment, the question raised by this book becomes ever more urgent for teachers and parents, citizens and policy makers. Through an enormously rich range of refere…</span>

Title: International Workers Aid To Bosnia
Subtitle: Syndicalists truck flour directly to Bosnia unions
Date: December 1994
Notes: This article, from a presentation on June 1993 at the European Syndicalist Conference, appeared in Nov.-Dec. 1994 Industrial Worker newspaper

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.</span>

                              <span>I love my blog! I really do! I want to write every day. But I don&#x27;t. Why? Because of the Perfection Bug!
&quot;You need to share a unique thought&quot;
&quot;Your idea should be worth penning&quot;
&quot;You need to write in great detail&quot;
Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.
But today, I decided to squash that bug!
I don&#x27;t need unique thoughts. I don&#x27;t need amazing ideas. I don&#x27;t need to explain things in detail.
All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all I need to write on my blog.
So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to messing with the blog&#x27;s CSS! I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.
I&#x27;ve also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...
While I&#x27;m deciding, please enjoy the croissant button. It&#x27;s given me more serotonin than it should.</span>

                              <span>If anyone is perplexed or surprised why Americans are so upset about the economy, they should look no further than the Income Distribution and Dynamics in America (IDDA) recent report by the Federal Reserve Board of Minneapolis and its data site that looks at the stagnation of American income and economic mobility in America. It unfortunately confirms what we already know—the neoliberal state benefits unevenly and in ways that confound an ability to challenge it..
