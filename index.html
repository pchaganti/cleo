                              <span>A $1.3 billion revenue company being too tight to pay this after all, even on their 2nd chance, is so short-sighted it&#x27;s absurd. They&#x27;re putting out a huge sign saying &quot;When you find a vuln, definitely contact all our clients because we won&#x27;t be giving you a penny!&quot;.
Incredible. This must be some kind of &quot;damaged ego&quot; or ass-covering, as it&#x27;s clearly not a rational decision.

                              <span>I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.
For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.
I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.
There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.
This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.</span>

                              <span>i haven&#x27;t been able to make much art lately. which is pretty frustrating, because i genuinely want to work on art. but i have been nonstop stressed for the past month. and unfortunately, being stressed out makes my health problems flare up, which means that my ability to concentrate goes completely out the window.
every now and then, i&#x27;ll pull out my sketchbook to doodle something, or sketching stuff in MS Paint, or whatever. i&#x27;m trying to keep my creative skills engaged, even if it&#x27;s in small amounts. but man... it&#x27;s rough. i keep fantasizing about drawing beautiful illustrations, and not having the physical strength to do anything about it.
i&#x27;m accustomed to this cycle, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less miserable, you know? i can&#x27;t even begin to count how many times i&#x27;ve been through this. my best coping method for this dreaded cycle is to avoid beating myself up over it, try to be patient and forgiving with myself, and chip away at projects when i&#x27;m able to.
it feels kind of embarrassing to keep reposting art from my archives, though. i&#x27;ve been posting art to mastodon/bluesky, since i&#x27;m trying to rebuild my online presence in a post-cohost world. and... i desperately wish i had newer pieces to show. it&#x27;ll happen when it happens - i shouldn&#x27;t risk pushing my body further when i&#x27;m already in a lot of pain - but i still feel sad about it.
just gotta take a deep breath, and be patient. in the meantime, i&#x27;d like to take the downtime to study art styles i find compelling. i&#x27;ve gravitated towards 90s anime fantasy art for years, despite my shockingly-minimal exposure to anime, so it&#x27;d be fun to study some artbooks. and maybe i&#x27;ll take the time to work on more weird little web projects - we&#x27;ll see.</span>

                              <span>I know there&#x27;s a big &quot;well if you could do it better, why don&#x27;t you just do it then???&quot;-type defense towards people who criticize Cohost, as if they&#x27;re trying to critique the work of a football player or an artist. But I don&#x27;t think those are fair comparisons because many, many white-collar, nine-to-five workers have to navigate the same issues the Cohost staff did, which validates some of these arguments (not all, I&#x27;ll admit).
This isn&#x27;t a blog post about Cohost paying themselves salaries, but more about the actual work prioritization and team management skills. I&#x27;m not really interested in talking about their salaries because I understand they have to eat obviously, and if they weren&#x27;t willing to work on Cohost as a side-project while having full-time jobs, then there was really no optio…</span>

                              <span>I used to take a lot of long exposure photography. I was obsessed with getting as much of the light burst effects as possible in my photos. These days, I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I did any semblance of long exposure or night photography.
Here&#x27;s a photo from Fed Hill, overlooking the Baltimore Harbor. One of my favorite spots to watch the city lights.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on tirzepatide (Mounjaro) for 4 months now. I&#x27;m down 13% of my body weight. I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I&#x27;ve kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I&#x27;ve started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.
All this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it&#x27;s time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I&#x27;m forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.
I say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I&#x27;ve had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle. I don&#x27;t know what is so different about having the drug help me, but I can tell you that it has been different.</span>

                              <span>Agreed on hoping this is the inflection point, but only partial agreement that it&#x27;s about adblock.  For sure Google wants adblock to die, but I think it goes even deeper than that.
I think it&#x27;s part of a much bigger trend in tech in general but also in Google:  Removing user control.  When you look at the &quot;security&quot; things they are doing, many of them have a common philosophy underpinning them that the user (aka device owner) is a security threat and must be protected against.  Web integrity, Manifest v3, various DoH/DoT, bootloader locking, device integrity which conveniently makes root difficult/impossible, and more.
To all the engineers working on this stuff, I hope you&#x27;re happy that your work is essentially destroying the world that you and I grew up in.  The next generation won&#x27;t have the wonderful and fertile computing environment that we enjoyed, and it&#x27;s (partly) your fault.</span>

&gt; Firefox, however, has no plans to deprecate MV2 and will continue to support MV2 extensions for the foreseeable future. And even if we re-evaluate this decision at some point down the road, we anticipate providing a notice of at least 12 months for developers to adjust accordingly and not feel rushed.[1]

                              <span>Classic bait and switch setup. Selling people the future in 2 years time with little to nothing to show for today. Timelines will slip, plans will change, software won‘t be ready, prices will change. And that doesn’t even account for where Waymo is in two years from now, or what the Chinese EV industry is able to pull off until then.
Even this underwhelming event was originally announced on short notice to prop up perception when sales looked bad in April [1], delayed by two‘ish months, and then didn‘t even start on time. Oh, and implementing the robo taxi was a two-months project back then [1]. It‘s a ruse, folks.

                              <span>It would be good to be able to recognize fascism when you see it. Sight is our dominant sense (light travels faster than sound) and provides us warning. In addition, because “fascist” is an epithet as well as political term, it must be used carefully. In 1942, a New Hampshire Jehovah’s Witness named Chaplinsky was arrested after calling a Rochester city marshal a “damned fascist.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the arrest on the grounds that the expression constituted “fighting words,” excluded from constitutional protection. Recent court decisions in the U.S. have widened speech freedoms, but the word “fascist” remains highly charged, underlining the need for historical and political discretion. More

                              <span>I am running Mythic Bastionland with my home table. Here is what they knew when the campaign began.

The Land
The Vale’s sorrow knows no succor. Wanderers in the wilderness glimpse remnants of the Sun Guard’s emblem carved on ancient stones, the Queen’s face engraved on old metal coins. Little is remembered of what caused the Realm to fail. Harpists sing of a dying Queen seeking the cup of Solace. Others gossip of jealous lovers or sibling strife. What is known is in the last Age, the Sun Guard sallied forth from their Rotunda in the Queen’s Halls in Baelfyre, their eyes yearning for the City’s gleam. They were never seen again
They are lost and dispersed, withering in forgotten groves or rotting in hollows. There are rumors that their ancient hall still stands.
In these latter days of the fallen queen’s realm, peace extends no farther than a hold’s torchlight. The Forest and Wilderness cast long shadows. The Vale is a remote realm carved out with warrior’s blood on the edge of the empire across the Sea. There is word that lawlessness reigns, with roving warbands terrorizing the countryside and strange mystics shouting apocalyptic prophecies. Nature reclaims the queen’s road. craven opportunists find easy avenues to power

For the Players
You are hedge knights, come to this Land seeking opportunity, your knighthoods fresh as morning dew. You are the children of spring. Your new arms shine in the midday sun. You came to your knighthoods over the long cold winter, called to serve by the Seers and sworn to your oaths.
Despite whatever burgeoning relationships (good or ill) you may have, you are a Company, newly formed of foreigners sent to a land unseen by your fathers.</span>

A combination of untreated bipolar disorder and active alcoholism gave me a perpetual frown and a repertoire of caustic comments.

I have to admit that in a lot of ways, I have it made. I work because I want to, not because I have to. My wife and kids love me. The rest of my family is self-sufficient and drama-free.

                              <span>After trying various solutions - including DeskPad - I came up with a custom cross-platform (I&#x27;m on macOS, but assume it&#x27;ll work elsewhere) solution that worked incredibly well on my 40&quot; ultrawide monitor: OBS[1].
Having never used OBS before but knowing it was popular among streamers, I wondered if I could use it to (1) only share the specific applications I wanted to share and (2) share them at a resolution that people could actually read, without constantly being asked to zoom in.
I first tried setting up a virtual camera and sharing via my video stream, but it was laggy and the quality was so poor that people couldn&#x27;t read what I was sharing. I quickly gave up on that approach.
Then I discovered Projectors[2]. By right-clicking on the main view in OBS and selecting &quot;Windowed Projector (Preview)&quot;, it launches a separate window, which I can then share directly via Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.
Whatever I drag into the OBS view is displayed in the Windowed Projector (similar to DeskPad), with the added bonus that I can choose to blur certain applications that might be dragged in. For example, if I open Slack or my password manager, the entire window blurs until I focus back on my terminal or browser.
It took a bunch of tweaking to perfect, but I&#x27;m very pleased with how well it works now.

                              <span>Javascript is not simple AT ALL.
It has 3 ways to declare functions, multiple variations on arrow functions syntax, a weird prototyping inheritance system, objects you can create out of &quot;new&quot; on functions, object literals that can act an pseudo-classes, classes, decorators, for-i loop + maps + filter + for-in loop (with hasOwn) + forEach, async / await + promises and an invisible but always-on event loop, objects proxies, counter-intuitive array and mapping manipulations, lots of different ways to create said arrays and mappings, very rich destructuring, so many weirdnesses on parameter handling, multiple ways to do imports that don&#x27;t work in all contexts, exports, string concatenation + string interpolation, no integer (but NaN), a &quot;strict mode&quot;, two versions of comparison operators, a dangerous &quot;with&quot; keyword, undefined vs null, generators, sparse arrays, sets...
It also has complex rules for:
- scoping (plus global variables by default and hoisting)
- &quot;this&quot; values (and manual binding)
- type coercion (destroying commutativity!)
- semi-column automatic insertion
- &quot;typeof&quot; resolution
On top of that, you execute it in various different implementations and contexts: several browser engines and nodejs at least, with or without the DOM, in or out web workers, and potentially with WASM.
There are various versions of the ECMA standard that changes the features you have access to, unless you use a transpiler. But we don&#x27;t even touch the ecosystem since it&#x27;s about the language. There would be too much to say anyway.
There are only two reasons to believe JS is simple: you know too much about it, or you don&#x27;t know enough.</span>

                              <span>I am not sure how to really refine this thought I have had, but I have this fear that every language eventually gets so bloated and complicated that it has a huge barrier to entry.
The ones that stand out the most to me are C# and Typescript.
Microsoft has a large team dedicated towards improving these languages constantly and instead of exclusively focusing on making them easier to use or more performant, they are constantly adding features. After all, it is their job. They are incentivized to keep making it more complex.
The first time I ever used C# was probably version 5? Maybe? We&#x27;re on version 12 now and there&#x27;s so much stuff in there that sometimes modern C# code from experts looks unreadable to me.
One of the reasons I have so much fun working in node/Javascript these days is because it is simple and not much has changed in express/node/etc for a long time. If I need an iterable that I can simply move through, I just do &#x60;let items &#x3D; [];&#x60;. It is so easy and hasn&#x27;t changed for so many years. I worry that we eventually come out with a dozen ways to do an array and modern code becomes much more challenging to read.
When Typescript first came out, it was great. Types in Javascript are something we&#x27;ve always wanted. Now, Typescript is on version 5.6 and there is so much stuff you can do with it that it&#x27;s overwhelming. And nobody uses most of it!
This is probably just old man ranting, but I think there&#x27;s something there. The old version I used to debate about was C vs C++. Now look at modern C++, it&#x27;s crazy powerful but so jam packed that many people have just gone back to C.</span>

                              <span>As the person ultimately responsible for the Minecraft Wiki ending up in the hands of Fandom, it is great to see what Weird Gloop (and similar) are achieving. At the time of selling out, the Minecraft Wiki and Minecraft Forum cost tens of thousands of dollars per month to run and so it didn&#x27;t feel too much like selling out, because we needed money to survive[1]. 15 years later, the internet is a different place, and with the availability of Cloudflare, running high-traffic websites is much more cost effective.
If I could do things over again, on today&#x27;s internet, I like to believe Weird Gloop is the type of organisation we would have built rather than ending up inside Fandom&#x27;s machine. I guess that&#x27;s all to say: thank you Weird Gloop for achieving what we couldn&#x27;t (and sorry to all who have suffered Fandom when reading about Minecraft over the years).
[1] That&#x27;s a bit of a cop out, we did have options, the decision to sell was mostly driven by me being a dumb kid. In hindsight, we could have achieved independent sustainability, it was just far beyond what my tiny little mind could imagine.</span>

                              <span>As someone who spent most of a career in process automation, I&#x27;ve decided doing it well is mostly about state limitation.
Exceptions or edge cases add additional states.
To fight the explosion of state count (and the intermediate states those generate), you have a couple powerful tools:
   1. Identifying and routing out divergent items (aka ensuring items get more similar as they progress through automation)
   2. Reunifying divergent paths, instead of building branches

If you want to go back and automate a class of work that&#x27;s being routed out, write a new automation flow explicitly targeting it. Don&#x27;t try and kludge into into some giant spaghetti monolith that can handle everything.
PS: This also has the side effect of simplifying and concluding discussions about &quot;What should we do in this circumstance?&quot; with other stakeholders. Which for more complex multi-type cases can be never-ending.
PPS: And for god&#x27;s sake, never target automation of 100% of incoming workload. Ever. Iteratively approach it, but accept reaching it may be impossible.</span>

                              <span>One of the most valuable life lessons is you can&#x27;t get anyone else to care about what you want them to care about basically ever. You need to focus on the things you can control and one of the things you can&#x27;t control is what someone else is going to care about.
So if you want something done and someone else has to agree, you have to figure out how the thing you want coincides somehow with their interests and concerns.
Then you explain the thing you want to them in terms of how it advances/affects the interests and concerns of the other person. So in the framing of TFA, product are never ever ever under any circumstances going to give a shit about your architecture proposal (because that is entirely in the domain of your concerns). But they may care about how the architecture is going to prevent them from delivering features that are on the roadmap coming up and how you have a solution that can fix that for example (because now you are in the domain of their concerns).  Notice this is not just &quot;your architecture proposal&quot;, it is how your architecture proposal is going to get them what they want, and if you want to do this you need to think deeply and make sure you really understand what they want, not just what you want.
You&#x27;re not trying to change their mind. You&#x27;re trying to get what you want by showing them how it will also get them something they want.
I&#x27;m putting this here because I really wish someone had told me this 25 years ago near the start of my career.</span>

                              <span>While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries&#x27; economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.</span>

This isn&#x27;t something that commonly known (even judging by comments here) but in the publicly viewable metadata of every upload it contains the uploader&#x27;s IA account email address.

                              <span>Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the &quot;break it up&quot; camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.
As for the rebuttal of &quot;bUt ThE gDp&quot;, there&#x27;s a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&amp;A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There&#x27;s another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart&#x27;s Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.
It&#x27;s worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&amp;T and Microsoft&#x27;s own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.</span>

                              <span>My concern, and IMO what should be the overwhelming concern of the maintainers, is not the code that is being written, or the code that will be written, but all the code that has been written, and will never be touched again. A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.
For those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more &#x27;serious&#x27;, &#x27;professional&#x27; language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain&#x27;t that.</span>

                              <span>I think I disagree with most of the comments here stating it’s premature to give the Nobel to AlphaFold.
I’m in biotech academia and it has changed things already. Yes the protein folding problem isn’t “solved” but no problem in biology ever is. Comparing to previous bio/chem Nobel winners like Crispr, touch receptors, quantum dots, click chemistry, I do think AlphaFold already has reached sufficient level of impact.</span>

                              <span>Demis Hasabis has a really interesting and unusual CV for a nobel laureate [1], he started his career in AI game programming (he worked e.g. on Popoulous II, Syndicate, Theme Park for Bullfrog, and later for Lionhead Studios on Black &amp; White) before doing a PhD in neuroscience, becoming an entrepreneur and starting DeepMind. I would say this is a refreshing and highly uncommon pick for a nobel prize, really cool to see that you don&#x27;t have to be a university professor anymore to do this kind of impactful research.

                              <span>When I first heard the maxim that an intelligent person should be able to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time, I was naive to think it meant weighing them for pros and cons. Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.
Concretely related to the topic, I&#x27;ve often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I&#x27;ll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what&#x27;s going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.
My goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?</span>

ISO isn’t useful in the author’s use-case. That’s fine, it is their project to do as they will. ISOs may still have uses elsewhere, such as PXE boot or just a near universally mountable read only container.
The author’s point to the age of the original ISO standard is irrelevant. Many old technologies are reliable and widely adopted, which in and of itself may make it superior to more modern technologies.
Author’s project, author’s will. But that was difficult to read due to their attitude and beyond the author’s use case, didn’t provide a reason for universally retiring ISO.</span>

...I may be talking about recent days, but hey.
My friend&#x27;s interjection came with a wry smile. &quot;You want to be likeable?&quot;
Obviously I paused at this question. It sounded vain and shallow, but this is Asia. Results matter more than intentions, as our parents would oft prove by pointing to our tests.

It&#x27;s a good way to make sure the RSS/Atom version of your posts comes out looking right, the links work and point to the correct posts, the feed works at all, the images load in image-based posts, and so on.

For those who don&#x27;t know, Mastodon is a platform where you can have (in my case) micro-blog posts of 500 words or less, as well as share photos. People can comment on what you wrote or repost it. They can also give you a little dopamine boost by clicking a star to indicate they liked what you posted. In that way, it is structured similarly to Twitter (X), Threads, and BlueSky.
Where Twitter and Threads are corporate-owned and centralized, Mastodon is just a platform, and anyone can get the software and set up their own server if they are tech-savvy. It can be confusing for newcomers to decide which server they want to join, but the good news is that you can join more than one, and you can also mov…</span>

Vine jeg selv drikker
Til priser omtrent som i vinenes hjemlande

Det bliver minimalistisk, skævt og personligt. For når jeg bygger den forretning, jeg selv ville elske at handle i, kan det ikke være anderledes.
Jeg genstarter snart min vinforretning.

                              <span>A key question in economic policy is how labor market tightness affects wage inflation and ultimately prices. In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.</span>

The main problem with Blogs in 1997 is that it didn&#x27;t take long to realize nobody else cared about it.
The good thing about Blogs in 2024 is that you go into it knowing nobody will care about it. How Fucking Refreshing.
These days there are places to connect in 300 characters or less, places to manage &amp; moderate a growing community, and there are billionaire owned communities to help you become disappointed in your friends and family.
Sounds tedious AF.
I miss the ancient times when a simple RSS reader allowed people to lurk in the manner they preferred.
When an introvert could get a word in.
When you could fucking curse if it pleased you, because you&#x27;re an adult and sometimes things suck.
Ya know?!?
So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do here.
Curse.
But also share. With no pressure to be heard. And no pressure to respond.
If nothing else, a time capsule.
Of my journey in game development, and perhaps someday in setting up a studio. Video games have always been a wonderful escape for me. I&#x27;d call my game studio &quot;Escape Element&quot;. So that&#x27;ll be the blog&#x27;s name too.
But don&#x27;t be confused. This blog will be my personal take on things.
You could find all sorts of stuff here. It could be gamedev related stuff like art, music, or code (I dabble in all) ... or...
I may just need to rant about how stupid people are stupid.
Whatever is taking my attention at any given moment... I&#x27;m probably either in love with or pissed off at it, and it&#x27;s well past time I let the universe know about it.
If following along sounds like it may provide you with an element of escape, come on back.</span>

                              <span>On September 24 2024, the Commander Rules Committee put out their quarterly update detailing the newest batch of changes to the format. These changes consisted of banning four cards from the format: Dockside Extortionist, Jeweled Lotus, Mana Crypt, and Nadu, Winged Wisdom.
Less than a week later, the Commander RC – the independent group of fans who had controlled the game’s most popular format for over a decade – was no more.
What follows is an attempt at understanding how the world&#x27;s most popular card game got to this point.
A brief explanation of Commander
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar: Commander is a casual Magic variant that has, in the last 10 years, become the most popular and widespread form of the game. In Commander, players play free-for-all multiplayer games, typically with four players, …</span>

It&#x27;s also have the cost of a cafe domain and I like the idea of tying all of my various sites into subdomains around my &quot;city&quot;. Much like how folks have a &quot;.town&quot; or &quot;.space&quot;. It&#x27;s also better than constantly buying a million domains when I&#x27;m bored and want to start a new project. 😂 Three more are expiring this month; are you all proud of me?
By the end of the month I should have this Bear blog with the new domain and darker color themes more often than light color themes. I realize it&#x27;s ok to just do what you want with a personal blog. I have other websites that I can focus on better readability (like a dev blog) with light and dark modes.</span>

&quot;You should try to write at least a little bit of music every day.&quot;
This is bad advice.
For a multitude of reasons that I won&#x27;t get into here, I&#x27;ve had a terrible few months. Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I&#x27;ve still been making music, but it&#x27;s been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can&#x27;t come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven&#x27;t had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you&#x27;ve figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.
But what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.
Starting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.
Let go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.
Begin with just one post. It doesn&#x27;t have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.
When the weekend comes, maybe you&#x27;ll sit down and create an &quot;About&quot; page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.
Step by step, you&#x27;ll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It&#x27;s your blog, you set the rules – no one else.
Soon, you&#x27;ll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.

&gt;Too poor to pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to not pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to not even bother with not paying taxes.</span>

                              <span>These all look reasonable to me.
I especially go back and forth on attribute inheritance (it can be disabled via the htmx.config.disableInheritance option)
Three of the criticisms boil down to the fact that client-side state doesn&#x27;t always play well w/htmx swaps (especially the simple ones) which is absolutely true.
And events can get crazy.  They are powerful, but crazy and at times hard to debug.  Such is event-driven life.
The one thing I don&#x27;t agree with is the default queuing mode: it is not to cancel an existing request and replace it.  Instead it is to keep the current request in flight and queue one and only one additional request.  I&#x27;d need to sit down w/them to see if they were misinterpreting something, using the hx-sync attribute to implement the behavior they mention, or if there is a bug.
I would also like to take this opportunity to market our mug for people who don&#x27;t like htmx:

In LATAM, dock workers make sure this goes undetected. I know of an IE who was championing a dock worker scheduling optimization algo, typical Operations Management stuff. Dude was killed.
I&#x27;d like to think that this kind of things do not happen here. But every time I&#x27;ve thought along those lines, I&#x27;ve been mistaken. It&#x27;s just happens at a different scale.</span>

                              <span>From October 4–6, 2024, CADTM Europe organized its autumn meetings. Over 200 people took part. They included activists from India, Mali, Spain, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Morocco, Mexico, Brazil, Netherlands, France, Burkina Fasso, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many were activists from Liège, with a significant proportion being young people. It&#x27;s an autumn festival unlike any we&#x27;ve seen since 2019, with a fighting, militant, anti-racist, and anti-fascist spirit. Friday, October 4: Screening (...)

                              <span>In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it&#x27;s 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail.
It&#x27;s my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren&#x27;t operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.)
Lot of preamble to say: no, I don&#x27;t think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.</span>

[Our comrade P. Kropotkin, having been asked by the Swedish Professor G. Steffen[1] to give his opinion upon the present war, gave it in a letter which we reproduce, with the additions he made to it in the three last paragraphs.]
 DEAR STEFFEN, — You ask my opinion’ about the war. I have expressed it on several occasions in France, and the present events, unfortunately, only reinforce it. I consider that the duty of every one who cherishes the ideals of human progress altogether, and especially those that were inscribed by the European proletarians on the banner of the International Working Men’s Associ…</span>

                              <span>I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.
One guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I&#x27;m afraid it will end up the same way.
Writing forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.
Of course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).
One annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.
On the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.
While I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)
P.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?</span>

                              <span>As interest in understanding the economic impacts of climate change grows, the climate economics and finance literature has developed a number of indices to quantify climate risks. Various approaches have been employed, utilizing firm-level emissions data, financial market data (from equity and derivatives markets), or textual data. Focusing on the latter approach, we conduct descriptive analyses of six text-based climate risk indices from published or well-cited papers. In this blog post, we highlight the differences and commonalities across these indices.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

                              <span>from Dean Baker It is more than a bit bizarre reading pieces that talk about automation or job-killing AI as something new and alien. These are forms of productivity growth. They allow more goods and services to be produced for each hour of human labor. Productivity growth is usually thought of as a good thing. […]</span>
