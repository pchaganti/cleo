                              <span>With the rise of generative AI (genAI) tools such as ChatGPT, many worry about the tools’ potential displacement effects in the labor market and the implications for income inequality. In supplemental questions to the February 2024 Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), we asked a representative sample of U.S. residents about their experience with genAI tools. We find that relatively few people have used genAI, but that those who have used it have a bleaker outlook on its impacts on jobs and future inequality.</span>

They also favor ethnic and/or religious homogeneity. They hold to anti-immigrant views even though they spell economic suicide for their countries. Their birthrates falling, European countries need immigrants to survive. The same holds true for the United States and most of Asia. But that hasn’t stopped these political forces from building walls, erecting bureaucratic obstacles, and even expelling people. More

                              <span>What began as a war of collective punishment following October 7, 2023 quickly exploded into a full-scale genocide against the people of Gaza. Israel deployed the familiar trope about Hamas using civilians as “human shields” to justify the merciless targeting of population centers, dropping U.S. bombs on homes, hospitals, schools, and overcrowded refugee camps across the narrow strip of land that is home to some two million Palestinians.
Using starvation as a weapon, Israel has blocked most humanitarian aid from entering Gaza and brought the territory’s health care system to the brink of collapse. Lives spared by Israeli airstrikes face hell on earth, displaced many times over by the attacks while enduring famine, disease, and unimaginable psychological trauma. Among the more than 40,000 deaths accounted for in the official death toll, at least 11,000 children have been murdered by U.S. bombs, and another estimated 10,000 casualties remain buried under the mountains of rubble that is now Gaza’s landscape.

                              <span>Article starts mentioning 4GL&#x27;s - a term I have not heard in a long, long time.
COBOL&#x27;s promise was that it was human-like text, so we wouldn&#x27;t need programmers anymore.  A lot like &quot;low code&quot; platforms, and now LLM generated code.
The problem is that the average person doesn&#x27;t know how to explain &amp; solve a problem in sufficient detail to get a working solution.  When you get down to breaking down that problem... you become a programmer.
The main lesson of COBOL is that it isn&#x27;t the computer interface/language that necessitates a programmer.</span>

                              <span>Custom fit lightweight wheelchairs are expensive. My Ti-Lite (one of the most popular lightweight chair brands) Aero Z starts at $3k and goes up quickly with wheels and backrest and casters and various other options that I need for sitting 16 hours a day without creating more problems. Insurance covers this for me every 5 years, but of course that&#x27;s not a luxury every one has. Most plans don&#x27;t cover DME 100%.
What Zack and Cambry are doing is great.
(edit) I’d like to add that I think part of being able to drive costs down is that they’re not offering these via insurance so they sidestep the need for FDA approval to market it as a medical device (hence the company name), CMS approval and HCPCS coding and all the regulatory costs that come with that.
Now don&#x27;t get me started on power wheelchair cost...</span>

                              <span>I manage a medium-sized browser extension at work. We also offer(ed) it on Firefox. But I have spent the past year struggling to get back into Mozilla store after a manual review. As far as I can tell, there are maybe two reviewers that are based in Europe (Romania?). The turn around time is long when I am in the US, and it has been rife with this same kind of &quot;simple mistake&quot; that takes 2 weeks to resolve. 
&quot;You need a privacy policy&quot;–we already have one. &quot;You are using machine generated and minified code&quot;–no you are looking at the built code, not the included source. &quot;We cannot reproduce your source&quot;-that&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow instructions and are in the wrong directory.

                              <span>I think it’s reasonable to expect that one of Firefox’s most popular extension publishers gets a higher tier of review service. Gorhill (and other top extension devs) are providing real value to Firefox, and have demonstrated good behavior for years.
This doesn’t mean they should get to publish whatever they want, but if a reviewer is about to reject a high profile plugin, they should get a second set of eyes on it. Which would have obviously caught the mistake here.
Feels like another “Firefox is underinvested in developer relations” story, which is surprising given how much they rely on them.
Edit: honestly the idea that gorhill doesn’t have a dedicated rep at Mozilla is baffling to me. According to their stats the extension has 8.4 million users. They should call him on the phone to let him know there’s a problem with his extension.</span>

                              <span>The fact that ESPN itself has a sports betting app tells you all you need to know about the perversion of sports now that gambling is blessed by the government.
I think I can live with the legalization of sports betting if there are strong restrictions against marketing and advertising. If you want to ruin your life that&#x27;s your decision, and you can always just take the same amount of money and bet it on the stock market. But the way that advertising has its tentacles in our culture now... it&#x27;s bad.</span>

                              <span>Recent events have heightened awareness of systemic risk stemming from nonbank financial sectors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.</span>

Huge new appropriations for nuclear weapons are voted under the euphemism of “modernization.” And here’s a sad irony: The few members of Congress willing to urgently warn about the danger of nuclear war often stoke that danger with calls for “victory” in the Ukraine war. Instead, what’s urgently needed is a sober push for actual diplomacy to end it. More

The second, by the United Nations General Assembly, two months later, set, for the first time in history, an exact time frame of when the Israeli occupation of Palestine must end. More

I&#x27;ve been writing on the internet for most of the time that I&#x27;ve been alive. I&#x27;ve done it on blogs, I&#x27;ve done it on social media. I&#x27;ve done it for money and I&#x27;ve done it for free. I&#x27;ve done it on Tumblr and on more than one defunct media vertical and in interactive fiction.
Cohost was the first place where it felt like, consistently, someone was always reading. Something about the site&#x27;s design and user culture created a magical space where people approached things with openness and curiosity and willingness to give their time and attention.
This felt like a place where you could write about anything and people would care. I&#x27;ve talked about the Put your Helmet…</span>

it really is precious, sometimes. to look at something and be able to experience it with your senses. it&#x27;s novel, most days. you just do it without thinking.
but then there&#x27;s times when you experience an intangible unreality so strong that it becomes a force in your life that can&#x27;t be measured. we don&#x27;t have scales for that, or weights that add up the unreal intangible space that exists between little lights in a grid &amp; your brain.
there is a space, somewhere within the imagination, that fills in bit by bit over time. like reading a book, making the world come to life, hearing voices, making up the parts that the author never tells you. internet spa…</span>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus. Also known as, at this time, the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force. Where she became an air traffic controller, as it is also known, air is notoriously difficult to control at any given time of the day or night.</span>

Do you want to present your blogging timeline in a stylish way? Or perhaps have a unique style for your micro thoughts? Or keep a changelog for documenting your blog’s development?

In the year 3535, ain&#x27;t gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie, everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.

In the year 5555, your arms hangin&#x27; limp at your sides, your legs got nothin&#x27; to do, some machine&#x27;s doin&#x27; that for you.

As an aside, I&#x27;m starting to get annoyed with the &quot;we moved fast and broke things, we&#x27;re smol indie hackers&quot; defense that has been popping up more lately in various contexts. The whole incident started because they got venture capital for their fork and were in a startup accelerator for several months: that&#x27;s not moving fast or being indie.</span>

This is not new. This is a battle as old as time.
Want to keep out poor people? Require them to live on campus instead of locally at home. Want to keep out the wrong kind of person? Start requiring college essays to get a &quot;culture fit&quot;. Or add &quot;geographic diversity&quot; to get less NYC Jews, or require &quot;well rounded&quot; candidates that do more than pass tests to keep out Asian Americans. Or conduct interviews so you can see their race in-person without asking for it on a form.

Important to note that this is the only enforcement mechanism. You get put on a naughty list.
Will be interesting to see how important that is to the selective universities in the state. I don’t see how being named and shamed on an official government website is much different than the status quo of being named and shamed in a media report on legacy admissions.</span>

                              <span>I love everything about this.
There is this undercurrent to our technology landscape. A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost.  I can only describe it as a live exploration of concepts _through_ technology, where functional fixedness is a foreign concept, including in the shared experience of social construct; everything becomes parts to be remixed in a way.  In this place people just do things that, by way of having fun, just becomes art.  It&#x27;s emergent gameplay just by following a solitary &quot;rule of cool.&quot;
I saw this page and was immediately transported back to the late 1990&#x27;s and early &#x27;aughts.  The kind of &quot;I glued these things together and just look&quot; attitude that graced the pages of hackaday.com and slashdot.org.  LED &quot;throwies&quot; come to mind.
In this case we have a de-facto art installation.  I imagine that this was probably put together with odds and ends, maybe installed illegally, and probably doesn&#x27;t have longevity in mind for its construction. It lightheartedly challenges some conventions, challenges ideas about privacy, brushes up against copyright, and is entertaining to boot. Most importantly, how it was made is less interesting than what it _does_, and where it carries the conversation of the observer.  Or maybe: that&#x27;s the point.</span>

                              <span>NotebookLM&#x27;s is incredibly good at generating the affect and structure of a quality podcast.
This is in-line with all art, music, and video created by LMM at the moment. They are imitating a structure and affect, the quality of the content is largely irrelevant.
I think the interesting thing is that most people don&#x27;t really care, and AI is not to blame for that.
Most books published today have the affect of a book, but the author doesn&#x27;t really have anything to say. Publishing a book is not about communicating ideas, but a means to something else. It&#x27;s not meant to stand on its own.
The reason so much writing, podcasting, and  music is vulnerable to AI disruption is that quality has already become secondary.</span>

                              <span>Expectations can play a significant role in driving economic outcomes, with central banks factoring market sentiment into policy decisions and market participants forming their own assumptions about monetary policy. But how well do central banks understand the expectations of market participants—and vice versa? Our model, developed in a recent paper, features a dynamic game between (i) a monetary authority that cannot commit to an inflation target and (ii) a set of market participants that understand the incentives created by that credibility problem. In this post, we describe the game, a type of Keynesian beauty contest: its main novelty is that each side attempts, with varying degrees of accuracy, to forecast the other’s beliefs, resulting in new findings regarding the levels and trajectories of inflation.</span>

                              <span>There has been a deplorable consistency in the remarks and efforts of Robert M. Gates over the past four decades.  In the 1980s, Gates was a major player in the falsification of intelligence regarding the Soviet Union, designed to justify unneeded increases in the defense budget.  In 1986, Gates had to withdraw his name from congressional confirmation for the post of director of the Central Intelligence Agency because the majority of the Senate intelligence committee believed he was lying about his role in the infamous Iran-Contra operation.

                              <span>A crowd of 3,000 anti-tourism protesters descended on posh downtown Barcelona last July, their demeanor one of delighted malice.  They cordoned off hotels and eateries with hazard tape, as if demarcating a crime scene. They sprayed with water guns the blithe holidaymakers seated in restaurants.  Video footage showed unhappy couples and glowering young men chased from their seats by the mob, stunned at the indignity.
The protesters shouted “tourists go home.” They held signs that said “Barcelona is not for sale.” They spoke of “mass touristification” and inveighed against the greed of restaurateurs and hoteliers and Airbnb landlords profiting from the madding crowd while the average Catalan struggled to meet the skyrocketing costs of daily life. One of the protesters told an interviewer, “The city has turned completely for tourists. What we want is a city for citizens.” More

I post random thoughts and shorter things in various places. You can mostly find me on Mastodon these days, sporadically on micro.blog (that sometimes gets pushed to Mastodon), and these days on status.log (which also sometimes gets copied over to Mastodon). Anyways, I&#x27;m all over the place.
There are some fleeting thoughts I want to keep just because. I have my Mastodon profile set to delete after insert amount of time here so I want to keep a copy of it on my site.

a classic. delicious Y2K Teal. iconic. gotta love her. 4.5/5.
blueberry

barely distinguishable from the original Bondi Blue, but from what i can tell in photos online and in real life, it&#x27;s a slightly lighter color compared to bondi blue. but because of that, i think it&#x27;s missing some contrast. i don&#x27;t like it as much. 3/5
grape

underappreciated one! this color combination makes me think of the Teenz Zone at my library circa 2000. 4/5
tangerine

truthfully, my fondness for this one is 99% because of The Cheat&#x27;s computer. but it&#x27;s a fun, retrofuturistic color choice, especially with the form factor. on its own i give it a 4.5/5, but it gets elevated to 5/5 because it makes me think of Homestar.

                              <span>In a world of endless notifications, feature-bloated apps, and constant digital noise, I found myself yearning for simplicity. That&#x27;s why I created Nihil - a suite of minimalist tools designed to help you focus on what truly matters.
The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That&#x27;s the core of Nihil&#x27;s philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

What Makes Nihil Different?
Purposeful Design
Every feature in Nihil is there because …</span>

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar, a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team, sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes.
Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion.

                              <span>Excellent move by Newsom. We have a very active legislature, but it&#x27;s been extremely bandwagon-y in recent years. I support much of Wiener&#x27;s agenda, particularly his housing policy, but this bill was way off the mark.
It was basically a torpedo against open models. Market leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic weren&#x27;t really worried about it, or about open models in general. Its supporters were the also-rans like Musk [1] trying to empty out the bottom of the pack, as well as those who are against any AI they cannot control, such as antagonists of the West and wary copyright holders.

i can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but as one of the people writing tutorials and faqs and helping people learn to do things with free software during the period miller is talking about, that is absolutely what i intended to do.  and, from the number of people i knew who were excited to work on olpc, conectar igualdad, and huayra linux, i think it was actually a pretty common motivation
as a kid on bbses, fidonet, and the internet, i benefited to an unimaginable degree from other people&#x27;s generosity in sharing their learning and their inventions (which is what software is).  how could i not want to do the same?
underwritten by the nsf, the internet was a gift economy, like burning man: people giving away things of value to all comers because if you don&#x27;t do that maybe it&#x27;s because you can&#x27;t.  the good parts of it still are</span>

                              <span>I recognize the author Jascha as an incredibly brilliant ML researcher, formerly at Google  Brain and now at Anthropic.
Among his notable accomplishments, he and coauthors mathematically characterized the propagation of signals through deep neural networks via techniques from physics and statistics (mean field and free probability theory). Leading to arguably some of the most profound yet under-appreciated theoretical and experimental results in ML in the past decade. For example see “dynamical isometry” [1] and the evolution of those ideas which were instrumental in achieving convergence in very deep transformer models [2].
After reading this post and the examples given, in my eyes there is no question that this guy has an extraordinary intuition for optimization, spanning beyond the boundaries of ML and across the fabric of modern society.
We ought to recognize his technical background and raise this discussion above quibbles about semantics and definitions.
Let’s address the heart of his message, the very human and empathetic call to action that stands in the shadow of rapid technological progress:
&gt; If you are a scientist looking for research ideas which are pro-social, and have the potential to create a whole new field, you should consider building formal (mathematical) bridges between results on overfitting in machine learning, and problems in economics, political science, management science, operations research, and elsewhere.

                              <span>Well hmm. NASA decided Starliner wasn&#x27;t safe enough to use for the return journey, so the astronauts stayed on the ISS until the next ride became available.
Originally the astronauts were supposed to go back on Starliner. Now they&#x27;re taking another ride back. Is that considered a rescue? Well, it depends.
If you get left behind on an island because your ride wasn&#x27;t safe and another boat picks you up, is that a rescue? Now what if you&#x27;re 420 kilometers up and another boat has to come get you. Is that a rescue?
If there wasn&#x27;t another ride from the ISS available, would the astronauts be stranded? Yes.
In that case, if a ride suddenly became available would it be considered a rescue? Probably, yes.</span>

                              <span>My first time watching Everything, Everywhere, All At Once (EEAAO) was at a friend&#x27;s house with about ten other Asian immigrants. There&#x27;s a scene where the male lead, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), was putting googly eyes all over the lanterns and doing a sneaky shush at the camera before running away.
&quot;Oh, that&#x27;s [deadname],&quot; said someone. Laughter echoed in the living room.
Eh? That&#x27;s me?
I&#x27;ll admit, when my brain was mostly still concentrated on the movie, pre-transition, still stuck in my &quot;I have to be a man&quot; phase, I wondered if that was a snide comment. It&#x27;s very easy to read it that way because Waymond&#x27;s character is the opposite of the stereotypical male lead. He is presented as effeminate, weak, and his voice is high-pitched and lacks a full range. As a knee-jerk gut reaction, we foc…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone and welcome to my blog!
This is a project I&#x27;ve started many times before without a lot of success on several different WordPress sites—all of which no longer exist. The first was a free blog I set up when I first came to Japan in 2015 as a student. I&#x27;d seen so many blogs by other exchange students and thought it&#x27;d be pretty exciting. The only problem was that I didn&#x27;t think that anything I was doing was very exciting, so I quickly stopped doing it. I&#x27;ve tried since to make several paid sites that focus on my reading and writing book reviews. There were a lot of problems with that, most of which came down to the fact that I was extremely worried about making the &quot;perfect&quot; site even though it was just something that I wanted to do for fun. WordPress has always just also been r…</span>

Like many people in my age group, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that I grew up online.
the pre-social media years
My &quot;life online&quot; really started in the mid-2000s when I joined the forums of Crystal XP. This name probably won&#x27;t mean anything to you, but if you used Windows XP at the time, you might have seen their &quot;BricoPacks&quot;. These were 1-click installers that reskinned your entire Windows installation. Their most successful one was the Vista Inspirat one. Pretty wild stuff. Oh, and also CrystalXP was &quot;responsible&quot; for that one Tux and its myriad of variations you might see on every other Linux fanboy&#x27;s profile.
But like I said, they had forums. I joined those forums after r…</span>

This long-form essay was sent to us for publication by “some communist study group“. It discusses the historical role of Ukraine in the contemporary political economy, the response from radicals in the West towards the Russian invasion, and the material effects on the global political economy emanating from the disruption of a major bread basket, specifically with an eye towards revolt. The questions raised here are important not just for the current moment, but also for any social movement that desires to truly engage with “present state of t…</span>

As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I understand that Charlie Munger&#x27;s observation &quot;“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” is applicable everywhere - including science.
Academic scientists&#x27; careers are driven by publishing, citations and impact.  Arguably some have figured how to game the system to advance their careers.  Science be damned.</span>

                              <span>This work from Google (original Nature paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w) has been credibly criticized by several researchers in the EDA CAD discipline. These papers are of interest:
- A rebuttal by a researcher within Google who wrote this at the same time as the &quot;AlphaChip&quot; work was going on (&quot;Stronger Baselines for Evaluating Deep Reinforcement Learning in Chip Placement&quot;): http://47.190.89.225/pub/education/MLcontra.pdf
- The 2023 ISPD paper from a group at UCSD (&quot;Assessment of Reinforcement Learning for Macro Placement&quot;): https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/396/c396.p...
- A paper from Igor Markov which critically evaluates the &quot;AlphaChip&quot; algorithm (&quot;The False Dawn: Reevaluating Google&#x27;s Reinforcement Learning for Chip Macro Placement&quot;): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09633
In short, the Google authors did not fairly evaluate their RL macro placement algorithm against other SOTA algorithms: rather they claim to perform better than a human at macro placement, which is far short of what mixed-placement algorithms are capable of today. The RL technique also requires significantly more compute than other algorithms and ultimately is learning a surrogate function for placement iteration rather than learning any novel representation of the placement problem itself.
In full disclosure, I am quite skeptical of their work and wrote a detailed post on my website: https://vighneshiyer.com/misc/ml-for-placement/</span>

                              <span>These sorts of articles raise so many thoughts and emotions in me.  I was trained as a computational biologist with a little lab work and ran gels from time to time.  Personally, I hated gels- they&#x27;re finicky, messy, ugly, and don&#x27;t really tell you very much.  But molecular biology as a field runs on gels- it&#x27;s the priimary source of results for almost everything in molbio.  I have seen more talks and papers that rested entirely a single image of a gel which is really just some dark bands.
At the same time, I was a failed scientist: my gels weren&#x27;t as interesting, or convincing compared to the ones done by the folks who went on to be more successful.  At the time (20+ years ago) it didn&#x27;t occur to me that anybody would intentionally modify images of gels to promote the results they claimed, although I did assume that folks didn&#x27;t do a good job of organizing their data, and occasionally published papers that were wrong simply because they confused two images.
Would I have been more successful if fewer people (and I now believe this is a common occurrence) published fraudulent images of gels?  Maybe, maybe not.  But the more important thing is that everybody just went along with this.  I participated in many journal clubs where folks would just flip to Figure 3, assume the gel was what the authors claimed, and proceed to agree with (or disagree with) the results and conclusions uncritically.  Whereas I would spend a lot of time trying to understand what experiment was actually run, and what th e data showed.</span>

Financial fraud can cause suicides and ruin in lives, sure, but I feel like academic fraud just sets the whole of humanity back? I also feel that through my life I&#x27;ve (maybe wrongly) placed a great deal of respect and trust in scientists, mostly that they understand that their work is of the upmost importance and so the downstream consequences of mucking around are just too grave. Stuff like this seems to bother me more than it rationally should. Are people who commit this type of science fraud just really evil humans? Am I over thinking this? Do scientists go to jail for academic fraud?</span>

                              <span>I am always glad to see people pursuing creating their own programming language. More people should give it a try, IMHO.
A tricky thing that comes up with Rust comparisons is that often, Rust has a feature that&#x27;s weird or hard to use, but it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s the only solution that makes sense within the constraints Rust has placed upon itself. Clicking some links gets me to https://git.yzena.com/Yzena/Yc/src/branch/master/docs/yao/de...
&gt; Yao&#x27;s biggest goals are: Correctness, Convenience, Performance, in that order.
Having clear goals is a great thing when making a language, because they give you guidance on what is appropriate to include and what is not.
Rust has certainly demonstrated having similar goals, but in a slightly different order: Correctness, Performance, and then Convenience. So it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if Yao could do some things better than Rust, in accordance with its goals. But that also means that sometimes, Rust would be useful where Yao cannot be. Everything is tradeoffs.
Incidentally, I actually think that figuring out what your values are, and what your needs are, is a great way to pick a programming language. Decide what matters to you as an engineer, and then find a language that shares similar values. I gave a conference talk a few years back on this idea, and how I viewed Rust&#x27;s values at the time https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-tradeoffs/
This was based off of bcantrill&#x27;s Platform as a Reflection of Values, which was very influential on me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Xhx970_JKX4
If you&#x27;ve ever heard about Oxide&#x27;s focus on values, this is some of the older background on that.</span>

When asked what their favorite part of the trip was, they responded..
The hot tub.
At the hotel.
My kids light up the most when I am fully engaged with them, fully present, entertaining their ideas, and asking questions.
Their favorite family trip so far?  When we traveled to Arkansas to mine for crystals.  AKA, dig in the dirt all day.  They saw it on a YouTube video. They asked to go.  So we obliged. I had never been to Arkansas.  It&#x27;s beautiful.
We stayed at a resort, Diamonds Old West Cabins, with a huge playground outside the cabins, archery, and a bubble party every evening at 6 pm.
They still talk about that trip.</span>

Western industrial culture was based on substance - getting real shit done. There  was always a lot of scammery around it, but the bedrock goal was to make physical things happen - build things, invent things, deliver things, innovate.
PR and ad culture was there to support that. The goal was to change values and behaviours to get people to Buy More Stuff. OK.
Then around the time the Internet arrived, industry was off-shored, and the culture started to become one of appearance and performance, not of substance and action.

                              <span>It&#x27;s from my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic when they can actually see you hurting. For the millionth time in my life, I wished depression manifested like the flu or some other recognizable disease, just to make it simple for me and for the people around me.
How much easier would it be if mental illness were physical - visible and tangible? A runny nose and a sore throat - people would understand. They would offer me tissues, a warm cup of tea, and a sympathetic get well soon. But a shitty compilation of mental symptoms and an even shittier chemical make up? How do I explain an intangible pain?
What can I say, anyway? Sometimes I feel like I am carrying around a heavy suitcase full of sadness everywhere that I go. The smallest task feels impossible. Everything is dull yet heavy, all at once.  Everything matters too much yet nothing matters. Anything would be easier to explain than what&#x27;s really going on.
I think this topic further resonates with me as someone with high-functioning depression. I recall an attempt to open up about my state with a close friend, who reacted with amusement and disbelief, as if I was exchanging lighthearted banter. But you are so put together, Tala. You are successful, ace tests, and excel at work - it must be a misdiagnosis.
I was overwhelmed with shame that later transformed into rage. I found it impossible to articulate the depth of pain - that yes, I am waking up everyday, leaving bed, fulfilling my obligations. But I am still struggling, still fighting a relentless battle with the energy I have left.
And there are millions of us suffering a silent, invisible battle against our mental illnesses, while we present a facade of normalcy to world. Because sometimes silence is the easier option.</span>

This is a bit crass of course; that page is for things I generally don’t want to do and isn’t meant for explanation, exceptions and nuance. Of course there are services I subscribe to - I currently pay for Proton, Spotify and Apple Fitness.
One reason is, of course, that these services don’t offer lifetime payment. But in their cases, I understand how that’s not feasible - their services are heavily dependent on serving content via cloud and development of new content and improved features. The bandwidth needs to be paid for, artists, devs and fitness trainers need to be paid constantly.
But I try to limit what I subscribe to. Everyone has a maximum amount of subscriptions they’re willing to have at the same time and p…</span>

I haven’t gotten a chance to explain it and since it’s nearing the end of the month, and a similar post will be popping up shortly, I figured I’d explain what I’m trying to do.
It’s a reverse POSSE of sorts that I’m calling #microthoughts

POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content.

In one of those unfortunate coincidences in life, I had the opportunity to relocate to the United States, while scientist was offered a postdoctoral research position in Canada—both at the same time.
After putting all the cards (offers, spreadsheets, etc.) on the table, my wife rejected the offer from the Canadian university, and I accepted the one in the U.S.
In Canada, scientist would have had a salary and health insurance, but I wouldn’t. Additionally, I wouldn’t be able to work as her dependent. In the U.S., however, we would both have everything—health insurance, the abil…</span>
