                              <span>Don’t jump straight in. Observe and see how people are moving before you get involved.
Look out for each other. If someone falls over, help them get up. You are there to have fun together.
Start at the sides and work your way in for a more intense experience. Stay on the outside until you get your bearings. Then, when you’re ready, venture further into the center to get really wild.
Never try and intentionally hurt someone. If you get hit by accident or intentionally do not retaliate.
Treat everyone with respect and stay safe!

                              <span>We often trivialize former U.S. President Donald Trump’s racism—we consider his bigotry in passing while ruminating at length on his legal woes and alleged cognitive deterioration.

                              <span>I clearly remember my first day at an UNRWA school in a refugee camp in Gaza. I was five years of age. It felt like my life was over.

But the voice in my head has been awfully quiet, so today I&#x27;m going to sit here and coax him out.
Last week my dad flew to New Jersey for a business trip and did me a favor by bringing a bag of my clothes with him, so I took the train over to Newark (EWR) to meet him and pick up my stuff. While waiting for him I killed some time riding in the airport Airtrain that whisks you from one terminal to another. The Airtrain is so strange. The train cars are absurdly small — I&#x27;m used to them being subway sized — and fit probably no more than 10 people each. I spent a few minutes alone in my tiny metal capsule and did not pass up the opportunity to…</span>

                              <span>Hi 👋  I’m JC (Probably)
But you can call me Jedda.
🚧 This page is a work in progress, but I too, am always a work in progress, so I think it all works out.
Based in the Bay Area (CA), but originally from the East Coast. I’m a Product Manager by profession, photography hobbyist, avid reader, and a creative by nature. I have a 12-year old dachshund named Cocoa (Chanel), who pretty much runs my life.
I’m not great at writing (or talking) about myself. If you stick around, little bits and pieces of my life do surface itself in the things I create and write.
This blog doesn’t have a specific theme. It’s mostly anything and everything that pops into my head. It was initially started as a place for quick notes, that turned into long form thoughts, but now is just an overall place for my primarily text-based everything.
I’d love to hear from you, even if it’s just to say hello. I’m typically available on socials such as 🐘Mastodon but can easily be reached via email through my Letterbird (or the email embedded in my posts). If you’d like to subscribe via RSS, you can do so 📡 here.
Welcome to my Notes. I am so glad you&#x27;re here.</span>

                              <span>New York City&#x27;s cultural and demographic landscape is wide and deep; today we focus on the narrative of the Chinese Diaspora in New York which offers a compelling study in migration, community dynamics, and urban development.
At the heart of this narrative lies the transformation of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, a neighborhood once bustling with the vibrant intricacies of Chinese culture, now a shadow of its former self, restaurants dwindling, residents leaving, and culture evaporating. The assertion that Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown has succumbed to the relentless march of urban evolution is not just an observation; it&#x27;s a stark reality. The exodus, driven by the prohibitive costs of Manhattan living, has rerouted the lifeblood of this community to Flushing, at the end of the Queens-bound 7 line, marki…</span>

It&#x27;s May 8th, 2022 and the market has officially left &quot;easy-mode&quot; and entered into a straight grind down. Gone are the days of just buying $NIO at the end of the day because it closed up at least 1 ATR on elevated rvol and you&#x27;ll wake up with it a couple points higher, just cause!
Now, we are seeing the high flyers that are up in the air getting hit on earnings and selling off aggressively. The r*tarded trade that Tim and I are taking in our joint account is shorting earnings day 1 under premarket lows and it&#x27;s working! We aren&#x27;t crushing it, but it&#x27;s working.

                              <span>I found this blog site a few weeks back. I have a very hectic schedule at the moment and don’t have too much time for writing.
But I do seem to have time for browsing what others write while I wait on the mundane waits in life, which normally translates to waiting in a line, waiting in a waiting room (probably the most obviously named room in the english language)  or waiting for the dog to stop sniffing around and pee.
In these little moments, the phone comes out and I look at the recent posts. I’m fascinated by what you write. The honesty, the freeform, the choice of blog styles, the navigation tabs (I’m really happy with the “nope” and will be adding one soon), all of it.
I’m just really glad to be here. And I want to thank you all for your contributions. You make my world brighter.
And for those of you that think “no one will see this”. You are wrong. Someone will.
So keep writing please!</span>

                              <span>This post is intended to be the most basic of rundowns in getting a top job offer for Carnegie Mellon SCS freshman.
While the following may sound annoyingly prestige-oriented, and compensation-driven, it is bluntly intended to reflect the realities of an increasingly competitive professional landscape. There is a lot of yapping, beware. Get some Tsaocaa boba and settle in.
About me, for context, I grew up low-income in a suburban town with immigrant parents that never attended high school. I took up to Calc AB in high school, and I only knew basic web development coming into CMU. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University this semester. My highest offer this year included a total compensation of $550k. I had offers from trading firms, two FAANGs, tiktok.

appreciate you for being here.
i&#x27;ve always wanted to be an astronaut but i found myself making bits fly instead. i love that which is aesthetic and i take great pride in designing beautiful distributed systems. i enjoy dota, strawberries, and software (in that order).
i like to think reasonably, objectively, creatively, simply, and always with the future in mind. i&#x27;m very strongly opinionated, but i love nothing more than being corrected correctly. i love learning experiences.
the majority of my posts will probably be irrelevant to you, especially since i enjoy yapping, but peruse at your leisure.
always happy to chat on twitter.
see you sometime,
boon</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m pleased to share a new Bear Blog theme paying homage to the classic vampire film, Nosferatu. I was inspired to create this one after watching the trailer for the upcoming 2024 remake. The theme has an atmospheric aesthetic that evokes the haunting tone of the original movie. I&#x27;ve designed this theme to be ideal for blogs focused on horror, Gothic literature, or film reviews. The font treatment is also ideal for long-form book reviews or essays. I hope you enjoy exploring the CSS and customizing it to your liking. Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I think I hear rats scratching in the walls...

                              <span>Yesterday, I launched the July Reply blog challenge. I like the idea and hoped there would be a lot of interest, but so far, it&#x27;s been lukewarm.
For the past few weeks, I have posted something new every day. Many of the texts that I&#x27;ve been proud of have barely gotten any attention at all.
“Why am I even doing this for?”
I heard myself thinking that today. It&#x27;s so incredibly stupid and ridiculous that it&#x27;s embarrassing to even mention it.
I&#x27;m doing this because I love it. If others like it too, great, but that&#x27;s not the main purpose.
No one likes everything we do, whether we&#x27;re a small blogger or the biggest artist in the world. On the other hand, we will always think that our latest creations are our best. Why else would we continue?
We are all different—equally different.
You&#x27;re sitting on the world&#x27;s best joke, looking forward to the laughter, but you&#x27;re met with the reaction: “Is that all?”
Different.
You tell someone about the greatest movie ever made and then ask what they thought: “It wasn&#x27;t to my taste, so I turned it off after half an hour.&quot;
Different.
You like watching football. I hate sports.
Different.
What a wonderful diversity!</span>

                              <span>U.S. inflation surged in the early post-COVID period, driven by several economic shocks such as supply chain disruptions and labor supply constraints. Following its peak at 6.6 percent in September 2022, core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has come down rapidly over the last two years, falling to 3.6 percent recently. What explains the rapid shifts in U.S. inflation dynamics? In a recent paper, we show that the interaction between supply chain pressures and labor market tightness amplified the inflation surge in 2021. In this post, we argue that these same forces that drove the nonlinear rise in inflation have worked in reverse since late 2022, accelerating the disinflationary process. The current episode contrasts with periods where the economy was hit by shocks to either imported inputs or to labor alone.</span>

                              <span>I struggle with this thing, of remembering certain people in such a golden light. Before this seems like a post talking about not-so-good people, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s about perfectly nice people.
The thing is, the way I tend to remember people is by how they made me feel. Few people in my life have made me feel like a real, raw person when talking to them. But some have. Some of these people are miles away, and have maybe always been miles away, both geographically and otherwise.
It&#x27;s a really painful thing, because as these memories I hold go further and further back in my memory, I don&#x27;t know what I want anymore. All I really want is to feel the way they made me feel again. Not so easy though, is it?
We&#x27;ve both grown in separate ways, and I&#x27;m grateful for where I am in my life, I think I&#x27;ve done pretty alright for myself so far. No matter what I do though, it does feel like there&#x27;s a certain hole in my life, somewhere I&#x27;m lacking greatly. The remedy is so far though. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t even exist, not anymore.</span>

                              <span>I’m not a fan of having dark mode on my site because I have a hard time choosing colors that speak to me. I like to keep things minimalistic with my colors, and for me, it’s just much easier to do with a white background. However, I know (and acknowledge) the importance of having one, and so I pushed myself to do some tinkering on the blog this morning. Besides, my eyeballs also hate me when I look at my site at night, and so I’m sure it’s the case for other people too.
I subscribe to a lot of blogs via RSS reader, but I do take the extra step to launch their site to read the post. I have a deep appreciation for those who take the time to design their site the way they want, and so I want to read their posts the way it was meant to be read. It’s kind of like: listening to an album in order because I know that the artist ordered it a specific way for people to listen to. At the same time, it’s OK if you want to shuffle the playlist if you as the consumer want to, just like it’s OK for those who read my posts to do so via an RSS feed.
Anyways, this is just a quick post to say that, if your preference is dark mode, it is now available on here. I’ll revisit my site again at night time to test out the color contrasts (since I worked on this during daytime) to see if it makes sense, or if my eyeballs are still straining to read things.
Due to this, I’ve also gone ahead and created a Changelog for my site, so I can keep track of the little (and big) changes I make on here.
Side note:
I typically do have my screens on dark mode, and so if the sites/blog I read have dark mode, I read those in dark mode. It’s a weird thing for me to want my site in a lighter background, but I do struggle with it sometimes. Thanks to those who have put up with probably burning your retinas reading my posts if you weren’t doing so in an RSS reader. I appreciate you.

I have been subbed to Claude Opus for a few months (yes, I am an earlier believer than you people). Couple of days back, I was working on a project and opened Anthropic chat. Then I realised it was showing &quot;Sonnet 3.5 - Our most intelligent model&quot; and it was seriously a major surprise.
I have been playing with with it for a couple of days now. Wrote some code ranging from Python, HTML, CSS, JSS to Pytorch and Jax. Made it do some editing and proof-reading. So far it&#x27;s been smooth sailing. Maybe we haven&#x27;t hit a wall yet (Ok I am not important enough to comment on this but you gotta remember it&#x27;s my blog).
But why vibe-check, aren&#x27;t benchmarks enough? Oversimplifying here but I think you cannot trust benchmarks blindly. There can be benchmark data leakage/overfitting to be…</span>

 There is no such thing as human society. 
 A lot of muddled thinking rests on the error that because ‘society’ is a useful noun, it must refer to a thing.

                              <span>It was exciting, to say the least. I had an exam that day, and people usually finish their exams and go on their way. The problem was I had never talked to my crush before, so I couldn&#x27;t exactly call her up to meet me. I finished my exam really early—about an hour and a half early—so that I wouldn&#x27;t miss her.
Let&#x27;s cut back to the morning of that day. I had already prepared what I wanted to say to her. But since I might talk non-stop, I decided to go with a letter (yeah, I&#x27;m old school that way—don&#x27;t judge me). I woke up and did my morning routine (yes, I do have a routine).
