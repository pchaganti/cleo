Well, for this birthday edition of our restoration project, the 307 engine has completed its full rebuild. While much of the details of how this is all done went way over my head, what I do know is all the shiny bits from the last post now live inside the engine. Not to understate the amount of back-breaking labour my father went through to get it all set up, but the orange boi has all the requisite parts strapped on and is ready to rock and roll!

It was with much excitement and a little trepidation that I approached the milestone of this engine&#x27;s 55th birthday compared to my measly 34 years of age. Would these shiny bits of expensive metal, meticulously installed into the bowels of this mysterious orange machine, reignite its thumping heartbeat in a flurry of noise and smoke?

Yes…</span>

I was curious to see how it would affect my mental health as well the amount of time I spend online. Things didn’t exactly go to plan, but I did come away with some interesting take aways and some ideas on how I want to proceed in the future.
The first two days, I didn’t log on to the internet at all. My laptop remained off, my tablet had the wi-fi turned off, and my phone was restricted to just a few apps. I forgot to turn off my email notifications (the only notifications I have on), so I saw some emails on my phone and that was fine. I didn’t respond to any, because I prefer to type on a real keyboard, but it helped me keep track of some Amazon orders as well as a few other things I had goi…</span>

                              <span>As I strolled through yet another city on a mid-week trip, I came across a cozy-looking coffee shop. Looking through the window, I saw a variety of people sitting inside. Most of them were looking at their laptops: reading, typing, and occasionally writing something down on a physical notepad. Other people were just enjoying today&#x27;s newspaper.
I had my own laptop with me, tucked away in my backpack, and that made me curious. I knew people were working in places like these, but it never really appealed to me to try the same thing. Probably due to the fact that I&#x27;ve always had a full-time job, working out of an office and without the need or time to work anywhere else. But now that I was here, on a little holiday and with some time on my hands, I felt a force that tried to drag me inside.

They pay attention to their bank accounts (if they still have them). And they think groceries were cheaper when Trump was in office, and maybe remember the stimulus payments Trump signed. (Yes, Biden’s administration sent stimulus payments too—but remember the facts. Trump set a $2,000 figure and Biden’s additional payment—a promised $2,000—turned out to be $1,400, added to a $600 payment that Congress signed off during Trump’s term.) More

What is interesting is that, by United Nations treaty, a country claims 12 nautical miles as its territorial limit; this means a large part of the waters are within Yemen’s jurisdiction. More

After more than fifty years of living in the United States, I still find it laborious to write in English.

                              <span>It&#x27;s important to note that the Do-Not-Stab header has been deprecated because one browser engine switched it on by default and requiring users to opt into stabbing hurt the bottom line of the stabbing industry, so it&#x27;s no longer respected. Luckily someone came up with General Assault Control, a non-standard alternative, which also only has one value, so you can set Sec-GAC to 1 to request websites not to assault you. By design, this header cannot be extended, so it cannot be used to distinguish brutal stabbings from a comedic pie to the face in the future.
Because of legal requirements, the General Assault Control header may not be enabled by default, as American states like Colorado require explicit opt-out (rather than explicit opt-in). This protects Colorado&#x27;s thriving stabbing and shooting industry as most users will never want to opt into being stabbed.
Despite the feature being forced to be disabled by default, the organisation behind the spec is pushing hard for customers to download fringe browsers  that implement the feature (though you may need about:config to enable it). Because of the small user base, the request not to be assaulted can be used by websites not willing to follow the standard to make their stabbings and shootings more precise. End users can request a JSON file from the web server containing the supposed support for the GAC header, but requesting this URL may be used to kick the user in the teeth by non compliant servers.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it&#x27;s 10% of Denmark&#x27;s total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.
Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it&#x27;s actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the thing about the average career in big tech: five years after you leave, almost no one will remember you were there. Most of your old team mates will leave for other other jobs. Your code will get refactored or rewritten. Docs will be superseded, then lost in some CMS migration. Before long, it will be as if you have never worked there.
I know it sounds preposterous, but ask anyone over the age of 55 or 60: except for folks who built their own companies or made truly exceptional contributions to their field, most will say that hobbies, friends, and family mattered a lot more.
So, there is this fundamental contradiction in this article: you can engineer a very neat career, but for most techies, the most useful goal is to make money fast in a way that doesn&#x27;t drain your life energy. And most of the time, this means responding to opportunities, not sticking to your guns. For example, a lifetime IC job may be ultimately worth less than a management job that gets you to VP level in a decade. You don&#x27;t need to dream about being a manager; you just need to be reasonably good at it.</span>

There’s a lot of not so great things happening in the world right now that we often forget to be thankful for the little things.
Or is that just me?
I used to write one line a day of things that I was grateful for. In every day life, I would find something that I am thankful for. It could be as little as the sun came out today after days of rain to big things like I got the promotion I’ve been waiting for today.
Then I stopped.
It was hard to keep up with. I was struggling to find the silver lining in things. I got tired of people telling me it happened for a reason. You’ll see!
With Thanksgiving in the horizon, I want to bring a little bit of that grateful attitude back. I know, I know,…</span>

                              <span>A contradictory title from someone who lives in a country that is among the world&#x27;s largest coffee consumers, and who loves a Swedish fika.
The title, of course, refers to the &quot;Buy Me a Coffee&quot; buttons that you see on every other blog. Today, it&#x27;s often easier to find a donation button than a link to the RSS feed or a contact page.
I tried it myself when launching the Bearming Theme. It lasted for a day; then I removed it. It simply doesn&#x27;t feel right—at least not at the moment.
I don’t think I offer anything that justifies a call to donate money. I write some blog posts and let others use my theme. That’s it!
Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of background and culture. Maybe it has to do with the typically Scandinavian &quot;jantelagen&quot; (Law of Jante). I don&#x27;t know.
I don&#x27;t blame anyone who chooses to use these buttons. Some may see it as a way to put some pressure on themselves to deliver. Some may see it as a way for others to show appreciation.
Personally, I blog almost daily anyway, and I think it&#x27;s nice to know that I don&#x27;t &quot;have to.&quot; And when it comes to appreciation from others, a short email or a guestbook entry feels much more valuable to me.
But hey, if you&#x27;re ever in Sweden and feel like buying me a real cup of coffee, I&#x27;ll gladly accept your fika invitation any day of the week. ☕️</span>

As if that weren&#x27;t special enough, she also drove a long way to see me and brought carnations, oatmeal cookies, and &quot;Bounder&quot;, this little porcelain jackrabbit1 who now lives at the base of my desklamp with the blue penholding crab. A proper menagerie, they are.
E also brought her guitar, so we spent the better part of two hours singing songs we both knew, her strumming the guitar and me playing on my upright. Our shared repertoire is severely limited by my general unculturedness and I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not practicing River more enough for us to record something (it is getting to be that time of year), but it was still one of the most fun afternoons I&#x27;ve h…</span>

Posting this somewhat later than I usually do since we woke up to an Internet outage. It was supposed to be fixed at 1pm today but now they&#x27;re estimating it will be back at some time late afternoon tomorrow1 (Sunday). Sigh.
🌪️ It&#x27;s been a rough week this week. There is a bomb cyclone and atmospheric river going through the West Coast. The changes in atmospheric pressure  triggers the worst migraine episodes for me.
😶‍🌫️ I&#x27;ve been going through the days with the biggest mental fog ever. Half the time I&#x27;m not quite sure what day it is. It&#x27;s absolutely surprising the level of competence I still maintain while at work.

                              <span>Why do I blog? Because I like to write.
That&#x27;s my spontaneous answer.
And it&#x27;s true—but far from the whole truth. It became obvious when I chose to write without blogging during the week.
I felt creatively stifled. As if everything I created was never really complete. A gallery with paintings lacking frames.
For me, blogging is so much more than publishing texts. I like to tinker with the design and format the texts with a &quot;digital mentality.&quot; I like my blogging workflow and everything surrounding it.
I blog because I love blogging.

People lower down the chain are insecure because they could legitimately be let go at any time for any reason.
People higher up the chain are insecure because any loss of face is debilitating. Especially having failings pointed out by someone &quot;below&quot; them.</span>

                              <span>Astonishing. Completely backwards. This article describes how to give feedback to your subordinates, not to your superiors. If your superiors are unable to process no-fluff information, regardless of whether it&#x27;s feedback or updates, they have no business lording over anyone and will sink whatever function they have oversight of. If you find yourself working under such people, don&#x27;t bother giving feedback, start polishing your resume.
The reason you fluff up feedback to your subordinates is because lower down the chain they tend to be insecure and don&#x27;t yet have the experience to distinguish between actionable impartial feedback, and threats to their job security.
The reason you don&#x27;t fluff feedback, or any information for that matter to your superiors, is described in basically every handbook on highly effective communication in organizations.</span>

                              <span>I quit my FAANG job yesterday to join a fully remote company. I took a &gt;50% pay cut but I think it is a 100% life saver. I remember spending 3-4 hours/day commuting and I am just not willing to do that any more. I&#x27;ve cut back on expenses and simplified my life, built up some savings so I can make do with less. My retirement savings will slow down dramatically, but if I don&#x27;t hate my work life then those savings will be less of an all-consuming goal.
Thank you senior leadership for your wisdom, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, find another place to work&quot;. The first good advice I&#x27;ve heard from them in 5 years.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday one of my students asked me, after class was over and she was the last one left in our online classroom, if we would have new classmates next time.
Me: &quot;What do you mean? Like next week?&quot;
Her: &quot;No, like next round, when we do this again.&quot;
She&#x27;d meant after the end of our ten weeks together, at the start of the new quarter. Ahhhh! I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her there wouldn&#x27;t be a next round. I said I didn&#x27;t know, and that I&#x27;d have to ask the school.
After I responded, she raised her hand – which was not necessary at this point, but a testament to her behavior in class. When I called on her, she told me unprompted that she&#x27;d asked because she loves the class and looks forward to the two days at the end of the week because it&#x27;s when we meet.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been thinking back to that wonderful week I had in the summer when I had no social media on my phone. How fulfilled I felt without my phone gnawing at me every 5 seconds. I really want to do that now, in the hopes that it&#x27;ll allow me to focus on my work more, and also allow me to enjoy my non-work hobbies more (like this one!).
The issue now though is that most of my new uni friends are mainly contacted through instagram, and while contacting friends through other means wasn&#x27;t an issue for me last time, this time I&#x27;m still in the process of building these bonds with these people (not that the growing ever ends, but I don&#x27;t want to cut off my only non-in-person access!). At the same time, my stupid monkey brain can&#x27;t help but go to my phone whenever I&#x27;m bored, no matter how much I try to help it.
I&#x27;ve been cutting down on digital inputs in my life in almost every other way. I&#x27;ve taken a habit of pinning my to do lists for assignments right in front of me on my desk, and I carry my notebook and sketchbook (which is more of a junk journal now) with me wherever I go. I just need to cut out that damn reels page!! Screw Instagram for copying TikTok as soon as I deleted it, I had literally no chance.</span>

                              <span>11/24/24 - Update: After some feedback, I&#x27;ve added some calculations to this post as well as a forgotten subscription.
Subscriptions are a necessary evil these days. It seems like everyone wants to you to subscribe to whatever they offer and as much as I try to avoid subscriptions, I still have a huge list of them I pay for each month.
I try to take advantage of annual sales around Black Friday and so I thought now would be a good time to recap what I&#x27;ve subscribed to this past year and see whether or not I found value in the subscription. If anyone else makes a list like this, please let me know, I love unbiased opinions on these sorts of things.
I did not include any trial subscriptions or anything that I paid for less than three months.

                              <span>For a good part of my life, I tried to be religious and failed miserably. During my formative years, church was a social connection as well as a place for religious instruction. During elementary school, my Mom was married to a non-believer, so she didn&#x27;t attend church, but my siblings and I went with a neighbor to a Southern Baptist church on the outskirts near the prison. My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).
In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It …</span>

This is not a professional article, it’s a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn’t the US private sector I’m talking about, it may not match your experiences.
I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.

I&#x27;ve been programming professionally now for 10 years, and it just doesn&#x27;t resonate with my experience. Problems with build systems for external dependencies, package managers, and underfeatured / overcomplicated / buggy third party dependencies have been by far the worse issue in my career, compared to problems with homebrewed systems.
I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, I don&#x27;t doubt that many people have the opposite experience. It just makes me feel a bit alien when I read comments like this.</span>

We think of the family as a group that practices “basic communism”: from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. Any family is thought to be protected by bonds of kinship from the cruel laws of the outside world. Unlike businesses, rarely will a family throw out a sick child or an elderly parent because they are no longer “revenue-generating assets.” More

                              <span>Any successful peace initiative will have to accept that the Ukraine conflict has no single bad guy. We do not recognize Putin’s view of NATO as a beast with encircling claws. At the same time, Russians can be forgiven for thinking that the Western narrative is not quite as defensive as it seems. “The spread of our values makes us safer” declared Tony Blair in Chicago in 1999, justifying NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia. This sets out the ground for forcible regime change when the opportunity offers. The underlying message is that democracy is the peaceful, dictatorship the warlike form of the state, so a war for democracy is necessarily a war for peace. Many Western analysts view the war in Ukraine as a war for regime change in Russia, which is why they cannot contemplate anything less than a Ukrainian victory. More

                              <span>The hysteria over Trump’s election must be tempered by just how awful Biden has been after the entirely predictable, if sinister, decision of the American electorate to return Trump to power. The liberal abreaction to Trump has revealed how thoroughly blind many have been to the vileness of Biden and his obedient circle of advisors and enforcers. If there was a secret Biden waiting until after the election to emerge, it was only a more malicious and baleful version of the Biden we’ve witnessed for the last four years.  More

                              <span>For the past six decades, Indonesia has been an occupying colonial power in West Papua. The United Nations is responsible for this and its atrocious consequences, as John Saltford meticulously details in his account of the 1969 UN-orchestrated handover of West Papua to Indonesia in a so-called Act of Free Choice, which was nothing more than “a ridiculous and overtly manipulated denial of West Papuan rights”. Ever since, overt manipulation of the reality of the West Papuan people has been the order of the day in the international arena. The murderous farce is officially blessed as Indonesia has been a member of the UN Human Rights Council since 2006. More

ICC and the prosecutor are on very solid ground here.
The prosecutor asked opinions from a impartial panel of experts in international law. The panel included people like Theodor Meron (former Legal adviser for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs),  Helene Kennedy, Adrian Fulford.
Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant provided plenty of evidence of the intent. Did they really think that when they talk Hebrew to their audience, rest of the world does not hear them. Case like this would be harder to prosecute without evidence of intent.</span>

                              <span>Why do banks fail? In a new working paper, we study more than 5,000 bank failures in the U.S. from 1865 to the present to understand whether failures are primarily caused by bank runs or by deteriorating solvency. In this first of three posts, we document that failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. Further, we find that problems in failing banks are often the consequence of rapid asset growth in the preceding decade.</span>

Chip named &#x27;Newnew Polar Bear&#x27; under Chinese flag and Chinese company Hainan Xin Xin Yang Shipping Co, Ltd. (aka Torgmoll) with CEO named Yelena V. Maksimova, drags anchor in the seabed cutting cables. Chinese investigation claims storm was the reason, but there was no storm, just normal windy autumn weather. The ship just lowered one anchor and dragged it with engines running long time across the seabed until the anchor broke.
These things happen sometimes, ship anchors sometimes damage cables, but not this often and without serious problems in the ship. Russians are attempting plausible deniability.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.
So when those times have occurred I&#x27;ve (we&#x27;ve more accurately) adopted what I refer to the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; response to just about anything non-trivial.  &quot;Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take.&quot;  Then you&#x27;ll get asked to &quot;ballpark it&quot; because that&#x27;s what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done &quot;ahead of time&quot; and look good.
Now, I&#x27;ve had good managers who totally didn&#x27;t need this strategy, and I loved &#x27;em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m the first author of the manuscript, so I thought I could answer some of the questions and clarify some issues (all details are in the manuscript, but who has the time to read it ;)
Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.
Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery&#x27;s (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.
Many authors and wasted public funding:…</span>

                              <span>People here seem to be underestimating the advantages that Google gets just because of Chrome:
- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You&#x27;ll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn&#x27;t an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn&#x27;t ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.
