                              <span>Has labor demand changed since the COVID-19 pandemic? In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.</span>

                              <span>The conventional wisdom is that Russia doesn’t need any security guarantees, but there will be no movement toward resolving the conflict as long as the Kremlin has no idea of Western plans for tactical and strategic deployments on its sensitive western border over the next five to ten years.  Putin, indeed no Russian leader, can willingly accept a permanently expanding role for the United States and the European NATO countries on a border that has witnessed costly invasions from Sweden, France, and Germany over the past three centuries.  What would be the U.S. reaction to Russian military alliances with Canada and Mexico…or Cuba?

                              <span>As with any narrative of ‘political correctness gone mad’, this specific example provides us with a surreal and topsy-turvy inversion.  It relocates a marginalized group – in this case trans people – in a position of great power and influence, and thereby helps disguise the vulnerability of the group and the social oppression and discrimination it is subject to.   In the US, for instance, trans women are more than four times more likely to be murdered than cisgender women.  Black trans women are seven times more likely to be murdered than the average member of the general population.

Introductions
Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about
yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
David: I started working on
OpenShift (the Red Hat
distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My
first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl
(kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth (RBAC and *Review APIs are ports
from OpenShift), apps (workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others,
but API Machinery is still my favorite :)

                              <span>This pitch worked much better in the 80s and 90s when
A) most investors had a broker not just for advice, but because there was no easy way to trade individually or get live stock quotes until the internet was widespread and matured
B) telephone sales in general were more common then and less likely to be a scam (Stratton Oakmont and other boiler rooms played a large role in shifting public opinion on this)
C) The most desirable prospects (High Net Worth Individuals) were accustomed to dealing with legitimate brokers over the phone and being solicited by brokers from other legitimate firms in such a way
D) The markets were raging in such a way that everyone had FOMO and was dying to hear of a hot new tip
Almost nobody legitimate in the financial advising world acquires customers via cold call pitching anymore. Cold calling is still part of the toolkit for other sales niches (eg, tech sales) but it&#x27;s a tough road with a low success rate.</span>

                              <span>There is a famous paper about the location of company headquarters: they get as close as possible to the residence of company CEOs. If we don&#x27;t consider the CEO&#x27;s influence, I&#x27;m actually curious if the location of company headquarters has to do with the average age of the employees in the Bay Area. As the employees start to have families, they most likely move to the south bay for better or for worse, and I have a hard time imagine that they&#x27;d enjoy commuting via BART or Caltrain for more than an hour every day. And this is probably just me or my circles, a city&#x27;s hustle and bustle becomes a distraction or at least increasing irrelevant as I age. I increasingly enjoy ample parking space, tranquil suburbs, being able to step out and start jogging in woods or huge parks, and certainly not having to deal with the craziness on SF streets. If more people are like me who prefers living outside of the city proper, then I&#x27;d imagine a company will have access to more talent by moving its headquarters to the south of SF.</span>

1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it&#x27;s far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.
2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.
3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.
4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (&quot;#&quot;) which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it&#x27;s important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the &quot;#&quot;. If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).

                              <span>All: can you please not post low-quality angry/snarky junk comments to HN threads? They&#x27;re tedious and have nasty effects.
I realize this story is a cluster of divisive topics but that&#x27;s why HN&#x27;s guidelines say &quot;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.&quot;
If you wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html and taking the intended spirit of the site to heart, we&#x27;d be grateful.</span>

I disagree. 100% they had a better product, but they have absolutely mangled it over the last few updates. Honestly, if I wanted the opinion of randomnumbers45123 on Reddit, I&#x27;d just search Reddit.
Google achieved dominance ~25 years ago by being better than the alternatives, and the other search engines pretty much withered away rapidly. They (Google) are in a very precarious position right now. They will certainly not disappear overnight, but if / when the public becomes aware of something better, the implosion could be spectacular.</span>

                              <span>One of the houses I visited at work today had an absolutely stunning view of the sea. I could have easily stayed there all day.
When I mentioned how amazing the location was, the owner of the house replied, &quot;Yeah, but you don&#x27;t think about it after a while.&quot;
It should be illegal to live like that if you don&#x27;t even appreciate it, I thought as I walked back to my car. I started driving away and caught myself...
But what about me? I&#x27;m basically the same.
I don&#x27;t live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.
How often do I think about it? Hardly ever.
Yet, it&#x27;s something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.
Okay, it&#x27;s never going to be like &quot;the first high&quot; again, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Just a tenth of the first experience is still immensely precious and rewarding.
A tiny bit of awareness is all it takes to start observing and appreciating our surroundings. Let&#x27;s remind ourselves of the beauty of the mundane.</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been feeling upset and frustrated about some of the things happening in my life. I’m screaming into the unknown because I’m not really sure what else to do. The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.
Talking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.
I have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.
Every day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.
I just need to figure out how.

I was having a phone call with my best friend last night. I know he&#x27;s going through a really tough time and has been for a while. I felt anxious and stressed about whether or not I could be a good friend / what he needed. I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.
So why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I&#x27;ve always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me. It&#x27;s always been hard for me to get close to even my best friends. I really abused the shit out of &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t need your help&quot;. Despite that, it felt like it really degenerated during lockdowns, to the point where I&#x27;ve had troub…</span>

                              <span>Mortgage balances, the largest component of U.S. household debt, grew by only $77 billion (0.6 percent) in the second quarter of 2024, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data. This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.</span>

                              <span>Fans of capitalism like to say it is democratic or that it supports democracy. Some have stretched language so far as to literally equate capitalism with democracy, using the terms interchangeably. No matter how many times that is repeated, it is simply not true and never was. Indeed, it is much more accurate to say that capitalism and democracy are opposites. To see why, you have only to look at capitalism as a production system where employees enter into a relationship with employers, where a few people are the boss, and most people simply work doing what they are told to do. That relationship is not democratic; it is autocratic. More

                              <span>Instrument-rated pilot (and engineer) here.
First - congrats on the launch! I think you&#x27;re working on an interesting set of components that will prove useful to GA aircraft technology. Bringing fly-by-wire, and lowering the cost of maintenance/manufacturing are both great efforts.
That being said, my personal view is that stick-and-rudder control is one of the less critical components to improving GA safety. Everything else - flight planning, comms, automation, navigation, weather, inspections, procedures, regs, and most importantly - working in the federal airspace system - are the &quot;hard&quot; parts of flying and where problems tend to occur. It&#x27;s common belief that single-pilot IFR is the most challenging type of flying, because of how much you have to do all at once.
It may sound snobby - but I&#x27;m not super excited about the idea of lowering the barrier to entry for GA on a foundational skill basis. Like the light-sport rating, it encourages more people to be in the (already congested) airspace system who haven&#x27;t really gained all the other skills necessary or experience to be there.
To be clear - I think improving technology and lowering costs &#x3D; good. Lowering early-skill requirements for pilots and pushing more people without all the other skills into federal airspace &#x3D; very bad. In general, I&#x27;d frame this effort more as an effort to raise the bar for system technology, not lower the bar to become a pilot in the first place.</span>

                              <span>I expect this to be bad for everyone except Google if the ruling holds. Why? Mozilla and Apple will lose significant revenue from having Google as the default search engine and Google will no longer have to pay those billions. What&#x27;s more, no one else can pay to be the default either (eg the short-lived Mozilla Bing deal).
So what&#x27;s going to happen? Most users will probably still use Google, nobody is getting paid and Google is saving a bundle.
I get the thinking that you have to prevent lock-in (eg Ticketmaster and venues) but Google didn&#x27;t buy its way into dominance annd maintain their dominance through exclusivity deals. They simply have a better product and I don&#x27;t expect anyone to match them anytime soon (cue the DDG &quot;I switched from Google to DDG 78 years ago&quot; crowd).</span>

                              <span>We face a number of challenges simply letting our paying customers change their search engine:
1. On iOS the list of allowed search engines is simply baked into OS, we have a fiddly extension that hooks outbound calls to /search and redirects them but I wish we didn&#x27;t need to.
2. On Chrome, we use an extension to change the default search engine and enable search auto-complete etc, but Google has a policy that such an extension can do one thing and one thing only, and recently removed our extension on account of that [1]. We rebuilt it to meet their needs but had a lot of back-and-forth because we included &#x27;search by image&#x27; on a context menu item and the first reviewer felt that was a bridge too far. You&#x27;ll note that Chrome provides such a context menu item for Google Image search out of the box.
3. On Chrome for Linux, the default search engine API is not available, so Linux users have to configure it manually through a series of silly steps [2]. This is at least in keeping with most Linux experiences.
There are other issues, but I say all this to highlight how surprisingly difficult it is to change this setting in a practical, consumer friendly way. It is most certainly this difficult by design, that&#x27;s a lot of revenue to protect.

I’m with my wife Bess (https://bessstillman.substack.com/) and my brother Sam, and crying, but it is okay. At the end of Lord of the Rings Gandalf says to the hobbits, &quot;Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.” And that is how I feel now. Ending prematurely hurts, but all things must end, and my time to end is upon me.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been into running a blog or personal site very long, it&#x27;s safe to say you&#x27;ve heard the terms &quot;IndieWeb&quot; or &quot;small web&quot; thrown around. I&#x27;ve only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.
Really, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It&#x27;s like independent music. You&#x27;re writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.
It&#x27;s pretty punk, actually. Running your own corner of the internet is like recording an album in your bedroom and then selling it at the shows you independently worked with bars and venu…</span>

                              <span>Inspired by Lou and Kerri&#x27;s post about video games, I thought I&#x27;d talk a little bit about my seemingly random history of video games I&#x27;ve owned and played in the past.
Disclaimer: I don’t really play a lot of video games, back then and now. There were a few over the years that I enjoyed playing occasionally, but I never really got too obsessed over any of them.
Some of the ones I remember playing on the PC:
Oregon Trail: Probably one of the first PC games I ever played.
Math Blasters: My parents believed that if I were to play “video games,” I might as well learn at the same time. I surprisingly enjoyed this, despite my aversion to math.
Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing: I don’t think this is considered a video game, but this was the story of my childhood. A little bit of fun, with a mixture of…</span>

                              <span>Long after I&#x27;d finished creating the theme for this blog, I still thought the design was spot on (and still do). It&#x27;s the ideal theme in my opinion.
Recently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: &quot;It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It&#x27;s so incredibly boring!&quot;
I&#x27;d never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It&#x27;s true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.
Anyway, that, combined with Lou&#x27;s post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It&#x27;s always exciting and inspiring to try something different.
I plan to use Bear&#x27;s official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I&#x27;m also considering some larger changes as separate &#x27;add-ons&#x27;.
If I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it. I&#x27;m not a professional designer (and have a full-time job), so Bear with me — it might take a while...or never get finished.</span>

 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…</span>

Title: Origin of Anarchism
Date: 1902
Source: Retrieved on 3rd August 2024 from archive.org

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…</span>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…</span>

                              <span>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a rapidly growing ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology, primarily on the Ethereum network. These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.</span>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is neither a great orator, nor did his speech before a joint Congressional session on July 24 have actual worth. It was an expression of his desperation, if not defeat, on all fronts.
This is not new. For years, Netanyahu has served the role of a social media meme. During his United Nations General Assembly speech in September 2012, the Israeli leader displayed a bomb diagram to fan the flames for another Middle East war. More

That, says Nadav Weiman, is driven in large part by the rhetoric constantly fed to them, and in particular, the use of the term ‘Amalek’. It refers to an Old Testament commandment to wipe out all Amalekians for attacking Jews as they left Egypt, and not to spare their children or livestock while destroying everything they owned. More

&gt; I used this project as an opportunity to learn about Rust and FUSE file systems. I also think it&#x27;s hilarious.
&gt; Visitors interested in the code should note that this is 
 an irredeemably messy codebase—it&#x27;s full of hacks, unidiomatic code, and wildly poor design decisions.
&gt; However, visitors should also 
note that that&#x27;s okay. The 
best way to learn something 
new is to try it out for 
yourself—and creating a mess 
is a vital part of that 
process.
I absolutely love this sentiment. Why do this? Because it’s fun. And messy. And sometimes, that’s okay. Not everything needs to be a product… sometimes it’s enough to do something because you can… or want to… or because $RANDOM reason. I’m very grateful to the author and whoever decided to submit it today.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Everyone knew there were introverts and extroverts, homebodies and socialites, but it had never really mattered. The two groups complemented each other and managed to peacefully cohabit.
What a very extroverted perspective. &quot;Everything was fine when the world was structured around an extroverted lifestyle. Then the pandemic hit and everything was miserable for a bit, but what&#x27;s even worse is that those darn introverts aren&#x27;t happy resuming their natural place in society!&quot;
The pandemic gave us a taste of what life could be like if the world were structured around our preferred way of existing instead of yours. It turns out we liked it, and now that we&#x27;ve had that taste we&#x27;re not comfortable resuming the old status quo where we just tag along for the ride in an extroverted world.
It boggles my mind that someone can write an article like this and not realize that what they&#x27;re saying is they wish a group of people would go back to being an underclass.</span>

I think it&#x27;s good that the status quo got mixed up a bit. The introverts don&#x27;t have to defend themselves or feel like outsiders quite so much.
This article aligns stay-at-home-ness with &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;a fettered life,&quot; &quot;hardly worth living&quot; and says &quot;retreating ... is an ultimately selfish choice.&quot; I believe that&#x27;s a bit of a poor take. Plenty of people live rich, productive, fulfilling and engaged lives that don&#x27;t especially involve a lot of interactions with other people.
This author is clearly someone whose habits were impinged by the changes brought on by the pandemic (&quot;... naturally outgoing people – this writer included – have found it that bit harder to get their friends out of the house.&quot;), but is that the end of the world?
It almost feels like the author is eager to get back to what they are comfortable with, at the expense of (by their numbers) 1/3 of other people&#x27;s lifestyles. It&#x27;s almost like they are the ones afraid of this change — like they are the selfish ones.
But I don&#x27;t really go for the whole us-vs-them approach at all. It has been a great (if forced) learning experience. Some people got to discover happiness they didn&#x27;t know before. Other people felt the loss of something they took for granted. Perhaps we should share these lessons with each other and bring some balance and increased awareness, rather than pointing fingers and taking sides.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a running theme in here of programming problems LLMs solve where it&#x27;s actually not that important that the LLM is perfectly correct. I&#x27;ve been using GPT4 for the past couple months to comprehend Linux kernel code; it&#x27;s spooky good at it.
I&#x27;m a C programmer, so I can with some effort gradually work my way through random Linux kernel things. But what I can do now instead is take a random function, ask GPT4 what it does and what subsystem it belongs to, and then ask GPT4 to write me a dummy C program that exercises that subsystem (I&#x27;ve taken to asking it to rewrite kernel code in Python, just because it&#x27;s more concise and easy to read).
I don&#x27;t worry at all about GPT4 hallucinating stuff (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing that all the time!), because I&#x27;m just using its output as Cliff&#x27;s Notes for the actual kernel code; GPT4 isn&#x27;t the &quot;source of truth&quot; in this situation.</span>

                              <span>In my first Blaugust post, I insinuated that I had a plan on how I’m going to tackle this month’s blogging challenge.
I&#x27;ll make a plan (of some sort) of how I&#x27;m going to tackle this at some point.
The truth is, my plan going into this is to not have a plan.
I joined the IndieWeb blogging community at the very tail end of March. In April, I joined a daily photo challenge hosted by Micro.blog. It was my very first challenge and had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed posting a photo a day alongside a community based on a specific prompt. I felt that sort of camraderie feeling amongst a blogging community I haven’t felt in a very long time.
That one was easy. I didn’t stress out about it because photos tend to come easier to me than words. I had a collection of photos I could dig into to meet t…</span>

                              <span>I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.
But there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can&#x27;t help but hire you. Can&#x27;t help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.
This is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.
What happened to being that intense &#x27;Steve Job&#x27; type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.
It goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don&#x27;t just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.</span>

                              <span>The summer term is over! I&#x27;m back in my hometown, bothering my dogs and following my grandmother around the house like a little kid. I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to settle for almost there. I&#x27;ll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.
School aside, there&#x27;s nothing much to write about today. The sky&#x27;s been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good. Thank God for bread.
I&#x27;m starting and abandoning so many new posts. I couldn&#x27;t settle on any of them, so I decided to do this one instead. Hope you had some good bread in your life today!</span>

Oh okay! I didn&#x27;t think about it that way! I&#x27;m so silly 🤪
For real though, one of the things about getting older is caring less about what people think. I used to think my dad looked so lame wearing 10 year old, $7 jeans from Walmart, generic black tennis shoes and a plain solid color tee shirt all the time like he&#x27;s some kinda Seinfeld character. Meanwhile I was straightening my blonde emo-ver hair, wearing skin tight skinny jeans with a pink studded belt from Spencer&#x27;s and walking around in loud, multicolor, just... massive tongued skating shoes.
These days, half the time I&#x27;m at work anyway so I&#x27;m wearing a long-sleev…</span>

                              <span>Astonishingly, It took a long time for revision control to become widespread.
Around 1991 when Cygnus had 6-7 employees and was based in the apartment complex where I lived, none of the GNU codebase was hosted in any sort of revision control.  Everything was FTPed around as obscurely named tarballs.  We had gathered something like 27 different forks of gdb floating around the net, for example.  This was back when forking was generally considered a tragedy, something I managed to change five or six years later).
Rich Pixley came and said “all of our code should be in revision control, and I want to use this newfangled thing called CVS.”  Michael was OK with it but John and I were steadfastly opposed.  We agreed to an experiment, grudgingly, subject to a whole whiteboard of absurd conditions (“must be transparently integrated into emacs so we don’t have to know it’s there).
Pixley agreed to all of that and then ignored all of it completely.  It was immediately such a win that everybody adopted it without complaint, including us two obstreperous a-holes.
A few years later a preventable crisis was how revision control first became client-server.</span>

                              <span>When I started at my first company, they had a very complex VB application running on dozens of customers around the country, each having some particular needs of course.
There was a LOT of global variables (seemingly random 4 uppercase letters) controlling everything.
At some point, the application had some bugs which were not appearing when the application was run in debug mode in Visual Studio. The solution was obvious: installing Visual Studio for each customer on site and teaching the users to run the app in debug mode from Visual Studio. I don&#x27;t know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done.
What happened next was even worse.
There was no version control of course, the code being available on a shared disk on the local network of the company with the code copied over in multiple folders each having its own version, with no particular logic to it either, V1, V2, V2.3, V2a, V2_customer_name, V2_customer_name_fix, ...
After that, when there was a problem for a customer, the programmer went there to debug and modified the code on site. If the bug/problem was impacting other customers, we had to dispatch some guys for each customer to go copy/edit the code for all of them. But if the problem was minor, it was just modified there, and probably saved on the shared folder in some new folder.
What happened next was to be expected: there was no consensus on what was the final version, each customer having slightly different versions, with some still having bugs fixed years before for others.</span>

                              <span>Probably some of the worst code I ever worked on was a 12k+ line single file Perl script for dealing with Human Genome Project data, at Bristol-Myers Squibb, in the late 1990s.
The primary author of it didn&#x27;t know about arrays. I&#x27;m not sure if he didn&#x27;t know about them being something that had already been invented, or whether he just didn&#x27;t know Perl supported them, but either way, he reimplemented them himself on top of scalars (strings), using $foo and $foo_offsets. For example, $foo might be &quot;romemcintoshgranny smithdelicious&quot; and $foo_offsets &#x3D; &quot;000004012024&quot;, where he assumes the offsets are 3 digits each. And then he loops through slices (how does he know about slices, but not arrays?) of $foo_offsets to get the locations for $foo.
By the time I was done refactoring that 12k+ was down to about 200 ... and it still passed all the tests and ran analyses identically.</span>

The excuse for not taking responsibility is that there are &quot;language standards&quot; saying that these bugs should be blamed on millions of programmers writing code that bumps into &quot;undefined behavior&quot;
But that&#x27;s not an excuse for having a bug; it&#x27;s the exact evidence that it&#x27;s not a bug at all. Calling the compiler buggy for not doing what you want when you commit Undefined Behavior is like calling dd buggy for destroying your data when you call it with the wrong arguments.</span>

                              <span>My worst codebase story:
In my first real job, I worked for a company that maintained a large legacy product programmed in a combination of COBOL and Java.
In order to work on the Java side of the product, you checked out individual files from source control to work on, which &#x27;locked&#x27; the files and prevented other developers from checking out the same files. This functionality was not part of our actual source control system, but was instead accomplished with a series of csh shell scripts you could run after ssh&#x27;ing into our development server.
Each of our customers had a &#x27;master&#x27; jar file that represented the actual final compiled product (a jar file is really a zip file archive, which bundles together the resulting compiled java class files).
Once you had finished implementing your code changes, you ran another set of scripts which found the master jar file for each customer, unzips it, copies the compiled files from your local machine into it, and zips it back up again. Finally the source control lock is released.
This means, effectively, that the codebase was never compiled as a whole at any point in the process, instead, we just manually patched the jar file over time with individually compiled class files.
Over the years, small errors in the process allowed a huge amount of inconsistencies to creep into the codebase. Race conditions would allow two developers to lock the same file at once, or a developer would change a class that was a dependency of some other code that somebody else was changing. Sometimes code changes would make it into some of the customer jar files, but not others. Nobody knew why.
It took a small team two years to migrate the entire codebase to git with proper CI, and a huge chunk of that time was reproducing a version of the codebase that actually compiled properly as a whole. After the project was finished, I resigned.</span>

                              <span>Today, I realized that the past three days share something important and beautiful: community.
Today, the pride parade took place here in Stockholm. I met up with my mom, sister, her husband, and their kids, who had come to the city for the occasion. It was wonderful sharing the event with them.
Yesterday, I decided to return to Mastodon. I missed the community and created a new account (birming@social.lol). Thank you all for the warm welcome. You&#x27;re amazing!
The day before yesterday, I decided to continue this blog. Since then, I&#x27;ve received wonderful feedback from you readers. It&#x27;s made me happy, grateful, and motivated. Thank you all!
Three days, three different experiences, but one common thread: community. It&#x27;s easy to overlook this invaluable aspect of life. However, when it&#x27;s absent, we truly understand its significance.
So, dear friends, thank you for being part of my life.</span>

The chilly morning winter air
Being able to admire beautiful sunrise and sunsets
The colourful sound of bird calls
The feeling of serenity when I have a glass of tea in the early hours of the morning
The peace I feel whenever I sit down to write a post
Moments spent with loved ones
Sleeping in on the weekends
Tasty food
You, for reading this post!
I would love to hear what your &quot;little things&quot; are! Leave a message in my guest book or shoot me a message on the Blaugust discord.

                              <span>I&#x27;m Valentine. As you&#x27;ve probably already guessed, that is not my real name. I like my (semi-)anonymity. I may be spilling my guts on here, but I&#x27;d like to do it under the cover of a good old pseudonym.
Like a lot of people, I&#x27;ve been using different names online for years. Obviously not to commit crimes, but to make it less likely I become a victim of one. Also, I just like it. Names fascinate me: they make up such a big part of our first impressions. I&#x27;ve tried feminine names and not-so-feminine ones. I&#x27;ve never tried a really masculine name, though—I&#x27;ve always loved being a woman, online and offline, even if it comes with many inconveniences of varying sizes.
I took Valentine from the Måneskin song of the same name. But if that&#x27;s too somber for you, there&#x27;s also the Laufey song, which i…</span>

Here we are a day later, and I still don’t quite have the words for it. I always fall back to a post I’ve written of not wanting to talk about myself as an explanation. Either way, I’ve come to realize that I never did do a proper introduction on this blog, outside of my About me page. In my defense, I think what I have written on there is enough to kind of get a gist for who I am.
But since I’m writing a post anyways, I figured I’d say something else that doesn’t completely repeat everything written on there.
Online, I typically go by JC(Probably), but most people in real life call me Jedda. You can tell a lot about how people know me, and from what moment in …</span>

                              <span>Being in my early 20s, there should be no surprise that I have grown up with and have extensively used social media platforms to socialise, communicate, and share ideas with other people. It is no secret that these platforms can and have caused harm to their user&#x27;s mental health (me included!), but even knowing this I&#x27;ve sat on my hands for years before actually taking action to remedy this situation.
However, as a lot of you know, it&#x27;s not easy to just drop social media cold turkey. In my opinion, I think there are a few main reasons why this is the case, and I will attempt to argue against each one in this post.
1. Social media is addictive

                              <span>The findings of the original study were called into question by a larger 2018 study[0]. The original study had 90 students. Some folks did a study with 900 people. They found the same correlation that the original study did. But when they controlled for household income, they found most of the correlation disappeared.
The obvious conclusion is that household income is a predictor of both:
- inability to delay gratification, and
- higher academic achievement
This makes sense when you consider that someone growing up in a poor household may have both:
- less reliable/continuous/predictable access to material things, meaning they would rationally seize immediate opportunities rather than taking the risk of a larger future opportunity, and
- less academic support
Now, this new study (OP) goes even further, finding that the correlation itself is weak.

Whenever we interacted with them it would be a small chit-chat, exchange small updates (how&#x27;s your son doing, is he married yet?) and then finally do the actual purchase.
It was to an extent that the carpenter would come by and just hand over a big dining table just because he thought our house deserved/needed it. He wouldn&#x27;t ask for immediate payment either and also in instalments. Some other times he would come by and borrow some money.
All of that is now gone. Every single interaction I have now with vendors is 100% transactional. I don&#x27;t even know their names nor they mine.
It means that I&#x27;m now connected only with my immediate family, that&#x27;s it. It also means that the generation now growing up know only transactional way of interaction with non family/friends. I guess these things eventually add up to the loss of community.</span>

                              <span>Well, yes, we&#x27;ve doubled down on mediating social interactions through economic relationships. Most of the interactions adults have in their lives are with or in the framing of economic relations. Homes, are being invaded with tablets and mobile devices which bring along with them framing interactions as economic relations through ad and consumer frames. Workplaces are inherently settings of economic relations, and third places outside of the consumer setting are becoming extinct because they are non-monetizable.
This last category, non-consumer third places are formerly the domain of kid-friendly community-building activities. When we talk about creating more of these and the response is, &quot;they aren&#x27;t economically viable,&quot; it&#x27;s exactly the kind of economic calculus framing that I&#x27;m talking about.</span>

Notes: Author’s note: a straight-through read would make 200+ minutes. Please take your time with such a hefty work. Breaks are encouraged. If you are Black, trans/queer, and operating in good faith, feel free to highlight passages you would like to learn more about. Medium allows authors to interact with their readers. I might be able to provide clarification if I have spoons.

 The ghost of Turgenev crying 
 “Enough!” 
 Is in my ears 
 My activities are glorious 
 While several seasons 
 Fighting disease 
 Living closely with personal existential uncertainty 
 My body is marked 
 There is a thin line 
 Across my left eyelid 
 A scar from where it was removed 
 I am tired of this 
 There is a book 
 Being written 
 The first section poems like this 
 I wonder if it’s my last 
 I don’t know

 All things are possible 
 So say Shestov and Fondane 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 Including the impossibility 
 Of my writing another book after this 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 What is most possible though 
 For all life 
 It seems is i…</span>

It Doesn’t Have to Be This Way, You Know
 There is a beauty that creeps in under the plastic blinds, covering the window, in the form of sunlight. A beauty that seems an attempt by the world outside to draw some contrast to the words I write here, and that you will read later on. That for all the expression of pain, and dissatisfaction, and desire for more, there is still beauty to be found here, bouncing around the walls of this mold infested apartment.

A Few Words From the Distro
 Riding freight is a core skill for anti-work, anti-school, individualist anarchists, lifestylists, nomads, oogles, crust punk dirty kids, and travelers. 
 Hate your job? Quit and go train hopping! 
 Sick of school? Drop out and go train hopping! 
 Feeling suicidal with no fun and excitement in your life? 
 Try something new, open a new chapter and go train hopping! 
 But train hopping is very dangerous! You SERIOUSLY could die. 
 But you could also die in a car wreck on the way to work, or die from getting shot to death by a mass shooter.

PREFACE
 Welcome to the collective book on collective process! Over the course of the twenty or so years that AK Press has been publishing and distributing anarchist and radical literature, we&#x27;ve gotten a lot of requests for good, short overviews of topics that are of interest to the folks in our communities: anarchism, worker&#x27;s rights, solidarity economics, and countless other things. We do our best to seek out books to publish or distribute that meet our readers’ needs, but it can take a while to find exactly the right author or book.

 The formation of Buddhist socialism in Japan made a belated start and its influence was little compared with that of Christian socialism in Europe, or even with the revolutionary movement (1851-1864) which occurred in the period of “idle peace” started by Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全) in China. The reason for the belated start seems to be indirectly concerned with national isolationism and the slow development of capitalism in Japan. The Communist Manifesto was published 20 years before the Meiji Restoration and the first volume of Das Kapital was issued a year before the Meiji Restoration. Directly…</span>

Title: Hamas, anarchists in the West and Palestine solidarity
Subtitle: An analysis

Notes: Anonymous author from Stoking the Embers Collective

 In the West, it is practically impossible to speak publicly about Hamas in any way that isn&#x27;t an outright and total condemnation. Behind such remarkable limitation of the spectrum of public debate lies the idea that Hamas represents an &quot;evil&quot; so deep that it lacks any complexity. In parliaments, universities and newspapers, Hamas is never discussed, simply because -- it is assumed -- there is nothing to discuss.

                              <span>a social media channel is one thing, but it has multiple sub-things inside
look at youtube
there&#x27;s the side where someone is always selling something
there&#x27;s the side where a grandma is sharing her recipe
there&#x27;s the side where someone just posted a video compilation of their dead love one
there&#x27;s the side where someone is laughing with their friends
earlier this year, i was complaining that my feed was full of people selling me something
but your social media feed doesn&#x27;t operate in a vacuum. it shows you more of what you look for
i wanted to sell something, so i was looking for people to teach me to sell something, so i was only being recommended videos of people teaching me to sell something
i don&#x27;t like that side of the internet
so i left it
you can leave the side you&#x27;re on and join another
or leave altogether</span>

                              <span>Why write?
I have a ritual. Every time I set out to do something new, be it a new habit, a new course, or a new adventure in life, I ask myself, why? This exercise in setting a purpose is essential because it stays as a reminder of your initial vision about what you set out to do. So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.
This isn&#x27;t just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world. There was even a time when I wanted to try to write a self help book, to understand the world and life in general, more effectively. I have always been enamoured by great ideas. For it is these great ideas, passed down from generation to generation, which have survived the test of…</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, I wrote that I had decided to end this blog. When I woke up this morning, I immediately realized that it was the wrong decision.
Crazy? Maybe.
But that’s how it sometimes is. You can’t always reason your way to the right decision. At least, I can’t. I’d been pondering this for weeks...
It was only when the idea became a reality that I realized it was a bad one. I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.
And when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision. Weeks of theoretical pondering didn’t help at all, while taking concrete action gave me an answer in a few hours.
Detours can be shortcuts, at least sometimes and for me. Sorry for the confusion — and welcome to my world. I hope you have the patience to stick around...</span>
