In particular, Israel has targeted Palestinian educational institutions. In late April, UN experts concluded, “with more than 80% of schools in Gaza damaged or destroyed, it may be reasonable to ask if there is an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system, an action known as ‘scholasticide’.”1 The aim of this settler-colonial project is to eradicate the physical, intellectual, and political reproduction of the Palestinian people.

 Most of what comes out in the text “Addicted to Losing” is not new. Black anarchists and anti-authoritarians have been critiquing black non-profits, Black academics, Black activists and black authoritarians for years before the 2020 uprising. Black anarchists who have been active PRIOR to 2020 have been deeply aware of these critiques, mainly based on their experiences.

 For most of the 20th century, all mainstream political parties in Western Europe coalesced around the idea that, ultimately, the state should be the chief provider of social welfare and instrument of social reform.

This has culminated in attacks on the direct provision of welfare by the state in…</span>

                              <span>My personal experience with story points is that the number never really mattered, but the process of the team discussing how to rate the complexity of a task was very useful. In terms of having utility of estimating how long something will take, I personally have never been able to translate story points into a reliable indicator for that for many reasons (e.g team changing, domain changing, variability in operational load outside of development work).
Overall I tend to avoid using story points, but on the few teams I worked on who really wanted to use it, I always framed it around building shared understanding rather than a metric that is actually useful for estimating work.</span>

                              <span>I think teaching is one of the few roles that can&#x27;t be replaced by AI. If you&#x27;re a self-motivated learner, eager to gain new skills, then AI is perfect for you. Having a virtual Feynman coach you through a Physics course is perfect.
Most learners, the world over, are not self-motivated. The pandemic showed us exactly what children would prefer to do, when they don&#x27;t have a physical teacher standing over them, which is bugger all. We send kids to school, in the hope they get some education, but the reality is that we use schools for free childcare while we work. If parents have to additionally monitor their child&#x27;s learning, it breaks down pretty quickly.
I see AI being more of a teaching assistant, rather than a replacement for teachers. Having been in the education game for over twenty five years, I know the difference in impact when comparing virtual learning to in-person training.</span>

                              <span>The author seems very anxious because Rust is getting traction and they don&#x27;t like Rust. They&#x27;re afraid that one day Rust will become a &quot;monoculture&quot; and everything will be written in it.
I like Rust, but I consider this very, very unlikely.
Rust has actually brought more choice to the programming language scenario. If we&#x27;re talking about monoculture, let&#x27;s talk about C/C++. For decades this was the only viable option for systems programming. All new languages were focusing on a higher lever. Languages for lower level stuff were rare. There was D, but it never got enough traction.
Then Rust appeared and there is finally an alternative. And not only that, I because of that, other language designers decided to create new systems languages, and now we have Zig, and Odin, and Vale, etc.
So if anything, Rust is helping in breaking the monoculture, not creating it. C and C++ are not going away, but now we have alternatives.
And I think it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that even if you don&#x27;t like a language, if you see a bunch of software being written in such language, it&#x27;s because the language is useful. I don&#x27;t like C++ but I admit it&#x27;s damn useful! People are writing interesting software in Rust because they find it useful.</span>

What isn’t clear, in retrospect or otherwise, is why companies/apps/services need to keep learning this lesson. The user outcry was utterly predictable from even before the first web article was out. The fact that no one with decision power at Mozilla saw it coming is worrying: either they have zero understanding of people’s concerns for privacy or they don’t care. Neither is good.</span>

                              <span>I awhile back I used to do work with a major DARPA contractor. If you&#x27;re familiar with security clearance for these roles, you know that at the higher levels of clearance you eventually need to take a polygraph exam.
I was never interested in going the clearance route, but got into a conversation with a grizzled industry vet that seemed like a character torn from a hard-boiled detective novel.
At the time I had recently learned that polygraph exams were &quot;fake&quot; and when the topic of the exam came up I was quick to point this out. His comment surprised me, and, in a sense, demonstrated to me that saying a polygraph is &quot;fake&quot; is akin to saying WWE wrestling is &quot;fake&quot;. Of course it is, but that is a misunderstanding that what you&#x27;re watching is a real performance.
He said the polygraph itself is just a tool for the interviewer. The real value was in someone who knew how to use the machine to convince the subject that they knew the truth. He continue that in his time he knew some mighty good interviewers who could easily extract anything they needed from you.
My father did go the clearance route, and when I asked him about the polygraph he told me he confessed things to the interviewers he would never have told my mother. &quot;Fake&quot; or &quot;real&quot; the polygraph does work in this sense.</span>

___________

Yesterday, when I woke up to go for work. I always take a shower &amp; change cloths.
I was half sleep ironing my pant &amp; shirt while yawning . Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.
The bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)

Then I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .
My half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.
My grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?
I told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.
I cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).
I was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.
I felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth. I even shudder just thinking about this event.

                              <span>I had planned to write a post about which text editor I use and why. Another idea was to write about why my next phone might be a Pixel instead of an iPhone. But it feels so incredibly boring to write about.
I don&#x27;t know what it is, but lately these things feel completely pointless to write about. I&#x27;m a tech geek, so it&#x27;s natural for these ideas to come up, but writing serves a different purpose. At least for me.
Am I saying that writing about technology is &quot;bad&quot;? No, of course not. I read blogs like MacRumors and 9to5Google every day with great interest (I used to run similar blogs myself). But that&#x27;s not what I want to write about, at least not right now.
Now I like writing mainly for the therapeutic, almost meditative effect it has on me. I write every day, and I find it very rewarding on a personal level.
These thoughts also lead me to a topic I&#x27;ve been writing about several times now: my ambivalence toward writing in English. I&#x27;m writing this text in Swedish because it&#x27;s too hard and time-consuming to do it in English (I&#x27;ve tried many times) and then using DeepL to translate it.
Why bother with all of that? Well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m asking myself.
If I&#x27;m writing mainly for personal gain, why not just in Swedish? The only thing I can think of is because of the increased attention, which honestly feels like an idiotic argument.
Ok, this was not a text I had planned. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t even post it, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.
These are my thoughts here and now, unedited.</span>

                              <span>This post is inspired by Misha’s post a life lived diligently.
I started playing the piano when I was five. My first dream was to be a concert pianist like Lang Lang. I was drawn to the glitz and glamor of playing in cavernous concert halls to people in suits sitting on red velvet chairs. I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.
For a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around. I thought it a nice compromise between my childhood fantasies and reality.
Mom pulled the plug on my private lessons when I was seventeen, after …</span>

i started doing a lot of new things recently.
getting back into kpop
using actives in my skincare routine to curb my adult acne
mat pilates at home (i’ve been trying to do them daily, but it’s hard. some days just feel harder than others)
trying to lose weight healthily (a point proven difficult by my bulimia that’s graduated to restrictive eating (i barely have any full meals))
watching new kdrama to fill up my empty days

In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.</span>

                              <span>In 1979, I made the first of what would turn out to be decades of periodic visits to Israel and the West Bank. I traveled there for the New York alternative publication The Village Voice to investigate Israel’s growing settler movement, Gush Emunim (or the Bloc of the Faithful). The English-language Israeli newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, then reported that settlers from Kiryat Arba, a Jewish West Bank outpost, had murdered two Palestinian teenagers from the village of Halhoul. There, in one of the earliest West Bank settlements established by Gush Emunim, a distant cousin of my husband had two acquaintances. Under cover of being a Jew in search of enlightenment, I spent several days and nights with them. More

Title: What is the Proletariat?
Date: 2024/05/10
Source: Retrieved on 2024-07-16 from 

 In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Manifesto of the Communist Party. It famously ends by declaring, “let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. Proletarians have nothing to lose in it but their chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries unite!” (Marx and Engels 1996, 30). The word proletariat continues to be used by socialists and communists today. This does not mean that the word is widely understood. Some people use it as a meaningless adjective whereby their ideas, attitudes, and activities are proletarian. Those of people they dislike are bourgeois. Others equate the proletaria…</span>

Title: Train To Nowhere
Subtitle: Call for a week of world wide action and solidarity against the North Bothnia Line, August 11th to 17th, 2024!

1. THE NORTH BOTHNIA LINE
Why aiming at this beast?
 This is a call to action against the North Bothnia Line, a railway just beginning to be built along the coast of Swedish-occupied Sápmi. This project is a continuation of several hundred years of brutal colonization of the peoples and lands in Sápmi. Extractive industries are thriving on the increased demand for raw materials following the so-called “green transition”. This makes them continually stress the importance and urgency of the train line. So do the Swedish State and the European Union.

 Operation ‘Scripta Manent’ is one repressive operation among the many that have already occurred, and continue to occur, against comrades who dare to oppose the Italian State. The pretext here was of trying to find those who have taken part in Informal Anarchist Federation attacks since 2005, but it is also an attempt to destroy all insurrectional conflict in Italy and to cut off any solidarit…</span>

 We’d like to respond with our thoughts to a text “Mise en Commun” (Putting in Common) that has been circulated critiquing insurrectionary projects and perspectives in Montreal. We appreciate that the authors of Mise en Common want to elaborate similarities and clarify differences, and move past bad faith. We’re taking this as an occasion to respond and to clarify ideas that we’ve been reflecting on for a few years now. We’ll try to use points of difference with Mise en Commun as an opportunity to delve further into ideas and how they inform practices, rather than…</span>

 A 2021 study found that 56% of young people across ten countries believed “humanity is doomed.” The researchers rightly warned against narratives of “individualizing ‘the problem’ of climate anxiety, with suggestions that the best response is for the individual to ‘take action.’” However, they followed with the equally misguided suggestion that “such action needs to be particularly taken by those in power.”[1] Those of us influenced by Frankfurt School theorist Herbert Marcuse’s analysis consider…</span>

Abstract:
 The article presents a first overview of the emergence and early development of anarchism in the Republic of Cyprus, utilising archival material. It contextualises Cypriot anarchism within the broader wave of political ideas making their appearance after the island’s de-facto partition in 1974, tracing the formation of the first anarchist groups and the circulation of early Cypriot anarchist publications. It moves on to briefly discuss three key historical moments of anarchist political expression, followed by an examination of early Cypri…</span>

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursive signifiers, through which the mediation of a fixed meaning is structured and social reality is experienced. This research…</span>

                              <span>I worked at a PBM back in the late-90s/early-2000s. It was where I was introduced to the value of customer data and the strange world of lawyers, all in a single corporate meeting:
- The company is launching a new service. We already sell customer drug-prescription data to drug companies, and the drug companies analyze this data to understand where/when/why/to-whom their drugs are being prescribed. Now we&#x27;re going to help the drug companies advise doctors on where/when/why/to-whom they prescribe drugs.
- Sounds great. Where do we come in?
- The new service will act as a middleman, processing payments from drug companies to doctors.
- So, a service to manage kickbacks?
[Meeting room full of suits goes silent.]
- The payments aren&#x27;t &quot;kickbacks&quot;. They&#x27;re &quot;rebates&quot;.
- Is there a difference?
- Absolutely. [silence]
- So...what&#x27;s the difference?
- Please be sure to only use the term &quot;rebate&quot; in all communications, especially email. Never use the term &quot;kickback&quot;.
And that was pretty much it. The company processed prescriptions for pharmacies, then sold that data to drug companies, who in turn used that data to provide kickbacks to doctors for pushing their drugs over a competitor. And it was all legal, thanks to the lawyers and their select word usage. Oh, and I think we weren&#x27;t supposed to use the term &quot;middleman&quot;, either.</span>

https://github.com/ROCm/HIP
Don&#x27;t believe me? Include this at the top of your CUDA code, build with hipcc, and see what happens:

It&#x27;s incomplete because I&#x27;m lazy but you can see most things are just a single #ifdef away in the implementation.</span>

                              <span>A lot of people think AMD should support these translation layers but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea. CUDA is not designed to be vendor agnostic and Nvidia can make things arbitrarily difficult both technically and legally. For example I think it would be against the license agreement of cuDNN or cuBLAS to run them on this. So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.
Chasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool&#x27;s errand. The important users of CUDA are open source. AMD can implement support directly in the upstream projects like pytorch or llama.cpp. And once support is there it can be maintained by the community.</span>

                              <span>&gt; The scare quotes here are uncalled for: it is privacy-preserving.
It is strictly less privacy-preserving than not implementing this &quot;feature&quot; that has zero benefit to the user running the browser. At the very least it pings yet another third party, most likely it effectively leaks much more.
&gt; The best objection to these proposals isn&#x27;t privacy, it&#x27;s that a browser vendor is lifting a finger for advertisers. I guess the fundamental question there is if we prefer to outright shut down online advertising, or give it the tools it needs to be less bad. Opinions differ, but all major browser vendors are in the latter category.
That is a very very generous assumption of the browser makers&#x27; goals. Particularily when one of them IS an online advertising company and another one is almost exclusively funded by said advertising company. They do not deserve the benefit of the doubt.</span>

The schematic capture elements to connect up large blocks of HDL with a ton of I/O going everywhere are one of the few applications of visual programming that I like. Once you get past defining the block behaviors in HDL, instantiation can become tedious and error-prone in text, since the tools all kinda suck with very little hinting or argument checking, and the modules can and regularly do have dozens of I/O arguments. Instead, it&#x27;s often very easy to map the module inputs to schematic-level wires, particularly in situations where large buses can be combined into single fat lines, I/O types can be visually distinguished, etc. IDE keyboard shortcuts also make these signals easy to follow and trace as they pass through hierarch…</span>

                              <span>Today is Monday. I went into the office today, the second of the six day minimum I need to work from the office each month. Since it doesn&#x27;t matter how I choose to spread out these six days, I&#x27;ve decided that it makes the most financial sense for me to get these days knocked out all at once, to save money on subway fare. (The New York subway system charges $2.90 per ride up to a maximum of $34 a week.) And this week makes the most sense for me to come in because I have it &quot;off&quot; from teaching. (Off in quotations because while I&#x27;m not teaching group classes I still have to teach private lessons.)
Nobody comes into the office on Mondays. This particular Monday I also do not have a whole lot to do so I&#x27;ve been binge reading Henrik Karlsson&#x27;s Substack Escaping Flatland. One of the benefits of g…</span>

                              <span>I consider myself a pretty fast reader. I typically get through a book way before it needs to be returned back on Libby1. I get 21 days to finish a book (although my friends have reported 14 days), and that is usually plenty of time. With that said, I’ve never stressed about finishing a book in time.
Until now.
It’s taking me forever to finish A Court of Silver Flames by Sarah J. Maas. It’s not that it’s a terrible book but I haven’t been finding enough energy to read lately. I even switched to listening on Spotify Premium, and I’m still not done.
Anyways.
The return due date has come and gone, but I’m still not done with the book. For those who are familiar with the ACOTAR series, it’s pretty popular right now so the wait time is pretty long. I was on hold for several months for each book…</span>

                              <span>it was hard to write anything at all on the cruise ship last may. i&#x27;d spend so much of the day walking that by night time my feet were fast asleep before i was. i also generally found that there was so little for me to say. i could only describe X, Y, and Z as “so cool” &amp;  “so interesting” so many times before it got dull. so i’ll say it just once here! each stop was, in fact, so cool and so interesting. i do love good food, old architecture, and scenic views – europe has these aplenty. i just wish i spent more time birdwatching. (but i knew that that would be particularly difficult to do on such a tight schedule).
honestly, before my trip, i was 100% convinced i’d hate being on the ocean for such long stretches of time. and this is still partially true now that it&#x27;s over. i’m prone to motion sickness and i’m afraid of a slow death. i ended up partially bedridden for three days, so i was right to worry about the former. i couldn’t eat anything but apples, and i threw up everytime i moved from my bed. it sucked, but at least i&#x27;m not dead.
when i recovered, i discovered that it was ironically grounding to stroll the topmost deck and see nothing but blue and horizon. and that it was especially beautiful at night, even if you couldn&#x27;t really see the stars at all. instead, i’d watch the water long enough for it to look like a fingerprint. then, even longer to find the unicorns in the sea foam. i found myself returning to the same thought each time: in the grand scheme of all things, i am fortunately very small. i will never run out of earth to explore. nothing is never really just nothing, but nothing feels as good as finally being home too.</span>

the brief answer would be that i live for other people. 

long one from here: when the future feels bleak, i keep going because i imagine someone could maybe benefit from my sticking it out at some point. 

ignoring the fact that i sound like a walking savior complex — it&#x27;s more like, there are too many moving parts to write off. 

no matter how average or ordinary you feel, nobody else is going to know what you know the way you know it. nobody is going to do the same things you do, whether you achieve your goals or not. that you spend time reflecting on your place in the world at all means you&#x27;re probably doing your best at living, and chances are you&#x27;re gonna move somebody somewhe…</span>

                              <span>While much remains unknown about the motives of the would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania, one thing is certain. The man who attempted to kill Donald Trump believed his bullet would change the course of history for the better. Such thinking is common and is promoted in most school books that exhort young people to be better citizens by featuring the stories of national heroes who have changed the world. The killer’s belief that murdering a political leader could improve the nation was the logical converse of this mistaken principle. More

                              <span>Retired from Apple a few years ago (at age 57).
I was not obsolete. A big company like Apple, there are always things that need taken care of.
I assumed with iOS, Swift, etc., maybe the guys on the Cocoa team were obsolete? Of course not. That code is still there, still needs maintaining, interoperability with the new languages, frameworks, etc.
I&#x27;m more surprised they want to stay on.
And that is in fact why I left Apple: the job had changed, the &quot;career&quot; had changed. The engineers were no longer steering the ship. It had been that way when I started in 1995 though. A &quot;team&quot;, let&#x27;s say the graphics team, would figure out what API to revisit, what new ones to add — perhaps how to refactor the entire underlying workflow. The &quot;tech lead&quot; (who would regularly attend Siggraph since we&#x27;re talking about the graphics team) would make the call as to what got priority. Marketing would come around after the fact to &quot;create a narrative&quot; around all the changes to the OS. I hate to say it, but many, those were the good ole&#x27; days.
(And let&#x27;s be clear, in the 90&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s customers were more or less like the engineers, we also loved the machine for the same reasons they did — so we did right by them, made changes they would like because we wanted them too. You can&#x27;t say that as convincingly for the phone, being a mass consumer device.)
Marketing took the reins long ago though — especially as Apple began to succeed with the iPhone (which, someone can correct me if I am wrong, but I think was an engineer driven project initially — I mean most things were up to that point).
I stuck around nonetheless though because there was money to be made and kids still to raise.
When the last daughter flew the coop though, so did I.</span>

 These are times when it seems there are big discussions about the issue of cities, urban areas, about the possibilities of revolt inside them (even of living), of their reformability. Big discussions frequently focused on various topics relating to struggles carried out by many opponents, antagonists, often reformists, sometimes even by enemies of every order and authority; among these issues there is gentrification, a word not so unusual anymore, a word we now want to express some thoughts about.

We Are not Spectators but Enemies of all Forms of Dominion
 Today we wanted to give vent to a small anarchist impulse by brandishing the weapons of life and the ideas of rebellion. 
 As we are convinced that the status quo is being maintained not only by those who hold power but also by the servile attitude of those who tacitly support it, toady we decided to attack polling station 98a in the town of La Reina with an explosive/incendiary device.

 One time, maybe ten years back, I was on the DC metro with my family. My brother and I were happily talking about the feminist implications of GI Joe, because my brother is cool as hell, when a stranger looked over at my father (not knowing we were related) to complain about how I spoke. 
 “They really don’t teach people how to speak English anymore,” the stranger complained. 
 I’m not the world’s fighty-est person, but I’ve also never been the world’s least fighty person, so I confronted him immediately. “Oh?!” I asked. “What’s wrong with the way we’re talking?!”

 There’s not much to be said about an episode of repression, after all it’s the simple cyclical occurrence of action and reaction – or even on how repression plays dirty – another well-known fact. At most these are just a few notes on the development of techniques and strategies. 
 This I’ll try to do. More than a year after the arrests, with the trial already underway, a crack has opened in the censuring bell jar and the court papers been disclosed in all their misery after the short report on the last issue of Croce Nera and the latest developments on the closure of investigatio…</span>

Words acquire the meaning given by the person who uses them. We do not speak the language of the judges and prosecutors.

While this zine contains a couple sentences specific to so-called Boulder Colorado, it should still be broadly applicable, and we encourage people to print and distribute it anywhere that’s affected by extreme heat.

 148 years ago this week, on April 6, 1871, armed participants in the revolutionary Paris Commune seized the guillotine that was stored near the prison in Paris. They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians.

As well as raising local specifics, it hopes to encourage stronger awareness around wider issues of representation and counter-insurgency.

                              <span>I guess most of us have been exposed to the promotion of traveling by someone around us at least once in our lives. Like, how traveling around the world, seeing new places, having adventures and visiting museums are important and how life would be so bad without those.
Alright, I know they are not bad activities at all and they might be one of the ways to enrich our inner selves. But traveling is neither holy nor sacred.
In my 20s, I loved exploring new places. I hitchhiked around Eastern Europe, rode my touring bicycle along the coast in western Türkiye and went on numerous camping trips. Back then, these activities gave me a sense of freedom and the joy of meeting interesting people. Nowadays, these activities no longer bring me the same enjoyment.
These days, I do not enjoy traveling an…</span>

I am active in very few Discord servers and most of them are small, friends-only groups. However, in the few public ones I am in, I often see groups of people whose choices of words and how to express themselves, how to enter conversations, their tone and views make them feel eerily... unreal. I&#x27;ve thought about it, and the best way I could describe it is as if someone trained AI on the most active Twitter users. There is a specific flavor of overly cool, casually careless, sarcastic, flippant, at times vitriolic undertone to everything that is hard to …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m no longer under this specific NDA, so, I can talk a bit about this.
It was well known in the wireless industry that ATT collected and kept the most data on all of the carriers:  7 years for text metadata, &quot;7 years&quot; for call history (I put that in quotations because it was rumored that ATT kept them indefinitely, but, there were technical limitations for restoring data that far back), and 7 years for the contents of the text messages themselves.  Verizon was up there as well, but, I don&#x27;t remember specifics.
The carrier that I worked with kept only 3 days content of the actual messages, 28 days for the text message metadata, and 28 days for the call records for their enforcement database, but, they could get calling records and sms envelope information for billing back 7 years, and at the time, we had to implement sharding at the database layer that maintained the warrant database due to the amount of traffic that we were receiving from the calling systems and the amount of queries/data that we were sending out, in near realtime, to law enforcement users who paid $10,000/month for access to that data.
AT&amp;T wasn&#x27;t storing this data out of the kindness of their heart, it was a (probably small) revenue stream for them.</span>

                              <span>spotify is legal piracy. you can listen to most of your music by just paying a small amount and most of that doesn&#x27;t go to the artist. hell with the rise of AI, enshittification got to a level that it never has before. I just don&#x27;t want to be a part of that anymore.
there is also another reason I&#x27;m doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.

how I manage it
I download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn&#x27;t get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.
I use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.
notes
you can also take a look at kit&#x27;s post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.

                              <span>Yesterday I was watching a Swedish music documentary. In one of the scenes, the artist Errol (aka Eddie Meduza) says:
If you think too much, you go crazy. Take life as it comes.
True words — and all too easy to forget. We put so much emphasis on thinking in our modern society that the gut feeling, the inner vibe, has been overshadowed. We think like crazy, even in moments when thinking brings nothing but confusion and fatigue.
Thinking has an important role, of course. We can make great use of this ability to plan, prepare, and make calculated decisions. But often the best thing we can do is &quot;take life as it comes.&quot;</span>

There&#x27;s possibly a FISA court requirement (too secret to reveal), but AT&amp;T has long been an exceedingly willing part of the gov&#x27;s spying apparatus. It fed these records and Internet data to the feds without any court order, and only escaped legal troubles when Obama, contrary to his campaign promises, gave AT&amp;T, Verizon and more retroactive immunity</span>

                              <span>I wrote this to solve a few things I cared about.
* I want to show people that native WebRTC players can be a thing. I hope this encourages hangouts/discord/$x to implement WHIP and WHEP it would let people do so much more
* I wanted to make low latency sharing easier. I saw the need for this working on adding WebRTC to OBS and Broadcast Box[0]
* I wanted to show devs what a great ecosystem exists for WebRTC. Lots of great implementations in different languages.
* Was a bit of a ‘frustration project’. I saw a company claiming only their proprietary protocol can do latency this low. So I thought ‘screw you I will make an open source version!’

                              <span>The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn&#x27;t miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.
Perhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn&#x27;t a failure, it&#x27;s essential, especially for problems in systems you&#x27;ve never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn&#x27;t signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.</span>

They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.
The best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.
As a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.
If there&#x27;s one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They&#x27;ve done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.</span>

Laws related to data breaches need to have much sharper teeth. Companies are going to do the bare minimum when it comes to securing data as long as breaches have almost no real consequences. Maybe pierce the corporate veil and criminally prosecute those whose negligence made this possible. Maybe have fines that are so massive that company leadership and stockholders face real consequences.</span>

 Left and far-left forces dominated the Ukrainian political space. After the February Revolution of 1917, N. Makhno expanded his activities in the south of Ukraine, which turned into a powerful peasant movement. At first, N. Makhno and his movement did not have their own political program. He was strongly influenced by anarchist ideas, but during the revolution an independent ideological search developed in N. Makhno …</span>

                              <span>There are some people around us who live on a totally different frequency, especially in the work environment.
They never shut up.
They always seek a chance to talk to you.
They don&#x27;t let you have a peaceful and silent moment.
They talk but don&#x27;t say anything.
They do not understand that we just need peaceful and silent moment.
They do not understand that we don&#x27;t like them.
They expect attention and response.
It is hell when I see them around. I just cannot escape. I usually try to put my headphones on and listen to music at full volume. But this time, they wave their hand at me to talk to me - and in that moment I want to scream.
It does not matter if you give them very short answers and ignore. They never stop.

Because of this, I developed a habit of looking at the floor so that I won&#x27;t have eye contact with them. Sometimes I close my eyes and pretend to be sleeping. It&#x27;s so difficult to be kind sometimes. 

My social battery is already pretty weak and people who live on a different frequency are just torturing my soul. People like me should work at a cave or something like that. I lose my sanity when I want peaceful moment while having no escape.</span>

Swedish unions are governed from the top down and are therefore bad at serving workers&#x27; interests. So writes Rasmus Hästbacka of the syndicalist union SAC. Based on his new book, he suggests how worker-led unions can be rebuilt.
 It’s a truism that capitalism is not a democracy; capitalism means economic dictatorship, which is most evident in our workplaces.…</span>

Title: Some Radical Numerology

Illegalist Number
 There is some confusion,
 about the magnitude of revolutionary action,
 by individuals who live in civilization,
 and work,
 and pay taxes. 
 These individuals talk a lot about insurrection,
 and about revolution,
 and destitution,
 but seem in every way other than talk,
 to support the capitalist systems of oppression. 
 So in an effort to help all those who,
 by talking so much,
 confuse words with action,
 appraise the extent of their efforts toward their purported ends,
 we introduce the ILLEGALIST NUMBER. 
The Illegalist Number
sum of the damages done to the capitalist system,
through destruction,
expropriation,
fraud,

Title: What Does Putin Want?
Subtitle: The Russian autocrat is not crazy, war is simply a necessity for his power and economic system

 Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin outlined five goals for his war: Ukraine’s non-alignment with NATO; a change in Ukraine’s government; a severe limitation of Ukraine’s defence capacity; the seizure of Ukrainian territory (with international recognition); and the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia. 
 In the first weeks of the war, Putin also had a maximalist agenda: the quick occupatio…</span>

                              <span>Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.</span>

Prajna is a unique intuition that sees the true nature of things as they are (Yathabhutam). &quot;Zazen-shin&quot; (坐 禅 箴, Instruction in Zazen) by Dogen (1200 -1253) reads: &quot;A bird flies as a bird does; a fish swims likes a fish!&quot; The essence of things seen by Prajna or Yathatathyadarsana (如 実 見, seeing into the truth as it is) is named &quot;Suchness&quot; (tathata) or &quot;Emptiness&quot; (sunyata), because it is beyond our daily expression which is the result of discriminative consciousness …</span>
