                              <span>While policies to combat climate change are designed to address a global problem, they are generally implemented at the national level. Nevertheless, the impact of domestic climate policies may spill over internationally given countries&#x27; economic and financial interdependence. For example, a carbon tax charged to domestic firms for their use of fossil fuels may lead the firms to charge higher prices to their domestic and foreign customers; given the importance of global value chains in modern economies, the impact of that carbon tax may propagate across multiple layers of cross-border production linkages. In this post, we quantify the spillover effects of climate policies on forward-looking asset prices globally by estimating the impact of carbon price shocks in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on stock prices across a broad set of country-industry pairs. In other words, we measure how asset markets evaluate the impact of changes to the carbon price on growth and profitability prospects of the firms.</span>

These tragedies are a direct consequence of Israel’s illegal, U.S.-backed occupation of Palestinian territory and its war on Gaza, which must both end immediately. From the mass killing and maiming of Palestinian civilians to the forced starvation and deliberate destruction of Gaza’s health infrastructure, Palestinians and international experts have warned from the start that Israel is committing a “textbook case of genocide” in Gaza.

Students, staff and faculty have protested, picketed, rallied, and exercised a long tradition of “expressive activity” that has come to define the unique space that inhabits university life.

                              <span>(CW: Fat-shaming, dysphoria, discussions about body image issues)
I spoke to my Taiwanese trans friend last night about how our emotions changed post transition, and how I--personally--don&#x27;t get angry much (if at all) unless I&#x27;m severely stressed out, overstimulated, and then someone throws the final straw on the haystack.
...I may be talking about recent days, but hey.
My friend&#x27;s interjection came with a wry smile. &quot;You want to be likeable?&quot;
Obviously I paused at this question. It sounded vain and shallow, but this is Asia. Results matter more than intentions, as our parents would oft prove by pointing to our tests. It&#x27;s why so many Reincarnation and Cultivation stories exist. The proliferation of  skills in Asian fantasy exists to give you the result without hard work. And why would har…</span>

                              <span>As part of my job inspecting houses, I also assess the household&#x27;s fire safety. Often, important products like fire extinguishers and smoke alarms are missing.
If the customer is missing something and wants to purchase it, I have those kinds of products in my car. The sales are secondary, as a service to the customer, but I&#x27;m usually one of the technicians who sells the most.
Do I get a good commission for that effort? No. Do I work my butt off to be at the top? Never. Are our products the cheapest? Nope.
The simple reason is that I enjoy doing it. It&#x27;s a great feeling to leave a home safer than when I arrived. It feels satisfying and rewarding.
If I saw myself as a salesperson or recommended something I didn&#x27;t believe in, I could just as well drive around with an empty car. I wouldn&#x27;t sell a single product.
The same goes for my blog. I write about blogging because it interests and fascinates me. If I were to write about something just to be trendy or try to get more people to read my stuff, I&#x27;d get bored real fast. And my readers would too.
Regardless of what your goal is with your blog (if you have one), make sure it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re passionate about. Otherwise, both you and your readers will get tired of it.
No advertising or SEO beats genuine passion.</span>

                              <span>Like a lot of people who enjoy blogging and tech, my social media drug of choice is Mastodon. For those who don&#x27;t know, Mastodon is a platform where you can have (in my case) micro-blog posts of 500 words or less, as well as share photos. People can comment on what you wrote or repost it. They can also give you a little dopamine boost by clicking a star to indicate they liked what you posted. In that way, it is structured similarly to Twitter (X), Threads, and BlueSky.
Where Twitter and Threads are corporate-owned and centralized, Mastodon is just a platform, and anyone can get the software and set up their own server if they are tech-savvy. It can be confusing for newcomers to decide which server they want to join, but the good news is that you can join more than one, and you can also mov…</span>

                              <span>Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the &quot;break it up&quot; camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.
As for the rebuttal of &quot;bUt ThE gDp&quot;, there&#x27;s a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&amp;A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There&#x27;s another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart&#x27;s Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.
It&#x27;s worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&amp;T and Microsoft&#x27;s own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.</span>

                              <span>My concern, and IMO what should be the overwhelming concern of the maintainers, is not the code that is being written, or the code that will be written, but all the code that has been written, and will never be touched again. A break like this will force lots of python users to avoid upgrading to 3.17, jettison packages they may want to keep using, or deal with the hassle of patching unmaintained dependencies on their own.
For those Python users for whom writing python is the core of their work that might be fine.  For all the other users for whom python is an foreign, incidental, but indispensable part of their work (scientists, analysts, ...) the choice is untenable. While python can and should strive to be a more &#x27;serious&#x27;, &#x27;professional&#x27; language, it _must_ have respect and empathy for the latter camp.  Elevating something that should be a linter rule to a language change ain&#x27;t that.</span>

                              <span>I think I disagree with most of the comments here stating it’s premature to give the Nobel to AlphaFold.
I’m in biotech academia and it has changed things already. Yes the protein folding problem isn’t “solved” but no problem in biology ever is. Comparing to previous bio/chem Nobel winners like Crispr, touch receptors, quantum dots, click chemistry, I do think AlphaFold already has reached sufficient level of impact.</span>

                              <span>When I first heard the maxim that an intelligent person should be able to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time, I was naive to think it meant weighing them for pros and cons. Over time I realized that it means balancing contradictory actions, and the main purpose of experience is knowing when to apply each.
Concretely related to the topic, I&#x27;ve often found myself inlining short pieces of one-time code that made functions more explicit, while at other times I&#x27;ll spend days just breaking up thousand line functions into simpler blocks just to be able to follow what&#x27;s going on. In both cases I was creating inconsistencies that younger developers nitpick -- I know I did.
My goal in most cases now is to optimize code for the limits of the human mind (my own in low-effort mode) and like to be able to treat rules as guidelines. The trouble is how can you scale this to millions of developers, and what are those limits of the human mind when more and more AI-generated code will be used?</span>

                              <span>The author could use a bit of humility.
ISO isn’t useful in the author’s use-case. That’s fine, it is their project to do as they will. ISOs may still have uses elsewhere, such as PXE boot or just a near universally mountable read only container.
The author’s point to the age of the original ISO standard is irrelevant. Many old technologies are reliable and widely adopted, which in and of itself may make it superior to more modern technologies.
Author’s project, author’s will. But that was difficult to read due to their attitude and beyond the author’s use case, didn’t provide a reason for universally retiring ISO.</span>

                              <span>A key question in economic policy is how labor market tightness affects wage inflation and ultimately prices. In this post, we highlight the importance of two measures of tightness in determining wage growth: the quits rate, and vacancies per searcher (V/S)—where searchers include both employed and non-employed job seekers. Amongst a broad set of indicators, we find that these two measures are independently the most strongly correlated with wage inflation. We construct a new index, called the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index, which is a composite of quits and vacancies per searcher, and show that it performs best of all in explaining U.S. wage growth, including over the COVID pandemic and recovery.</span>

And don’t forget the existential danger. One small miscalculation and boom, there goes the neighborhood! In the 1970s, in the southwest corner of Germany, the tiny community of Wyhl was  More

The main problem with Blogs in 1997 is that it didn&#x27;t take long to realize nobody else cared about it.
The good thing about Blogs in 2024 is that you go into it knowing nobody will care about it. How Fucking Refreshing.
These days there are places to connect in 300 characters or less, places to manage &amp; moderate a growing community, and there are billionaire owned communities to help you become disappointed in your friends and family.
Sounds tedious AF.
I miss the ancient times when a simple RSS reader allowed people to lurk in the manner they preferred.
When an introvert could get a word in.
When you could fucking curse if it pleased you, because you&#x27;re an adult and sometimes things suck.
Ya know?!?
So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do here.
Curse.
But also share. With no pressure to be heard. And no pressure to respond.
If nothing else, a time capsule.
Of my journey in game development, and perhaps someday in setting up a studio. Video games have always been a wonderful escape for me. I&#x27;d call my game studio &quot;Escape Element&quot;. So that&#x27;ll be the blog&#x27;s name too.
But don&#x27;t be confused. This blog will be my personal take on things.
You could find all sorts of stuff here. It could be gamedev related stuff like art, music, or code (I dabble in all) ... or...
I may just need to rant about how stupid people are stupid.
Whatever is taking my attention at any given moment... I&#x27;m probably either in love with or pissed off at it, and it&#x27;s well past time I let the universe know about it.
If following along sounds like it may provide you with an element of escape, come on back.</span>

                              <span>On September 24 2024, the Commander Rules Committee put out their quarterly update detailing the newest batch of changes to the format. These changes consisted of banning four cards from the format: Dockside Extortionist, Jeweled Lotus, Mana Crypt, and Nadu, Winged Wisdom.
Less than a week later, the Commander RC – the independent group of fans who had controlled the game’s most popular format for over a decade – was no more.
What follows is an attempt at understanding how the world&#x27;s most popular card game got to this point.

If you&#x27;re unfamiliar: Commander is a casual Magic variant that has, in the last 10 years, become the most popular and widespread form of the game. In Commander, players play free-for-all multiplayer games, typically with four players, …</span>

It&#x27;s also better than constantly buying a million domains when I&#x27;m bored and want to start a new project. 😂 Three more are expiring this month; are you all proud of me?
By the end of the month I should have this Bear blog with the new domain and darker color themes more often than light color themes. I realize it&#x27;s ok to just do what you want with a personal blog. I have other websites that I can focus on better readability (like a dev blog) with light and dark modes.</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a piece of advice I&#x27;ve heard thrown around to composers a lot. You&#x27;ve probably heard it too.
&quot;You should try to write at least a little bit of music every day.&quot;
This is bad advice.
For a multitude of reasons that I won&#x27;t get into here, I&#x27;ve had a terrible few months. Just awful. My creative output has suffered as a result. I&#x27;ve still been making music, but it&#x27;s been a slow, painstaking process. Lots of staring at empty Cubase sessions, wondering why I can&#x27;t come up with any ideas. And while I have been happy with what I have managed to make, I haven&#x27;t had that feeling that happens when you make something you really, really love, like you&#x27;ve figured out how to transform a part of yourself into a track and release it to the world.
I didn&#x27;t fully realize it, but what I needed was a bre…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a homeowner, you know how daunting it can feel to paint your entire house at once. Hiring someone to do it can be expensive, and doing it yourself can seem overwhelming.
But what if you painted one side every other year? It suddenly becomes a much more manageable task. It can even be enjoyable, perhaps combined with a barbecue with your neighbors. Plus, your house always looks beautiful.
Starting a blog can feel similarly overwhelming. We see other bloggers posting regularly, creating every possible slash page, and participating in every blogging challenge that comes along.
Let go of all that pressure. Start at your own pace, in your own way.
Begin with just one post. It doesn&#x27;t have to be anything special, a paragraph or two is plenty. The main thing is to get started.
When the weekend comes, maybe you&#x27;ll sit down and create an &quot;About&quot; page. Now you have both a blog post and a page that describes you and your blog.
Step by step, you&#x27;ll build your blog on your own terms. No musts or deadlines. It&#x27;s your blog, you set the rules – no one else.
Soon, you&#x27;ll have painted a beautiful blog that looks great from every angle, year after year.

&gt;It’s kind of cool? Like you could imagine a hierarchy, in roughly ascending order of wealth:
&gt;Too poor to pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to not pay taxes.
&gt;Rich enough to not even bother with not paying taxes.</span>

I especially go back and forth on attribute inheritance (it can be disabled via the htmx.config.disableInheritance option)
Three of the criticisms boil down to the fact that client-side state doesn&#x27;t always play well w/htmx swaps (especially the simple ones) which is absolutely true.
And events can get crazy.  They are powerful, but crazy and at times hard to debug.  Such is event-driven life.
The one thing I don&#x27;t agree with is the default queuing mode: it is not to cancel an existing request and replace it.  Instead it is to keep the current request in flight and queue one and only one additional request.  I&#x27;d need to sit down w/them to see if they were misinterpreting something, using the hx-sync attribute to implement the behavior they mention, or if there is a bug.
I would also like to take this opportunity to market our mug for people who don&#x27;t like htmx:

                              <span>In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it&#x27;s 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail.
It&#x27;s my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren&#x27;t operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.)
Lot of preamble to say: no, I don&#x27;t think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.</span>

- Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store
- Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store
- Let Android developers set their own prices for apps irrespective of Play Billing
Removing those restriction on billing in the app will probably have way more impact in the end.</span>

From Google&#x27;s reply (https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-...): &quot;These Epic-requested changes stem from a decision that is completely contrary to another court’s rejection of similar claims Epic made against Apple — even though, unlike iOS, Android is an open platform that has always allowed for choice and flexibility like multiple app stores and sideloading.&quot;</span>

Well, I guess Google&#x27;s market cap is only 2 trillion compared to Apple&#x27;s 3 trillion, so I guess that&#x27;s fair.</span>

                              <span>Ruby and Rails really seem to be going through a renaissance lately.
- The pickaxe book, Programming Ruby, has a new edition this year covering Ruby 3.3
- The Rails Way is being updated for Rails 8 and is available in pre-release, and will have two companion books
- A new title, Rails Scales, is being published by PragProg and is available in pre-release now
- YJIT has made Ruby fast. Like, _FAST_
- Rails has a bunch of new features that cover the &quot;missing middle&quot; levels of success
- Ruby has a bunch of new and new-ish features like Data (immutable Struct), pattern matching, Fibers and Ractors, and more.
I had largely moved on from ruby into the world of front-end applications by 2013, but now I&#x27;m excited about the prospects of diving back in.</span>

                              <span>This reminds me of exploits we used to do to arcade cabinets back in Sydney in the 80&#x27;s and 90s. The school gas heaters used to have what we called &quot;clickers&quot;, piezoelectric ignition devices you could remove from the heaters.
You then took that clicker to your local arcade, and clicked one of the corners of the CRT, that would send a shock through the system and add credits to your game. I believe this was because the CRT was grounded on the same ground lines that the mechanism for physically checking a coin had gone through the system.
Suffice to say, they caught onto this over time, and added some form of an alarm into it. But up until then... Those were truly the best times.</span>

                              <span>This is one reason I believe &quot;right to repair&quot; laws are so important. The environmental damage of producing the device is already done. Make it last as long as possible. Reduce, reuse... then recycle.
Re-using devices helps us also reduce the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we&#x27;re not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?
Never the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I&#x27;ve been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5&#x27;s, 7&#x27;s, and 8&#x27;s that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.
But tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I&#x27;ve been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It&#x27;s as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!
And pick up a new hobby if you are able. Support your local tech geeks if you can!</span>

[Our comrade P. Kropotkin, having been asked by the Swedish Professor G. Steffen[1] to give his opinion upon the present war, gave it in a letter which we reproduce, with the additions he made to it in the three last paragraphs.]
 DEAR STEFFEN, — You ask my opinion’ about the war. I have expressed it on several occasions in France, and the present events, unfortunately, only reinforce it. I consider that the duty of every one who cherishes the ideals of human progress altogether, and especially those that were inscribed by the European proletarians on the banner of the International Working Men’s Associ…</span>

                              <span>I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.
One guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I&#x27;m afraid it will end up the same way.
Writing forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.
Of course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).
One annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.
On the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.
While I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)
P.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?</span>

                              <span>&quot;But I don&#x27;t know what to blog about.&quot;
I often hear that. Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don&#x27;t know what to write about. My answer is always the same:
&quot;Blog your way to the answer.&quot;
We can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.
Blog, blog, blog – that&#x27;s the solution.
We might come to realize that we don&#x27;t need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.
Or maybe we&#x27;ll realize that blogging isn&#x27;t our thing at all. Then at least we&#x27;ve tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn&#x27;t waste our time ruminating about it.
The only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It&#x27;s still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.
Many of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I&#x27;m really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog&#x27;s small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.
Who knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don&#x27;t have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:
Through blogging. Not through considering blogging.</span>

                              <span>In the modern Internet era, where our interactions with other people can be primarily or exclusively online, I&#x27;ve stopped distinguishing between IRL and online human beings. You are all real people to me. In my professional life, a good portion of my customers are voices on the telephone or composers of emails. My job is to solve problems for those people and their very real issues. Lots of times, but not always, I get a verbal or written &quot;thanks&quot; for helping them out, but I&#x27;d help them even if all I got was silence. People with good manners are a bonus.
Even with folks I first met by sharing the same physical space, most interactions tend to come through a computer monitor or cell phone screen. This includes my own flesh and blood. I see more pictures of my grandchildren on Facebook than …</span>

                              <span>As interest in understanding the economic impacts of climate change grows, the climate economics and finance literature has developed a number of indices to quantify climate risks. Various approaches have been employed, utilizing firm-level emissions data, financial market data (from equity and derivatives markets), or textual data. Focusing on the latter approach, we conduct descriptive analyses of six text-based climate risk indices from published or well-cited papers. In this blog post, we highlight the differences and commonalities across these indices.</span>

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led process of recovery that followed has not only been disastrous in terms of the economic policy package proposed by the Government. The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution (...)

                              <span>Since discovering my favorite types of blog posts are essay-like in anatomy and length, I&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of time to both writing and reading such posts. Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I&#x27;ll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I&#x27;ll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I&#x27;ve really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don&#x27;t always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.
When I post something in the morning, I&#x27;ll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don&#x27;t have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it&#x27;s a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I&#x27;ve also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me. I feel really good after blogging, and I don&#x27;t ever want that to change.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

                              <span>There arent any alternatives for major catastrophes that can top amplitude modulated radio.
if you are in a car fleeing for your life from a wildfire, major storm, or war, AM radio is available sometimes hundreds of miles from your location to provide timely instruction and lifesaving updates. if you need electricity for a radio, your car has fuel and can provide a radio signal to you for quite some time.
AM radio can be transmitted with a roll of wire and a relatively simple transciever from an FOB or refugee camp. digital radio requires codecs, licenses, and specialty equipment. Satellite radio may, or may not be available as the ground stations that power it require even more advanced transcievers and software to operate and could take months to repair if attacked or destroyed. Cellular towers require special beamforming antenna that can take months to rebuild or procure in an emergency and rely on an advanced system of transcievers and software to provide a signal.
its not Dolby quality, but if you need clean water and shelter it will guide you. Arguably you could mandate a VHF receiver in every car for FM based NOAA/EAS alerts, but AM is still cheaper.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I like to make silly things, and I also like to put in minimal effort for those silly things. I also like to make things in Rust…
I think this part is perhaps the silliest part of a very silly article. If you really like to put in a minimal effort then why on earth would you use Rust? If you want efficiency, memory management and a compiled modern language just use Go. Then you won’t even need anything but the standard library for what you want to do. Or… use Django as you suggest?
Yes, yes we use Rust in production because we thought it would be easier (well safer) to teach to interpreted language OOP developers than c/c++ but why on earth would you ever use it for the web unless you are a member of the cult?</span>

Title: Black and Red Rags
Date: 3 Oct 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/black-red-rags/

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…</span>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day. 
 Şehîd Tekoşer will always remind us of the fallen comrades,
 the beauty of struggle and the price of the defense of freedom.
 With our grief, we celebrate Lorenzo’s life …</span>

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…</span>

 When I first started my journey as an anarchist, I was incredibly privileged in both my environment and upbringing. I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. 
 Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…</span>

Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven&#x27;t liked, your posts?
Say hello to the &quot;unlikely&quot; button. It works like the standard button but doesn&#x27;t display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post&#x27;s popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: &quot;☆ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: &quot;Like it?&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: &quot;★ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: &quot;Thank you!&quot;;
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
