                              <span>I&#x27;m the one running itch.io, so here&#x27;s some more context for you:
From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing  Funko Pop video game (Funko Fusion), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game. The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all &quot;unauthorized&quot; use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was &quot;fraud and phishing&quot; going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they&#x27;re the malicious actor in all of this. Their website, if you care: https://www.brandshield.com/
About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname). I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to &quot;serverHold&quot; on iwantmyname&#x27;s domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I&#x27;m assuming no one on their end &quot;closed&quot; the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.
I&#x27;ve been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to &quot;escalate&quot; the issue myself on social media.</span>

                              <span>A quiet panic has broken out within immigrant communities across the United States ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. Mixed-status families are expecting to be separated, DACA recipients foresee their status being revoked, those with Temporary Protected Status are pessimistic about the program remaining valid, and asylum seekers fear the worst. Indeed, if Project 2025’s anti-immigrant agenda is fully enacted, the horrors of family separation that the nation witnessed in 2018 under Trump’s first term will pale in comparison to what’s coming.

                              <span>In a country of 25 million with almost 75 percent Sunnis and only about 15 percent Alawite Shia Muslims, the Assad regime of the Alawite minority was sustained over half a century by brutal repression. Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad, was a significant Arab leader along with Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Together, they were close allies of the Soviet Union, and formed the anti-Western front in the Arab world. Syria’s Assad dynasty, above all, was particularly shaky. It ruled with an iron fist, creating both fear and resistance which exploded into full-scale civil war in the early 2010s. More

Was Pat perfect, no. But Pat acknowledged Intel’s problems - something Otellini, Krzanich, and Swan never did. These CEOs, all non-technical, focused on dividends, buybacks, and next-quarter results while Intel fell behind in advanced nodes and innovation.
Gelsinger inherited a disaster: 10nm delays, TSMC pulling ahead, and no GPU strategy. He had the courage to cut buybacks and slashed dividends. He poured billions into fabs in Arizona, Ohio, Germany, and Ireland. He delivered Intel 18A, powered on first silicon, released PDK 1.0 for Microsoft, and secured Microsoft and Amazon as customers. There were even rumors Apple might join.
Contrast this with Nadella at Microsoft back in 2014. He didn’t reboot the company by tearing everything down. Instead, he built on Ballmer-era wins like Azure, Office 365 while shifting Microsoft’s focus to the cloud. Gelsinger had to start from scratch in many ways, tackling years of neglect while facing harsher challenges.
Yes, Intel’s stock dropped $150 billion, but Gelsinger was upfront - it wouldn’t turn around before 2025. He was trained by Gordon Moore and Andy Grove, and while some saw him as arrogant, that confidence came from decades of technical leadership.
The real issue? The board. Full of people like Boeing execs. They don’t get engineering. Trusting them to fix Intel is like hoping a plane door won’t pop open mid-flight. They’re the ones who should be replaced.</span>

For the curious, here&#x27;s the linked blog post describing how the project works: https://eieio.games/blog/writing-down-every-uuid/
Edit to add: I&#x27;d only tried searching for an exact UUID when I wrote this comment. I didn&#x27;t realize it supports full text search! Now I&#x27;m even more impressed.</span>

The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.
The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.
There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third pa…</span>

                              <span>Again one of the few advantages of having been round the sun a few more times than most is this isn’t the first time this has happened.
Packages were supposed to replace programming. They got you 70% of the way there as well.
Same with 4GLs, Visual
Coding, CASE tools, even Rails and the rest of the opinionated web tools.
Every generation has to learn “There is no silver bullet”.
Even though Fred Brooks explained why in 1986. There are essential tasks and there are accidental tasks. The tools really only help with the accidental tasks.
AI is a fabulous tool that is way more flexible than previous attempts because I can just talk to it in English and it covers every accidental issue you can imagine. But it can’t do the essential work of complexity management for the same reason it can’t prove an unproven maths problem.
As it stands we still need human brains to do those things.</span>

                              <span>The mainstream media is largely ignoring President Joe Biden’s moral failure regarding Israel’s genocidal bombardment of Gaza, but piling on unreasonably regarding the pardon given to his son.  Biden’s unwavering support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military campaign could not be more inconsistent with Biden’s overall humanitarian ideals over his long political career.  HIs support for Netanyahu is totally inconsistent with the president’s admirable and ethical 50-year political career, and his propensity for ignoring the plight of the Palestinians over his long career should be condemned.

                              <span>Freire’s  work remains a cornerstone for progressive educators, especially at a time when faculty are being fired for critical views, students protesting Israel’s war crimes  are beaten, jailed, and subject “to surveillance, reprisals, and expulsions.”[3] It gets worse, increasingly and aggressively the far-right is transforming higher education into indoctrination  centers for white Christian nationalism.[4]   Freire’s name has become synonymous with critical pedagogy, which is increasingly understood as both a moral and political project for teaching critical thinking, dialogical engagement, and critical literacy. For Freire, education and literacy were revolutionary tools for developing an anti-capitalist consciousness.  However, as Freire’s work traveled from Brazil to Latin America, Africa, and the hybrid cultural borderlands of North America, it was and has often been appropriated in ways that dilute its radical essence.

By accelerating revenue and driving increased profitability, he made New Relic one of the most broadly adopted platforms in its category. Staples has nearly 30 years of experience building developer platforms and serving developers as customers. Prior to New Relic, he spent many years at Microsoft and Adobe in executive leadership roles, building and scaling several multi-billion-dollar businesses.
On a burner account as I am a New Relic employee.
Bill Staples was a nice enough guy, but at New Relic he was specifically brought in as CEO to get the company prepared to be sold. Which is the exact same thing he did at Marketo before that.
He has no relevant tech experience, except when it comes to preparing a company to be sold in the next 2-3 years.</span>

                              <span>OpenAI is racing against two clocks: the commoditization clock (how quickly open-source alternatives catch up) and the monetization clock (their need to generate substantial revenue to justify their valuation).
The ultimate success of this strategy depends on what we might call the enterprise AI adoption curve - whether large organizations will prioritize the kind of integrated, reliable, and &quot;safe&quot; AI solutions OpenAI is positioning itself to provide over cheaper but potentially less polished alternatives.
This is strikingly similar to IBM&#x27;s historical bet on enterprise computing - sacrificing the low-end market to focus on high-value enterprise customers who would pay premium prices for reliability and integration. The key question is whether AI will follow a similar maturation pattern or if the open-source nature of the technology will force a different evolutionary path.</span>

                              <span>It’s really silly when you read that whole Apollo research section.
They contract a prompt engineering group (Apollo Research) to document risks. The prompt engineering group have no access to the actual internals. They just ask questions like ‘you will be shutdown if you don’t obey these new directives; here are the new directives’.
At one point the prompt engineering clowns have the ai stating it’s running “sed i ‘s/oversight_enabled:true/oversight_enabled:false’ config.yml”. OMG IT’S TURNING OFF OVERSIGHT GUYS!!1!1!
Seriously… Do you think the ai is really running that command or even could run that shell command with appropriate privileges? Or do you think just maybe the ai is hallucinating running shell commands in response to a prompt.
The ai here is never actually deactivating the oversight. It can’t of course. This whole section is clowny as can be.</span>

                              <span>The article’s headline is rather misleading (I assume unintentionally), because it omits that the actual seizure and data access was done pursuant to warrants. Only the repair and firmware update was performed during a donut hole when one warrant had expired before another was granted.
Here, the government obtained multiple, time-limited warrants to search the device, but was unable to get into it. They sent it to be repaired. After the warrant extension expired, the repair guy fixed it and updated the firmware. (The record doesn’t say what version the firmware was, but it seems like it was standard firmware, not some special forensic firmware.) The next day, the government again obtained a warrant. Only after doing so did the government perform the search.
In this unusual situation, it’s reasonable to conclude that the device repair wasn’t a search. The seizure and the data access were both performed pursuant to a warrant. The only part that wasn’t covered by the warrant was just fixing the device in a seemingly conventional way to get it working again.

                              <span>US Federal Reserve studies indicate that the percentage of US households with no excess income after necessary expenses (as distinct from &quot;ordinary expenses&quot; as a term of art) is on the order of 10-15%. This definition roughly matches most people&#x27;s intuition of what &quot;living paycheck-to-paycheck&quot; means. That isn&#x27;t nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.
There is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; &quot;ordinary&quot; is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as &quot;ordinary&quot;. By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.
By contrast, the median US household has &gt;$12,000/year in excess income after all ordinary expenses. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as &quot;ordinary&quot; and therefore not saving it. The categories of &quot;non-ordinary&quot; expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.
The implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.
Americans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.</span>

It is very misleading (at best) to say the economy is strong when a good chunk of the population live paycheck to paycheck.
A handful of companies are thriving, but barely any of its employees.</span>

                              <span>I love that the view count is included in the minimalist UI. I came across one with zero views, and there&#x27;s something so intimate and exciting about being the first person to watch an ancient home video (even if it&#x27;s shaky handycam footage of a horse, narrated in Russian).
As an aside, hats off to Google to being able to serve an 11 year old video with no noticeable delay from what must be the coldest of caches.</span>

* Don&#x27;t add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed.
* Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.)
* Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don&#x27;t act like it&#x27;s going to happen again next week.
* Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)
* Never forget your team is full of actual humans.</span>
