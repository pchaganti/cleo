Donors from society’s richest 1 percent pressured university administrators and political leaders to use police and other means to crush peaceful student protests. The students wanted a change in United States and Israeli policy and action to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Growing numbers of faculty are joining the students’ protests. They too have been unjustly persecuted by the same “authorities.” More

                              <span>Learning that some folks can produce so much value with crappy code.
I&#x27;ve seen entire teams burn so much money by overcomplicating projects. Bikesheding about how to implement DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, design patterns, complex queues that would maybe one day be required if the company scaled 1000x, unnecessary eventual consistency that required so much machinery and man hours to keep data integrity under control. Some of these projects were so late in their deadlines that had to be cancelled.
And then I&#x27;ve seen one man projects copy pasting spaghetti code around like there&#x27;s no tomorrow that had a working system within 1/10th of the budget.
Now I admire those who can just produce value without worrying too much about what&#x27;s under the hood. Very important mindset for most startups. And a very humbling realization.</span>

&quot;How can we design algorithms to detect...&quot; is the wrong question in response to this scandal—it&#x27;s completely in the wrong category. IMHO! These citation cliques are unsubtle and basically trivial to detect. It&#x27;s the professional work culture of research universities that&#x27;s the hard, unsolved problem.

How hard was it to relearn? at first I&#x27;d try to move my toe and something else would move, it felt weird - but doctor&#x27;s orders were essentially don&#x27;t do anything for 3 months, bed rest and keep the leg raised - all the muscles turned to jelly ... then months of physio, in the pool and then in the gym - at that point, once I started moving stuff again my brain had adjusted - that muscle moves my foot, not my toe - I didn&#x27;t have to do anything explicitly to make it change, it just did</span>

                              <span>I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Synopsis
 How can the link between city and child be made more fruitful and enjoyable for both the child and the city? 
 At a time when a significant proportion of the city’s children are at war with their environment, the question raised by this book becomes ever more urgent for teachers and parents, citizens and policy makers. Through an enormously rich range of refere…</span>

Title: International Workers Aid To Bosnia
Subtitle: Syndicalists truck flour directly to Bosnia unions
Date: December 1994
Notes: This article, from a presentation on June 1993 at the European Syndicalist Conference, appeared in Nov.-Dec. 1994 Industrial Worker newspaper

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

As we enter the eighth month of Israel’s genocidal campaign against Palestinians, the flow of weapons to Israel continues from the United States, Germany, Canada, Italy, Australia, and other Western countries. Even as some governments claim to have halted transfers or to not be sending weapons at all, they continue to provide licences or parts and components that are instrumental to the continuing onslaught. As people are now being pulled from the rubble in Rafah, in a strip of land already known as the world’s “largest open-air prison,” in a country and people bordered and confined by a violent settler colonial state, the relationships between the profiteers of the military-industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the border industrial complex come starkly into focus. And in the demands of the student encampments, the connections of these structures of state violence to universities becomes clear as well.

                              <span>Netanyahu addresses the Knesset.
Forgotten in the mainstream media’s coverage of the Israeli assault on Gaza—if it was ever known by the correspondents—is the long history of Netanyahu and Likud in the creation and support of Hamas. Despite the flood of reports and commentaries in the mainstream media no mention is ever made of Israeli’s complicity in creating and sustaining Hamas in order to split the Palestinians politically and to sever Gaza from the West Bank. That was done in order to prevent forever the establishment of a Palestinian state. For Likud and Netanyahu the greatest threat is peace. Peace would end the dream of Likud and its rightwing allies of an Israeli state that includes the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

                              <span>&gt; These days, some hobbyists opt for modern epoxy instead of the traditional and expensive Urushi lacquer. Epoxy probably yields a more robust bond and certainly allows for quicker repairs, but I question its safety for food-related use, especially at the temperatures found in a steaming cup of coffee.
People opt for epoxy because Urushi lacquer is traditionally made from poison oak sap and is a potent skin irritant to most people (it&#x27;s where urushiol gets its name). It&#x27;s really tough to do Kintsugi without smearing trace amounts of it all over the place, especially if you&#x27;re doing it with kids, and cleaning it off is a pain since it&#x27;s a hydrophobic sap. Even trace amounts can cause a reaction, especially if someone has sensitive skin or is severely allergic. People who do a lot of kintsugi develop a tolerance for it but it&#x27;s an annoyance that most hobbyists just don&#x27;t need.
Epoxies can be perfectly food safe and the FDA has a database [1] although it&#x27;s not particularly user friendly. You can get MAX CLR or similar from Amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in an oven above 300F but it&#x27;s fine for boiling temps. These FDA approved two part epoxies are used all over the place in hospitals and food manufacturing facilities where they&#x27;re used to coat rough surfaces that would otherwise harbor bacteria.

                              <span>&gt; What I find most strange about the modern day piracy is quality.
For a lot of pirates, it&#x27;s a niche hobby to preserve the best quality version of some media / art. I see it as an underground librarian archivist movement.
In 100 years iTunes may be dead, but there will be some person with every album available in high quality lossless FLAC. Same with Netflix and it&#x27;s bit starved encodes.</span>

                              <span>Napster was such an improvement over what it replaced, but, it’s funny by today’s standards Napster was so “basic”.
I remember waiting 3+ hours for a single song to download. Then discovering it wasn’t what I wanted but a troll who renamed the &#x60;Barney The Dinosaur I love you&#x60; song. Then I’d spend another 3+ hours downloading a different song. Ah 56k internet, what fun.
Today, TPB and a quick search can give you an artist’s entire discography in one go. Or if you’re into automation, lidarr , sonarr , and radarr can pull in your favorite things as soon as they’re released.
What I find most strange about the modern day piracy is quality. It blows my mind how different groups fight to offer the best version of a free thing. And they’re so good at it, that the pirated product is usually substantially better than the official version.</span>

Maybe that tinge of patriotism is why Americans don&#x27;t even bother to see if something isn&#x27;t an American invention - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_from_NPL_(MSF) - they&#x27;ll just claim it anyways since they barely read outside their borders.

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.

On Tuesday, Stacy Gilbert, a 20-year veteran of the State Department, resigned in protest, after charging that Biden’s State Department falsified a report on whether Israel was restricting the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza. Gilbert had been one of the Department’s experts helping to assemble the NSM-20 report to Congress assessing Israel’s compliance with US law in its military operations in Gaza. But she charges the report was removed from the experts before it was completed and its conclusions adulterated by the leadership of the department.

                              <span>Blog author here with a regretful correction. This result is not accurate, mea culpa. The headline should read: errors.Is() is 500% slower.
Basically: the critical functions in the benchmark are small enough they were being inlined by the compiler, which means it&#x27;s possible for the compiler to further optimize the loop to avoid all comparisons in some cases, producing an inaccurate result for some of the benchmarks. You can fix this by adding noinline directives to the methods.
I&#x27;ll be publishing an update to the article and a post-mortem on how this slipped past review. The rank ordering of techniques in the article is unchanged, but the magnitude of the difference is not nearly so large.</span>

Kind of sad, that I was surprised they did that. It&#x27;s definitely a local thing. I&#x27;d expect the police to shrug, and say it&#x27;s too bad, just file a report to use for insurance.
I remember people saying &quot;so what if you have tags, police won&#x27;t do anything and you shouldn&#x27;t be confronting thieves anyway&quot;.
Apple, on the other hand, is also explicit about tags not to be used as an anti-theft device. The word &quot;theft&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear even once on https://www.apple.com/airtag. It would be interesting if they still released a puff piece as a response: &quot;Oh look, a carpenter &#x60;found&#x60; his tools in the next state, in a warehouse along with other tools. We don&#x27;t know how they ended up there, but isn&#x27;t that great?&quot;</span>

                              <span>Just because there isn’t a “novel exploit” doesn’t mean this isn’t a big deal.
Snowflake is susceptible to their SE’s having credentials stolen. These credentials can bypass MFA. And per the article, they have no expiry. That’s strikes one, two, and three.
Snowflake’s security practices lead to a situation where their customers are either required, or at minimum encouraged, to share access to broad datasets with Snowflake employees. That’s strike four.
Yes, there is also issue here that the customers are responsible themselves for not granting too broad access, and that’s on them. But it’s also on Snowflake for not having a better system that doesn’t require this access, or at minimum not having better oversight and control over this transitive access.
Once these accounts are granted access to a customer’s data, they aren’t “demo accounts” anymore. They’re real accounts, with real, very valuable data, and they should be treated as such.
Edit to add: it is worth noting that Snowflake claims the demo account did not have access to customer data and wasn’t the source of the leak, which is in contradiction with what the attackers claim.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t work for Snowflake but I spend a lot of time working with them and their SE organisation.
When working and building demos with clients, SEs create demonstration environments on the same $400 Snowflake demo accounts anyone can. To build demos the client would grant access to that SE. The SE would take some of the data to the demo environment and then work on it. This is further confirmed by the name of the environment Hudson Rock just published.
As far as I can tell, this is a process issue of clients not expiring an ID of someone who they were sharing data with and a threat actor swiping credentials. There is nothing novel about this as there is no exploit.
Also congrats Hudson Rock you just outed a person who was taken due to having malware on their computer. This is no different then if you gave a contractor credentials and they had those swiped. Dicks.</span>

                              <span>When I read stories about companies like Spotify creating e-waste like this, I think it’s worth pointing out that commercial companies don’t have to behave this way.
As a counter-point, back around 2008, I purchased two Squeezebox music players from Logitech (digital music players that Logitech had acquired from Slim Devices: high quality DACs that supported every audio format, gap-less playback, synchronised playing on multiple devices, and were very configurable).
They discontinued these products four years later (2012) but kept their mysqueezebox.com online service running up until the start of this year (2024). They kept the user forums running and archived the knowledge-base wiki. Most importantly, they open-sourced the stand-alone server software for running a local Squeezebox server and continued to pay the main developer to maintain the project for more than a decade after they discontinued the products. He’s still the lead developer and project maintainer of the server software, now called Lyrion Music Server: https://lyrion.org/
Correction: the stand-alone server software was always open source, specifically GPLv2. In addition to the audio quality and features, that was one of the selling points for me. It being written in Perl, meant that it was both cross-platform and easy to run on a GNU/Linux system.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s SUCH a win that they managed to roll this out to a small set of tax situations and states to start. Every government project I&#x27;ve been on has required creativity in defining an MVP that doesn&#x27;t include shipping to everyone. This was cited consistently as one of the great successes of this project, they were able to ship something that successfully filed 150k taxes b/c they were able to scope things down to something doable in 9 months.</span>

                              <span>I just read Paved Paradise as well as The High Cost of Free Parking. This seems like the current gradual trend towards reversing the hidden subsidy for drivers, first by giving them less affordances at remarkably low prices or for free.
A few folks in the comments have mentioned a couple of times that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to make a policy like this without supporting transit. I believe the argument would be that not creating induced demand will provide market effects to encourage the use of transit, which would then create greater demand for improved transit.
Similarly for housing, the well substantiated claim from modern urban planners is that we&#x27;ve been prioritizing housing for cars well beyond housing for people, and the best solution for that is to overturn minimum parking requirements and unbundle the cost of parking from the cost of housing.
Personally, I still find these opinions somewhat counterintuitive. The weirdest part about it is that it all posits that the solution to a centralized planning problem is market solutions, and it&#x27;s coming from people you&#x27;d expect to have the opposite opinion. However, what we&#x27;ve had in terms of transportation clearly doesn&#x27;t work for people and for the environment, and the last 20 years of &quot;Shoupism&quot; has shown some serious promise in terms of reversing the trend.</span>

                              <span>Are they just banking on people not caring enough or knowing about the refund process? Clearly it can&#x27;t be better off for them to refund hundreds of thousands maybe even 1m+ people.
We need laws that step in to make this impossible. Hardware should be designed so that it can be reused. Make it so that people can just reflash the memory at a minimum. There&#x27;s no reason for something like this to become e-waste. And the excuse being Spotify wanting to protect their brand should not stand.</span>

                              <span>The term “open access” is misleading and carefully engineered to generate good will, when in fact it should be termed “pay to publish” (as argued quite nicely by Brian McGill [1]). As it stands today, OA is mostly a public money sink, a big scheme to drain public money from European countries. Not only are we paying a ridiculous, ungodly amount of money for people to host PDFs on a website, but the entire idea of publishers competing for the quality of their research output (in order to get submissions) has also basically been eradicated and turned meaningless. Reviewers are pushed to accept papers instead of rejecting them, because a rejected paper makes no money, and now we are left with a deluge of noise that passes for scientific literature. I sincerely pity the PhD student who needs to run a serious, systematic literature review in 2024. Hell sounds more attractive.
If you want open access, ditch the publishers and fund volunteer expert communities to edit and publish their own papers. You can’t have the cake and eat it too.

                              <span>&gt; I bet that WhatsApp is one of the rare services you use which actually deployed servers to Australia. To me, 200ms is a telltale sign of intercontinental traffic.
So, I used to work at WhatsApp. And we got this kind of praise when we only had servers in Reston, Virginia (not at aws us-east1, but in the same neighborhood). Nowadays, Facebook is most likely terminating connections in Australia, but messaging most likely goes through another continent. Calling within Australia should stay local though (either p2p or through a nearby relay).
There&#x27;s lots of things WhatsApp does to improve experience on low quality networks that other services don&#x27;t (even when we worked in the same buildings and told them they should consider things!)

                              <span>A lot of this resonates. I&#x27;m not in Antartica, I&#x27;m in Beijing, but still struggle with the internet. Being behind the great firewall means using creative approaches. VPNs only sometimes work, and each leaves a signature that the firewall&#x27;s hueristics and ML can eventually catch onto. Even state-mandated ones are &#x27;gently&#x27; limited at times of political sensitivity. It all ends up meaning that, even if I get a connection, it&#x27;s not stable, and it&#x27;s so painful to sink precious packets into pointless web-app-react-crap roundtrips.
I feel like some devs need to time-travel back to 2005 or something and develop for that era in order to learn how to build things nimbly. In deficit of time travel, if people could just learn to open web tools and use its throttling tool: turn it to 3g, and see if their webapp is resilient. Please!</span>

                              <span>I love my blog! I really do! I want to write every day. But I don&#x27;t. Why? Because of the Perfection Bug!
&quot;You need to share a unique thought&quot;
&quot;Your idea should be worth penning&quot;
&quot;You need to write in great detail&quot;
Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.
But today, I decided to squash that bug!
I don&#x27;t need unique thoughts. I don&#x27;t need amazing ideas. I don&#x27;t need to explain things in detail.
All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all I need to write on my blog.
So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to messing with the blog&#x27;s CSS! I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.
I&#x27;ve also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...
While I&#x27;m deciding, please enjoy the croissant button. It&#x27;s given me more serotonin than it should.</span>

                              <span>One of the core responsibilities of central banks is to act as “lender of last resort” to the financial system. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has been operating as a lender of last resort through its “discount window” (DW) for more than a century. Historically, however, the DW has been plagued by stigma—banks’ reluctance to use the DW, even for benign reasons, out of concerns that it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness. In this post, we report on new research showing that once a DW facility is stigmatized, removing that stigma is difficult.</span>

But much Democratic opposition exists in the form of incentives for green energy industries, for example, those built into the Inflation Reduction Act. In terms of actually holding climate polluters accountable, other than Biden’s budgetary proposal to end tax breaks (which is, after all, only a proposal), and a pause on natural gas permits, Democratic challenges have come in the form of “homework assignments for companies, and requests for Justice Department investigations,” wrote Axios reporter Ben German.

Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven&#x27;t even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.
This is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I&#x27;ll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through &#x27;husband&#x27; will catch in my mouth and &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; will slip out instead.

                              <span>Can you read them?  Speech to text perhaps.  That can also be done locally.
If a note&#x27;s a minute, 1000 notes are around 16 hours of reading.  Scale time needed depending on if it takes less or more than a minute to read.  Add a note reference to the start of each recording, like a zettelkasten, so the scanned file, recording and text cross-reference.
If assessing other solutions, that&#x27;s at least an upper bound on the cost of any other solution.</span>

                              <span>I have seen Will Larson&#x27;s techniques applied/ forced in multiple organizations and have found that his view of the engineering world just does not work. I sense that there is a cult of personality around him that leads to engineering ivory towers.
Most orgs that I&#x27;ve seen follow his writing or ideas have ended up in conflict with the business and one another, isolated on a corporate island, and then gutted by layoffs.
I don&#x27;t like to throw an author/engineer under the bus but I do not know why this guy has a following. I have never seen his methods result in happy engineers and delivered value.
My summary of this article (for managers):
1. Micromanage early and often
2. Measure, and whatever you&#x27;re measuring, act like it&#x27;s truth and that you know best.
3. Listen to the curmudgeons and the naysayers because they are the true sources of knowledge.
Edit- as I mention in a reply, try https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-dev... Ron Jeffries&#x27; &quot;The Nature of Software Development&quot;. Incremental value, engineers leading delivery, constant feedback cycles, flexibility. I&#x27;ve followed the tenets of this book in many orgs, and they lead to measurable value, happy engineers, and successful orgs.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know, that sounds like a complex kind of ingest which could be arbitrarily subtle and diverge over time for legal and bureaucratic reasons.
I would kind of appreciate having two formats, since what are the odds they would change together? While there may never be a 3rd format, a DRY importer would imply that the source generating the data is also DRY.</span>

Oh no, more of this.
What about less used options? How much slower? How much less discoverable?
Desktop applications are already for power users almost by definition, let’s not slow them down for the sake of reducing “clutter”. Absolutely annoying trend of the last 15 years or so.</span>

MK: Hello and welcome to THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES, a podcast for and about queer and neurodivergent kids and teens living out anarchy and youth liberation. 
 Here at THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES we believe that youth autonomy is not only crucial to queer and trans liberation, but to anarchy itself. Governance is inherently based on projecting linear narratives of time and Development and gender onto our necessarily asynchronous and atemporal queer lives, and kids, teens, and everyone else affected by anti-child ageism are at the center of this form of oppression.

 The first impression produced upon a stranger by a village in Great Russia is undoubtedly gloomy. The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. 
 The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes. Sometimes, when f…</span>

 Much has been written lately in condemnation of the free libraries, on the ground that they were chiefly used by those who cared only for light reading, and that the more serious books were rarely in demand. It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…</span>

 THE Russian educated woman is known to some extent in this country for the part which she took in the struggles for political freedom. Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. 
 If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…</span>

 THE necessity of growing more foodstuffs in this country has perhaps never been so evident as it is now. That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming? Could not, let us say, several County Councils, especially in those counties where there are patches of a lighter soil, establish a number of sm…</span>

 The train had just arrived at the station of N—–, an out-of-the-way place on one of the branches of the South-Eastern system. The few travellers alighted—three men and a woman—and stood on the platform, waiting till the way was deal- to cross to the other side and make their way out. 
 The men belonged in the vicinity and knew each other. They talked together, while the woman—a young brunette, thin and poorly dressed in black—stood apart, leaning on the railing. Her eyes roved over the surrounding country and seemed to s…</span>

I wake up, do what I have to do to keep my scholarship and my body in decent condition, and go to sleep. Repeat. My days have a rhythm I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy, because college life is the same stressful day over and over again, with a little respite here and there. And it&#x27;s like, God, I&#x27;m 20 years old. I should be at the club.
But life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don&#x27;t know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend. Being able to take it slow in the morning, enough to think about things like this, is rare.
I&#x27;m alive. That&#x27;s something.</span>

                              <span>One of the iron laws of people being creative on the internet is that it’s only a matter of time until the haters arrive.
Yesterday on Twitter, I saw post after post mocking the increasing popularity of bearblog, the “bear”-bones blogging platform that simply gives people a blank slate and lets them go at it. One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. &quot;Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...&quot;
To the contrary - I&#x27;m loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.
In this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest. Amidst it all, bearblog stands tall as a quiet, &quot;old-internet&quot; venue -- a corner of the web well worth preserving.</span>

                              <span>I recently read Kristin&#x27;s post where she notes that a lot of blogs have a very serious tone to them, and laughed because it was something I clocked too, at least in my own posting behavior recently!
I think I naturally like to reflect, but I&#x27;d noticed that whenever I came on here, I found myself endeavoring to write Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter1, because a lot of the posts I read were (either intentionally or naturally) Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I&#x27;m happy for the reminder to unclench. Honestly, I personally prefer reading the day-to-day, thesis-less stuff myself.2
Last Sunday I went on an overnight staycation with my friends at a small villa on the outskirts of the city! It started out a little …</span>

                              <span>I recently came across a tweet that rubbed me the wrong way.
It stated: &quot;Mediocre people often have a clear tell: you&#x27;ll often see them hanging out with other mediocre people, probably because the A+ folks avoid them.&quot;
This reeks of the kind of elitist, self-congratulatory attitude that plagues certain circles. Who determines what makes someone &quot;mediocre&quot; or an &quot;A+&quot;? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.
Excellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don&#x27;t just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of &quot;A+ folks.&quot; The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.
Perhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...
 and I&#x27;ve all fallen for the bait.</span>

Nevertheless, a narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system. Some market participants have similarly linked the apparent increase in official demand for gold in recent years to a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.</span>

Since the end of the apartheid regime three decades ago, the African National Congress (ANC) has won all the elections with substantial majorities. But this time there is the possibility that the ANC will poll less than 50% of those voting.

The media, the schools, the judges, the cops, politicians, surveillance, technology, work. All have their role to play in repression. [1]
 Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance. All these words are difficult to discuss because they combine personal experiences with repressive practices deliberatel…</span>

Killing King Abacus
 To Kill King Abacus is to create relations without measure. If we aim to destroy capitalism we cannot reproduce its necrophilic logic which reduces relationships to numbers. To Kill King Abacus is to destroy the social net which privileges mediated transactions and images over direct relations. Because money is a general equivalent and thus is nearly limitless in its applications, it conquers other signifiers of value; capitalism transforms other value systems into itself.

Title: Errico Malatesta: A Brief Biography
Date: 2020
Notes: A brief biographical statement used to preface a reader for the DSA LSC Political Education Working Group&#x27;s Malatesta Reader, which was used in a series of study circles in 2020 to explore Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Towards Anarchy,&quot; and &quot; An Anarchist Programme&quot;.

 Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Italy on 14 December 1853. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II .

                              <span>Recently, I came across a content creator who stated that the antidote to the overconsumption of media content or any sort of information is creation, and it struck a chord with me.
My name is Fatine, I am a 23-year-old student, and that is all you need to know for now.
My consumption tendencies are not unique to me. The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.
During these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.</span>
