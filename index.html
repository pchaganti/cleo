Abstract
 The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…</span>

Title: Anarchists Against Counter-Revolution
Date: 9/7/2024

 There has been a disturbing trend within anarchism in the last few years. It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. 
 The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently &#x27;anarchist.&#x27; 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to &#x27;anarchist&#x27; batt…</span>

 Note: The present passage was written on 11-16 December 2002 (period of the Cyprus entry into the European Union) by anarchist prisoner Giorgos Garakasian in the jails of free Cypriot democracy. 
 Through the general secretary of United Criminals Kofi Annan the Americans and British have been attempting for some time now to impose a ‘fair and viable solution’ upon the inhabitants of Cyprus. 
 The period that we are living in is characterized by the reorganization of global dominion, which has completed its first phase of ‘anti-terrorist’ hysteria with the devastating intervention in Afgha…</span>

Battery replacement costs at Apple are $69-99 and offered all the way back to the iPhone SE 1st Generation. That&#x27;s the all-in cost where you bring it in, they open it up, swap it out, and give your phone back to you.
An OEM battery for an Android phone is like $50.
Budgeting $69-99 once every 3-4 years hardly seems like it&#x27;s going to nuke their business from orbit.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m conflicted.
It&#x27;s absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models &quot;boring&quot;.
The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I&#x27;ll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.
She can&#x27;t tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.
You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back.
You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn&#x27;t notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn&#x27;t know they even exist.
All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.
You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she&#x27;s highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It&#x27;s not that she&#x27;s unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn&#x27;t care.
It&#x27;s becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.
I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don&#x27;t buy the pro and they&#x27;re desperate for selling points in the regular model.
If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.</span>

                              <span>You sound like you&#x27;re proud of this work and this plan and this sequence of events.
code.google going away, without the excuse that google itself was going away, after I had started to rely on it and link to it in docs and scripts all over the place, is what taught me to never depend on google for anything.
If google had said &quot;The purpose of this service is an academic goal of Googles, not to serve users needs. This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.&quot; I would not have used it.
But Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.
Do you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it&#x27;s own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn&#x27;t even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.
So thanks for all your work making the world a better place.</span>

Don&#x27;t think about it. If you happen to notice it, try to distract yourself immediately. There maybe legitimate hearing damage but for the psychological aspect, the more you think about it the worse it becomes. I think I saw a quora answer somewhere where the doctor said &quot;Nobody complains about tinnitus while playing Playstation&quot;. And it&#x27;s very true. Until this post just now, I hadn&#x27;t thought about it in weeks (months?).</span>

                              <span>Actually, Google Code was never trying to win.
It was simply trying to prevent SF from becoming a shitty monoculture that hurt everyone, which it was when Google Code launched.  Google was 100% consistent on this from the day it launched to the day it folded. It was not trying to make money, or whatever
I was there, working on it, when it was 4 of us :)
So to write all these funny things about taste or what not, is totally besides the point.
We folded it up because we achieved the goal we sought at the time, and didn&#x27;t see a reason to continue.
People could get a good experience with the competition that now existed, and we would have just ended up cannibalizing the market.
So we chose to exit, and worked with Github/bitbucket/others to provide migration tools.
All of this would have been easy to find out simply by asking, but it appears nobody bothers to actually ask other people things anymore, and I guess that doesn&#x27;t make as good a story as &quot;we totally destroyed them because they had no taste, so they up and folded&quot;.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s pretty funny to me that this is used as a hit-piece against AI generated content. Here&#x27;s an open-secret for everyone: web-based sports content companies have been automatically generating content articles for at least a decade; way before LLMs became popular.
It is and was mostly done for search ranking. The more seemingly applicable content, the better your SEO.
This situation has probably happened several times before AI but has gone unnoticed or noticed to little fanfare. It&#x27;s more indicative of ESPN not having its finger to the pulse and ensuring that one of the copywriters manually updated this particular article. It&#x27;s not too surprising to me. They&#x27;ve always been known to favour quantity over quality.

                              <span>There are a number of concrete problems:
- syscall interfaces are a mess, the primitive APIs are too slow for regular sized packets (~1500 bytes), the overhead is too high. GSO helps but it’s a horrible API, and it’s been buggy even lately due to complexity and poor code standards.
- the syscall costs got even higher with spectre mitigation - and this story likely isn’t over. We need a replacement for the BSD sockets / POSIX APIs they’re terrible this decade. Yes, uring is fancy, but there’s a tutorial level API middle ground possible that should be safe and 10x less overhead without resorting to uring level complexity.
- system udp buffers are far too small by default - they’re much much smaller than their tcp siblings, essentially no one but experts have been using them, and experts just retune stuff.
- udp stack optimizations are possible (such as possible route lookup reuse without connect(2)), gso demonstrates this, though as noted above gso is highly fallible, quite expensive itself, and the design is wholly unnecessarily intricate for what we need, particularly as we want to do this safely from unprivileged userspace.
- several optimizations currently available only work at low/mid-scale, such as connect binding to (potentially) avoid route lookups / GSO only being applicable on a socket without high peer-competition (competing peers result in short offload chains due to single-peer constraints, eroding the overhead wins).
Despite all this, you can implement GSO and get substantial performance improvements, we (tailscale) have on Linux. There will be a need at some point for platforms to increase platform side buffer sizes for lower end systems, high load/concurrency, bdp and so on, but buffers and congestion control are a high complex and sometimes quite sensitive topic - nonetheless, when you have many applications doing this (presumed future state), there will be a need.</span>

You might also get a lot of mockery and derision and not much respect. Where ever I go on the social web, I have to ask myself what my purpose is. There are ways of manipulating lots of different platforms so that the clicker next to your user name goes up. One of the buzz words that gets tossed around on different platforms is engagement. It is usually a quantitative term having to do with the number of likes or followers your &quot;content&quot; has. Content is also a buzzword and one I don&#x27;t like very much.

                              <span>The evidence suggests that empires often react to periods of their own decline by over-extending their coping mechanisms. Military actions, infrastructure problems, and social welfare demands may then combine or clash, accumulating costs and backlash effects that the declining empire cannot manage. Policies aimed to strengthen empire—and that once did—now undermine it. Contemporary social changes inside and outside the empire can reinforce, slow, or reverse the decline. More

There are so many tools that make it easy to build and deploy apps to your servers (with or without containers) and all of them showcase how easy it is to go from a cloud account to a fully deploy app.

                              <span>Unavoidable evidence of the catastrophic consequences of climate change confronts us at every turn. Record high ocean temperatures. Once-a-century storms that appear every other year. And on and on. In the face of ongoing ecological disaster, international best-selling author Kōhei Saitō asks why our society continues to prioritize corporate profits (and the rapacious expansion on which they depend), and proposes a revolutionary alternative to unfettered capitalism: degrowth communism.
In Slow Down, Saitō provocatively argues that any solutions that don’t directly confront capitalism itself—from the COP agreements to the “Green New Deal”—represent dangerous compromises that may ultimately worsen the climate emergency. Because it creates artificial scarcity and endlessly produces commodities based on their value, rather than their usefulness, our economic system itself makes it impossible to reverse climate change so long as capitalism remains in place. The biggest contributor to the problem cannot be an integral part of its solution.
Instead, Saitō advocates for degrowth and deceleration, which he conceives as the slowing of economic activity through the democratic reform of labor and our system of production. By returning to a system of social ownership, degrowth communism, we can restore the abundance of things that we truly need, and can focus on those activities that are essential for human life.
What would this alternative look like? How do we end mass production and mass consumption without reducing living standards? What do we need to do to redress global inequality without accelerating the rate at which the planet burns?
For this launch event Saitō will be in conversation on all of this, and more, with Science for the People editor, and Pilsen Community Books collective member and CounterPunch Radio co-host Erik Wallenberg. This event occurred on May 24, 2024 at Haymarket House in Chicago. More

Although any country that challenges domination by United States corporate or military power will inevitably be the target of a sustained demonization campaign, the lies consistently issued in a torrent against Venezuela are beyond the usual level of invective. Venezuela is the most lied-about country in the corporate press of the Global North, especially in U.S. corporate media outlets.
That Venezuela has sought to align its economy to benefit its own people, instituting an impressive array of social services, health programs and political structures to facilitate grassroots participation, has drawn the consistent ire of U.S. authorities. An unrelenting cascade of lies is necessary to generate public support for the unrelenting campaign targeting the Bolivarian Revolution.

This quotation usually attributed to Thomas Jefferson, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” is a watchword that investigative reporter Greg Palast lives by. Since the contested 2000 presidential election, Palast’s voting vigil has probed America’s electoral system and abuses of it. The journalistic detective chronicled purported purging of mostly Black citizens from Florida’s voter rolls in his landmark 2002 book The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and a 2016 documentary version updated for the Trump era with the same title. Now this steadfast watchdog of voters’ rights is back with a new nonfiction cinematic inquiry wherein the reportorial gumshoe is vigilant about Vigilantes Inc.: America’s New Vote Suppression Hitmen, and Georgia is on Palast’s mind.

                              <span>Image Gallery for Bear Blog
This gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It&#x27;s also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.
Actually, the gallery add-on itself isn&#x27;t very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here&#x27;s the result (instructions below):









Instructions
The gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a &quot;section&quot;) with the class gallery. Example:


* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Since the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:


* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Finally, add the following style to your theme:
/* Gallery */
.gallery ul  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
  padding: 20px 0;
  list-style: none;
}
.gallery li {
  position: relative;
  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


There have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.
I hope you find the gallery useful!</span>

                              <span>When I went to the APS March Meeting earlier this year, I talked with the editor of a scientific journal and asked them if they were worried about LLM generated papers. They said actually their main worry wasn&#x27;t LLM-generated papers, it was LLM-generated reviews.
LLMs are much better at plausibly summarizing content than they are at doing long sequences of reasoning, so they&#x27;re much better at generating believable reviews than believable papers. Plus reviews are pretty tedious to do, giving an incentive to half-ass it with an LLM. Plus reviews are usually not shared publicly, taking away some of the potential embarrassment.</span>

                              <span>Wow. Thank you for posting this.  I am fifty years old.  In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school.  During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying.  Life happened.  He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin.  I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college.
Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew.  He did not have the best life, but he always smiled.  When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad.  When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked.
After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy…</span>

                              <span>Email accounts are the highest common denominator in online authentication. Phones are competitive, but people lose phones. Phone numbers are more common and durable, but the security of phone numbers is leagues below that of a flagship provider email account. It makes sense that so many authentication flows work this way.
When designing a &quot;fantasy football&quot; alternate authentication system for the Internet, start with account recovery: what happens when a user loses your fancy authenticator? If the answer is &quot;they just don&#x27;t get access anymore&quot; or &quot;a panel of their peers attests to them&quot;, your fantasy authentication system also needs a fantasy species of sentient beings to serve as users, because it won&#x27;t work for humans.</span>

In the first week I was walking her and passed a bus stop mainly used by school kids. There&#x27;s a small wall behind it and she dashed around and emerged with half a sausage roll hanging out of her mouth.
To this day, every time we pass that spot she enthusiastically pulls and goes round to inspect.</span>

                              <span>&gt; the longest post on my site, takes 92 KiB instead of 37 KiB. This amounts to an unnecessary 2.5x increase in load time
Sure, if you ignore latency. In reality it&#x27;s an unnecessary 0.001% increase in load time because that size increase isn&#x27;t enough to matter vs the round trip time. And the time you save transmitting 55 fewer KiB is probably less than the time lost to decompression. :p
While fun, I would expect this specific scenario to actually be worse for the user experience not better. Speed will be a complete wash and compatibility will be worse.</span>

                              <span>Wow! Never thought about it like this before:
&gt; Because Japanese text is read from right to left, the earliest viewers of The Great Wave would have likely read the print that way too, first encountering the boaters and then meeting the great claw of water about to swallow them. So instead of riding along with the gargantuan wave as you might in a left-to-right reading, they would face right into the massive wall of ocean.

                              <span>I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.
For those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.
So back to the update…
Key Updates
Changing the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.
You will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).
There is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.
A battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.
The long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.
The counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.
Updated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).
The response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!
…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.
Sample photos
Photos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.
If you&#x27;re interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they&#x27;re shipping these new cameras now.

                              <span>When I was first diagnosed with depression, I found myself going down the rabbit hole - Reddit posts from ten years ago, outdated mental health forums, and scattered blogposts written by other people with depression. In a sense, I felt like a pariah compared to my peers, and I was curious how depression manifests in others compared to me, because, despite living with this condition for years, I was clueless about what it was.
People tend to think that the most telltale sign of depression is sadness, but I discovered depression manifests overwhelmingly different across individuals: those who experience the crushing sadness, those with the intense mood swings, or those with detachment from their lives.

I decided to slow down on my blog posting this week following the end of Blaugust. I have been struggling with words lately but pushed through the momentum of posting daily during August. Now I’m spending some time collecting letters to be able to fully form words and sentences again. Great advice from Courtney in that post.
I have been eyeing the reMarkable for a couple of years now but can never justify buying it when I have a perfectly good iPad Pro for notes. I still want it. They just came out with reMarkable Paper Pro, which is a colored version. The costs is nearly the same as an iPad. Ugh. I hate being financially responsible and constantly asking myself: Do I really need this?

                              <span>I was going to buy a hot dog the other day. It was easier said than done. There were so many options to choose from: the type of sausage, size, how it should be prepared, type of bread, which toppings I wanted…
Finally, I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll have an original.&quot;
It&#x27;s nice to have freedom of choice and options, but sometimes it feels more like an obstacle than an opportunity. Soon, you&#x27;ll have to fire up AI to be able to buy milk.
When it comes to my work on the Bearming theme for Bear, it&#x27;s the exact opposite—and it feels very liberating.
Since there are limitations to what can be achieved in terms of underlying markup, there aren&#x27;t many possibilities left when it comes to styling. You have to compromise and think outside the box. Also, since the theme is intended for the general public, you have to try to accomplish everything without getting too technical. It’s challenging, rewarding, and fun at the same time.
Does this mean I’d rather live in a world where everyone&#x27;s got the same boring cereal? No, of course not. I&#x27;ll take a little FOMO over waiting in line for a Trabant any day.
I think, however, that it can be useful to consciously limit ourselves somewhat in this world of possibilities. Maybe we don&#x27;t need five streaming services—at least not at the same time? Maybe it&#x27;s enough if we limit our social media accounts to one or two?
A great number of our decisions are not really our own but are suggested to us from the outside; we have succeeded in persuading ourselves that it is we who have made the decision, whereas we have actually conformed with the expectations of others, driven by the fear of isolation and by more direct threats to our life, freedom, and comfort.
Written almost a hundred years ago by social psychologist and ”FOMO guru” Erich Fromm. It makes you think, and that’s one of the positive aspects of not being too limited.</span>

                              <span>+ On Friday, Aysenur Eygi, a 26-year-old American peace activist, was shot in the head and killed by an Israeli sniper during a demonstration against illegal settlements and land seizures in the West Bank village of Beita, near the city of Nablus. Eygi was taken to Rafida Hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.  […]

                              <span>I sometimes wonder about whether the decline in IT worker quality is down to companies trying to force more and more roles onto each worker to reduce headcount.
Developers, Operations, and Security used to be dedicated roles.
Then we made DevOps and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 2/3 of the headcount, rather than integrating those teams.
Then we made DevSecOps, and some businesses took that to mean they only needed 1/3 the original roles, and that devs could just also be their operations and appsec team.
That&#x27;s not a knock on shift-left and integrated operations models; those are often good ideas. It&#x27;s just the logical outcome of those models when execs think they can get a bigger bonus by cutting costs by cutting headcounts.
Now you have new devs coming into insanely complex n-microservice environments, being asked to learn the existing codebase, being asked to learn their 5-tool CI/CD pipelines (and that ain&#x27;t being taught in school), being asked to learn to be DBAs, and also to keep up a steady code release cycle.
Is anyone really surprised they are using ChatGPT to keep up?
This is going to keep happening until IT companies stop cutting headcounts to make line go up (instead of good business strategy).</span>

                              <span>I wonder if the study includes the technical debt that more experienced developers had to tackle after the less experienced devs have contributed their AI-driven efforts. Because my personal experience has involved a lot of that in one of the companies listed in the study.
Also, I&#x27;ve personally seen more interest in AI in devs that have little interest in technology, but a big interest in delivering. PMs love them though.</span>

I&#x27;m ok. I&#x27;m hopeful for the future. I believe there&#x27;s lots of amazing stuff we can do and that Exercism has a great future. But right now it&#x27;s in a hard, low place.

In two decades of crawling through most of the declassified public nuclear material from the US nuclear weapons program, some exposure to classified material, and numerous hours of interviews with working and retired nuclear scientists he believes it&#x27;s the single most detailed schematic of an actual specific type of warhead he&#x27;s seen so far.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wellerstein
As he&#x27;s blogging about this it&#x27;s almost certain he has had real current working nuclear weapons experts from his contact list read the advances and not disagree.
Correct or not, it&#x27;s not a casual random thought from someone with no exposure to such diagrams.</span>

                              <span>This is one of the saddest posts I&#x27;ve read in a long time.
I love exercism. It&#x27;s beautiful, works in the browser and from CLI. The lessons are really well designed. It&#x27;s the perfect coding school environment.
So, I&#x27;m sad it isn&#x27;t viable.
But, I think I am really saddened by the comments here, second guessing all the decisions they made. If I were to second guess the people behind most of the comments, I would assume no one has ever run a business with payroll, or built something with this much reach. The comments ring really hollow for the most part and seem really callous given this person has sunk his life into making the world, and my life, a better place. I&#x27;m scared for the moment he is in life and sad there are not more positive comments, and even better, comments from people where they would actually help by making a donation.</span>

It was already enough that entering people’s home increasingly meant being comfortable with Alexa and others, or that being in public meant you could either be in the background or the unkowing main topic of some TikTok video. I guess we are now increasingly entering an era where being outside means being filmed by a private person’s camera somewhere, or that you’ll even be recorded while visiting someone inside their home.
Now, I will say, I feel sympathy for the people using these in genuinely rough areas, or having survived some horrible break-ins. It hasn’t ever happened to me, bu…</span>

                              <span>Ironically, my answer is blogging.
I’ve abandoned four blogs this year, none lasting more than 60 days. My problem hasn’t been building the sites; it’s with my comfort level writing in public.
Things have improved recently. I’ve posted 11 days in a row. I’m determined to push past this awkward stage and find my voice.
The more you practice, the easier it gets.
I stopped trying to be perfect. I don&#x27;t have to write an essay. If it&#x27;s a short post, that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s no word count requirement. As long as I publish something, it&#x27;s a win!
Show up each day and give it your best shot. How else could you expect to improve?
If you&#x27;re a new blogger who can relate to this struggle, I hope this post encourages you. Don’t stress over clicking publish. Just share your honest thoughts. We want to hear your story.

                              <span>I use a lot of emojis when I write (especially chat), and it has always struck me as interesting that most people around me don’t. “Don’t they want to convey how they feel about this?” I ask myself. So much so that, for a long time, I thought my overuse of emojis came from a needy, co-dependent part of me that wanted to be pleasant to others and avoid any misunderstandings by being extra clear that I wasn’t angry or displeased with them through the use of the smiley face.
It wasn’t until quite recently that I realized my use of emojis was not “a weak front” (as is usually viewed by the professional and academic worlds), though it is neither a strength. What is it then? Well, it’s just an extra set of punctuation marks.
Emojis have drastically evolved since their first (genius) inception an…</span>

                              <span>My wife and I knew within a week of seeing each other that we would eventually get married. I had an adjustment to make though. In all my previous relationships, I&#x27;d been the biggest breadwinner in the family. This time that wouldn&#x27;t be the case. I was a public-school employee, and she was a partner in the most prestigious accounting firm in the area, earning about triple my salary. As life struggles go, making that mental adjustment wasn&#x27;t remarkably hard, but it did require me to reexamine myself, never a bad thing. I let go of the ego boost that earning a bigger wage gave me in the past and haven&#x27;t really thought about it much since then. We&#x27;ve never had an argument over money, even if she, with her accountant&#x27;s attention to detail, knows and often mentions the bank transactions I creat…</span>

Afterwards the Democrats seemed ecstatic that a little genocide didn’t disrupt their joy. But there were still plenty of protests and signs of divisions that could pose problems with Harris’s path to election especially as student protesters look to reinvigorate the movement. More

                              <span>This entire piece starts from the conclusion that engineers leave because they aren&#x27;t paid enough then works backwards from there. This is wrong from my experience. Anecdotally, I have never left a job because of money. Sure, I left jobs and got ones that ended up paying more money but the reason I started looking in the first place wasn&#x27;t money. It was for other reasons that usually included frustrations with management.</span>

                              <span>You do it during work hours. Period.
Your brain only has so many truly &#x27;on&#x27; hours in a day, and it&#x27;s already less than 8.  Trying to burn even more in the pursuit of complex knowledge isn&#x27;t just robbing Peter to pay Paul, it&#x27;s eating the seed corn and wondering why your harvest failed.
It&#x27;s a scary thing to realize, and can be hard to stick with.  But limits are real, and respecting them gets more work done in the long run than not.</span>

                              <span>Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30&#x27;s) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.
I just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other&#x27;s people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn&#x27;t out to impress anybody, I just became &quot;Mr. Dependable&quot; on any of the teams I worked on.
This was the approach that changed everything.
Now, some ten years later? I&#x27;m never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that&#x27;s it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.
I found out that if you don&#x27;t protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You&#x27;ll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.
Protect yourself. Protect your sanity. Once you lose it, like OP said, it&#x27;s very, very hard to get back.
I hope this helps someone else struggling to break this cycle.</span>

As a counterpoint, I have been running my own E-mail server for the last 25 years or so, and haven&#x27;t found it to be terribly problematic. Yes, there is an occasional issue, but I&#x27;d rather control my mail, than hand it off to someone else.</span>

                              <span>I disagree with this assessment on  many levels, but I think the most important challenge I can make is to the idea that Brewster Kahle is a rogue actor, who in some sense mis-interpreted the mission and strategy of the Internet Archive.
For those of you who are just learning that name from this lawsuit, here&#x27;s his wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle
Kahle founded the Archive in the nineties, in the midst of the fairly determined attempts at that time to either delay or even re-engineer the early Internet to be more respectful of existing intellectual property and decency laws.
We inherit a searchable, saveable web, because of the work done then to establish the norm that the Internet itself should exist, and that open digital archives can exist, legally. Many many…</span>

                              <span>I just got back from getting my hair lopped at Mastercuts. $30. And let me tell you, this lady got it right, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a small fortune.
I stopped and got a cream cheese and lox bagel with a blood orange Pelligrino around the corner from the salon. I sat by the window, and people watched, hurrying to and from their office jobs high in the sky.
The bagel was alright, although I think I got spoiled living at Bathurst and Lawrence, a predominantly Jewish community, with their spectacular bagels, that now, every other bagel shop, pales in comparison. My people know how to make a mean cream cheese and lox.
I&#x27;ve been up to my neck in job search.
There&#x27;s one in particular I&#x27;m hoping will call back. Not because I like the job, but because it&#x27;s close to home, and i can do the job with my eyes closed.

I&#x27;m still spending most of my writing efforts on my email blog.
I wrote two letters: end of august diary, and deep affection. Hope you liked them &lt;3

This past week, I&#x27;ve been trying out Substack. I know, I know, a lot of you don&#x27;t like the platform for various reasons. I&#x27;m with you on quite a few of them.
But. BUT. What a pleasure it is to write in their editor. Things WORK! Can you even imagine?
There are no weird formatting issues. I can easily upload a picture and write a caption easy peasy. Bullet lists don&#x27;t go all wonky when i hit publish.
But on the flip side, it doesn&#x27;t feel like my writing home. The writers use the same writerly language, discussing Important Things in highly sophisticated, educated, long-form essays.
I feel like the outcast in the cafeteria sitting by myself eating a wet sandwich my mom made me.

here more than even I anticipated, I&#x27;m very much looking forward to
being home. In a moment which I recognize as an incredibly rare
occurrence in my life, I want to be both places.
Like most people in the States after I turned eighteen I started
splitting time between home and school, or work, or wherever I
happened to be at the time. At first I didn&#x27;t go home very often
because I felt stagnant there, lost, and my parents&#x27; presence
exhausted me. I found ways to leave school days later than everyone
else and ways to return early from break. Most years I think I wanted
to be only in one place, if that — where I was — and in lower points
of my life I wanted to be neither where I was nor at home. So it is

                              <span>I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.
I feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.
I mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.
There was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.
I missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.
So here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.
Side note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?

                              <span>The rapid rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically change the labor market, and indeed possibly even the nature of work itself. However, how firms are adjusting their workforces to accommodate this emerging technology is not yet clear. Our August regional business surveys asked manufacturing and service firms special topical questions about their use of AI, and how it is changing their workforces. Most firms that report expected AI use in the next six months plan to retrain their workforces, with far fewer reporting adjustments to planned headcounts.</span>

                              <span>Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?</span>

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)
