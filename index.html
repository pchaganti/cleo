                              <span>You may have noticed a proliferation of a new essayist archetype on the internet in recent years - the &quot;Mini Navals.&quot; Modeled after angel investor, entrepreneur, and philosopher Naval Ravikant, these mini me&#x27;s desperately want to become the next big thought leader by aping Naval&#x27;s pithy, maxim-filled style. Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress &quot;wisdom&quot; into a handful of tweets and blog posts.
Most Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval&#x27;s entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it&#x27;s usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.
Sometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don&#x27;t need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.</span>

Humans are social creatures, and we receive a lot of information about the world when we gossip - it isn&#x27;t (necessarily) a bad thing.
Evolution
Gossip is in our blood. Humans who shared information among social circles had an evolutionary advantage. They were able to find those among the group they could trust, and (more importantly) identify bad actors. At the most basic level, gossip was a tool for survival. It answered important questions that helped the group function:
Who wields the most power/influence in the group? (alliances to make)
Who has limited resources? (alliances to avoid)
Whose sleeping with who…</span>

                              <span>Some photographs from the Chinese city of 沈阳 (Shenyang).

I could spend all day browsing these five-story malls. This one boasted restaurants, cafes, daycares, basketball courts, go-karting, and live fish.

Fine dining in 沈阳. These are the food models in the lobby. My mom fighting with my aunt and uncle-in-law to first pay the bill, and when she loses that battle, to order fewer items. Lots of 客气 to go around. 

Although it may look the part, those flowers are not lavender. You can&#x27;t see it here, but the whole time we were in Shenyang it looked as though it were snowing. I later learned that the &quot;snow&quot; was actually the seed hairs of the willow and the poplar trees. It looks cool until the fuzz gets in your eyes, on your clothes, everywhere. (source)
老北市
A popular night market in 沈阳 which runs every night. If you&#x27;re there at the right time, you can catch the show with flying drone-powered phoenixes shooting fireworks from their wings. Sadly I don&#x27;t have any good photos of that show — my senses were overwhelmed for most of the night (in a good way).










Night markets have been ruined for me forever. How can anything measure up to that? Not to mention we passed two markets en route to 老北市 that also looked better than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.</span>

                              <span>The term skill issue is thrown around Twitter a lot. It comes from gaming culture. If you can&#x27;t beat a level. It is a skill issue. Just level up and win. If you think about it, it is a powerful term. It gives power to the player.
Applied to life everything is a skill issue. Can&#x27;t do the perfect juggle? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t write awesome distributed performant code? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t convince a penguin to try your awesome new ice cream? You guessed it. Skill issue. It is a powerful mindset. Gives you extreme ownership.
But there is a catch. Do you take ownership of other people&#x27;s shitty behavior? No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don&#x27;t need the negativity in your life.
Here the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context. In a more personal context, things are a lot more messy. I don&#x27;t have an answer for that which works. A skill issue on my end. Need more life experience to resolve it.
Make everything a skill issue and just level up!</span>

In a previous Liberty Street Economics post, we have shown that even relative to a group of comparable non-veterans, veterans have lower employment and labor force participation rates. One year later, we see that veterans continue to experience lower labor market attachment and the employment gap has widened, though the earnings gap has closed.</span>

                              <span>In the fall, I&#x27;ll be moving to a new city to pursue graduate studies. I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.
Next week I&#x27;m flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it&#x27;ll be just me, in a new city. I&#x27;m excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I&#x27;m really on my own.
I moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it&#x27;s time for me to leave; I&#x27;ve been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I&#x27;m in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).
It&#x27;s a big step, despite something I&#x27;m excited for. Yet very scary. But if I&#x27;m scared to do it, it&#x27;s exactly because I&#x27;m scared that I should do it.
I think I&#x27;m ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.
The (paper) journal I&#x27;ve kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It&#x27;s as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.
I&#x27;ll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?</span>

                              <span>You really shouldn&#x27;t have to write your own Anki cards today.
There&#x27;s a really common sentiment that using pre-made or llm generated decks can&#x27;t replace creating your own.
This is probably true. Writing your own flashcards forces you into a state where you have to actually think and organize the concepts together in your head into things that are digestible.
Often the flashcards that people create are not conducive to review. It&#x27;s hard to create cards that aren&#x27;t easy to remember the &quot;shape&quot; of later on instead of actually remembering the content. And drilling one small piece of the puzzle doesn&#x27;t fill in the rest of the pie.
LLMs are sophisticated enough now to generate variations on flashcards on-demand. But nobody has wired up LLMs natively with spaced repetition for learning. It seems like everyone has stopped at &quot;generate 100 flashcards for me based on this pdf,&quot; which does result in flashcards that aren&#x27;t going to help you remember things.</span>

                              <span>The fundamental selling point of all productivity advice is getting more done in less time. It&#x27;s a good hook. I have over the years consumed a lot of content around productivity. It took me a long time to realise I was making a fundamental mistake.
I assumed I would stumble upon some specific protocol that I can follow perfectly and my life is set. So I have tried it all. All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.
The fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.
This realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.
How to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming. I have given a framework I follow for this in my &#x27;Hacking Hardwork&#x27; post.
There is no golden technique that will save you. Only you can save yourself.</span>

                              <span>People that use mouth dildos annoy the shit out of me. Either commit and smoke a cigarette, or give it up.
I hate smoking. I think it&#x27;s fucking disgusting and I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to do it. I especially hate it when there&#x27;s a gaggle of smokers huddled around the front door of a pub, tooting away on their fags. It&#x27;s vile and I don&#x27;t want my pink fluffy lungs affected by that shit.
But do you know what I hate more than smoking?
Mouth dildos.
What the fuck is a mouth dildo?
-- Everyone
This is a mouth dildo:

Not only do you look ridiculous putting that stupid fucking contraption in your mouth, but the plumes of flavoured vapour that bellow from these things make you look even more like an utter cunt.
I don&#x27;t want to be subjected to the cherry ice cream vapour pouring from your mouth dildos, seemingly by the bucket load. At least smokers are committing, knowing they&#x27;re gonna kill themselves, have decided to enjoy it while they&#x27;re here.
But you mouth dildo fuckers are the worst. We don&#x27;t want to smell your stupid fucking vape. So put it away because you look (and smell) like a dick head.
Peace ✌🏻

 I wrote about how difficult it was to get from Kyiv to Lviv on the first day of a full-scale war in the novel THE MINING BOYS. But when I finally got there, it only got worse. 
 The people who sheltered me sincerely did not understand why I did not want to defend the country with weapons in my hands. My hope to go to Europe seemed like a betrayal to them. At the same time, I had to hide from them not only my fear, but also my culture and my orientation. 
 These same people advised me to voluntarily join the territorial defense. Their acquaintances, who also didn’t want to fight, deliberately signed up there so they wouldn…</span>

                              <span>Back in the glory days of the internet, when social media was just becoming mainstream, I used to blog regularly. I would write and publish a post anywhere from 1 - 3 times a week.
I didn&#x27;t monetize my blog and I had no dreams of my personal site becoming a business. It was simply a place for me to share things that were on my mind and lessons learned from books I was reading.
Fast forward many years and what we have is the current state of the internet.
Everything is an ad. Everyone is an influencer. And the algorithms determine what we see and dictate what we post. And for some reason they insist on the entire population becoming video producers.
It&#x27;s an endless game that I lost my taste for long ago.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m attempting to blog again. I need somewhere to get my thoughts and opinions out without distraction and without too much tech.
If the internet stresses you out as much as it does me, might I suggest starting your own blog?
Or heck, maybe just quit the social internet altogether.</span>

                              <span>A direita, os anarcocapitalistas (embora este termo seja discutível) e a extrema-direita brasileira, diante do crime ambiental praticado no Rio Grande do Sul, conseguiram emplacar uma bela história: o povo pelo povo.
É muito importante salientar como o povo brasileiro se uniu para ajudar o povo do Rio Grande do Sul. É reconfortante observar que o próprio povo, especialmente os mais pobres, uniu-se no próprio RS para ajudar os outros. Voluntários que não têm muito em casa saem às 5h para atender 12h em um abrigo onde as pessoas perderam tudo. Isso é significativo, especialmente após o período de 2018 a 2023, em que o Brasil parecia uma poça de sangue (e ainda parece, em certa medida), pois mostra que o povo ainda é solidário, mesmo que precise de uma tragédia para uni-los.
O problema é que …</span>

                              <span>Supply chain disruptions became a major headache for businesses in the aftermath of the pandemic. Indeed, in October 2021, nearly all firms in our regional business surveys reported at least some difficulty obtaining the supplies they needed. These supply chain disruptions were a key contributor to the surge in inflation that occurred as the economy recovered from the pandemic recession. In this post, we present new measures of supply availability from our Business Leaders Survey and Empire State Manufacturing Survey that closely track the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI). We will begin publishing these data on a monthly basis starting in June. These indexes indicate that supply availability had generally been improving since early 2023, but over the past couple of months, improvement has stalled. This trend is concerning since our May Supplemental Survey indicates that between a third and a half of businesses in the region are experiencing difficulties obtaining supplies, and many are reducing operations and raising prices to compensate, though to a lesser extent than a few years ago.</span>

 Following many years of hidden and small-scale resistance, African slaves in the French colony of Saint Domingue (or San Domingo) rose up in 1791 against their colonizers and slave masters. By 1804, they abolished slavery, expelled the French colonizers, and established the independent republic of Haiti. Haiti was the name given to the Caribbean island by the Tainos before colonizers arrived, slaughtered the entire indigenous population, and imported African slaves. 
 While the 1776 and 1789 revolutions of the USA and France were grounded in exclusionary “citizens’ rights,” the Haitian Revolution stood out for a com…</span>

                              <span>Since as early as Kubernetes v1.7, the Kubernetes project has pursued the ambitious goal of removing built-in cloud provider integrations (KEP-2395).
While these integrations were instrumental in Kubernetes&#x27; early development and growth, their removal was driven by two key factors:
the growing complexity of maintaining native support for every cloud provider across millions of lines of Go code, and the desire to establish
Kubernetes as a truly vendor-neutral platform.
After many releases, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce that all cloud provider integrations have been successfully migrated from the core Kubernetes repository to external plugins.
In addition to achieving our initial objectives, we&#x27;ve also significantly streamlined Kubernetes by removing roughly 1.5 million lines of code and reduci…</span>

Here we go.
Hi, I&#x27;m Meï ! And welcome to this blog. Or this attempt at a blog.
It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I felt a lot of nostalgia for the Internet of old, the one I discovered as a lil&#x27; kid, on my tenth birthday, circa 2007.
A friend, Seeker, began working on his own blog a few months back. I really liked his articles about DIY and Game Dev, and on a whim asked him his tech stack with the intent of setting something up for myself.
I used to write quite a bit a few years ago. Especially when I got to the big city after high school. Welcome to Fucktopia1 was a small series detailing my new life far from the countryside.
As of late, I&#x27;ve been trying to get back into writing. Essays to recommend some games, some small fictions, and lore for TTRPGs, I&#x27;ve been slowly but surely getting back into it. But I didn&#x27;t really manage to find a public, even for the essays in places (well, Discord servers in this case) dedicated to the exact IP I was trying to promote.
This built up as a bit of frustration, and is another of the reasons I felt like doing a blog. I wanted to be more open to the world, able to write in a place anyone could read if they stumble on the place.
So once again, here we go!
1. As a note, the &quot;Fucktopia&quot; is a reference to Souillon&#x27;s comic book &quot;Hello Fucktopia&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t find a listing in English, sorry! It&#x27;s available in French &amp; Spanish, at least..
My small rules of writing
Try to write regularly. Not necessarily everyday, but I should strive for a post per week at least.
Focus! I&#x27;m super prone to tangents and often stray off-topic. A post should be on a single subject, unless this is a post consciously made for tangents and chaos.
No stressing over this. I already stress over too much, let&#x27;s keep this place as my comfy Internet place.
Let&#x27;s hope it goes well. And I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this blog and its topics.

                              <span>A bear in a circus is interesting. So is a juggler and a man on the unicycle. A bear on a unicycle juggling swords on the other hand is something extremely unique. Something you would pay good money to see. A smart generalist is kinda like that.
A smart generalist is a person who is 80/20 across multiple fields. This means they have reached 80 Percent understanding/capability across multiple fields leveraging around 20 percent of the effort that would typically be needed to fully master it. It makes them unique.
The primary skill of a smart generalist is the ability to get from 0 to 80 in a new field quickly. They can quickly identify high ROI leverage points of a subject. It is a learned skill. They also have strong convictions that anything can be learned and learned fast. Even things considered &#x27;tough&#x27; by society.
On the other hand, we have the cracked specialists. People really good at one thing. Getting to the frontiers and advancing human knowledge. Creating absolutely beautiful works in that &#x27;one thing&#x27;.
It is a sliding scale. We all lie somewhere between a specialist and a generalist. But we could all do some good to realise we are not limited. We can do multiple things if we want to. It is easy to be hemmed in. To define your identity as &#x27;Software Engineer&#x27; or &#x27;Writer&#x27; or &#x27;XYZ&#x27;. That is what school teaches -&#x27;Specialisation&#x27;. But humans are versatile. We are the OG general intelligence. Capable of adapting and doing multiple things.
Don&#x27;t forget the &#x27;General&#x27; in General Intelligence.</span>
