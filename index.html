 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…</span>

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…</span>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…</span>

These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.</span>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is neither a great orator, nor did his speech before a joint Congressional session on July 24 have actual worth. It was an expression of his desperation, if not defeat, on all fronts.
This is not new. For years, Netanyahu has served the role of a social media meme. During his United Nations General Assembly speech in September 2012, the Israeli leader displayed a bomb diagram to fan the flames for another Middle East war. More

That, says Nadav Weiman, is driven in large part by the rhetoric constantly fed to them, and in particular, the use of the term ‘Amalek’.

                              <span>By now everyone who could be recruited by the “Beat Trump” message has been recruited. People who fear the autocracy and unhinged “leadership” Trump offers need to recruit to our ranks the uncommitteds and those who don’t trust the Establishment. To accomplish that, I believe three messages should characterize the upcoming campaign. Everyone can help  More

                              <span>Hacker News, thank you for all the links and all the great reading. Now I have to say goodbye.
I’m with my wife Bess (https://bessstillman.substack.com/) and my brother Sam, and crying, but it is okay. At the end of Lord of the Rings Gandalf says to the hobbits, &quot;Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.” And that is how I feel now. Ending prematurely hurts, but all things must end, and my time to end is upon me.</span>

Never have I tested anything and NOT found a bug, and most things I tested I thought were already OK to ship.
Thus, when you delete your tests, the only person you are fooling is probably yourself :(
From reading your page I get the impression you are more burnt out from variation/configuration management which is completely relatable… I am too. This is a hard problem. But user volume is required to make $$. If the problem was easy then the market would be saturated with one size fits all solutions for everything.</span>

More seriously the solution suggested of giving the 3 companies other unused prefixes like D* U* and A* to use with their codeshares and non rev flights to start seems the easiest.</span>

&gt; I used this project as an opportunity to learn about Rust and FUSE file systems. I also think it&#x27;s hilarious.
&gt; Visitors interested in the code should note that this is 
 an irredeemably messy codebase—it&#x27;s full of hacks, unidiomatic code, and wildly poor design decisions.
&gt; However, visitors should also 
note that that&#x27;s okay. The 
best way to learn something 
new is to try it out for 
yourself—and creating a mess 
is a vital part of that 
process.
I absolutely love this sentiment. Why do this? Because it’s fun. And messy. And sometimes, that’s okay. Not everything needs to be a product… sometimes it’s enough to do something because you can… or want to… or because $RANDOM reason. I’m very grateful to the author and whoever decided to submit it today.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Everyone knew there were introverts and extroverts, homebodies and socialites, but it had never really mattered. The two groups complemented each other and managed to peacefully cohabit.
What a very extroverted perspective. &quot;Everything was fine when the world was structured around an extroverted lifestyle. Then the pandemic hit and everything was miserable for a bit, but what&#x27;s even worse is that those darn introverts aren&#x27;t happy resuming their natural place in society!&quot;
The pandemic gave us a taste of what life could be like if the world were structured around our preferred way of existing instead of yours. It turns out we liked it, and now that we&#x27;ve had that taste we&#x27;re not comfortable resuming the old status quo where we just tag along for the ride in an extroverted world.
It boggles my mind that someone can write an article like this and not realize that what they&#x27;re saying is they wish a group of people would go back to being an underclass.</span>

I think it&#x27;s good that the status quo got mixed up a bit. The introverts don&#x27;t have to defend themselves or feel like outsiders quite so much.
This article aligns stay-at-home-ness with &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;a fettered life,&quot; &quot;hardly worth living&quot; and says &quot;retreating ... is an ultimately selfish choice.&quot; I believe that&#x27;s a bit of a poor take. Plenty of people live rich, productive, fulfilling and engaged lives that don&#x27;t especially involve a lot of interactions with other people.
This author is clearly someone whose habits were impinged by the changes brought on by the pandemic (&quot;... naturally outgoing people – this writer included – have found it that bit harder to get their friends out of the house.&quot;), but is that the end of the world?
It almost feels like the author is eager to get back to what they are comfortable with, at the expense of (by their numbers) 1/3 of other people&#x27;s lifestyles. It&#x27;s almost like they are the ones afraid of this change — like they are the selfish ones.
But I don&#x27;t really go for the whole us-vs-them approach at all. It has been a great (if forced) learning experience. Some people got to discover happiness they didn&#x27;t know before. Other people felt the loss of something they took for granted. Perhaps we should share these lessons with each other and bring some balance and increased awareness, rather than pointing fingers and taking sides.</span>

Her new book, The Echoes, looks like it will follow suit, given it incorporates elements of The Bass Rock, including settings across several locations and time, and a dollop […]</span>

                              <span>In my first Blaugust post, I insinuated that I had a plan on how I’m going to tackle this month’s blogging challenge.
I&#x27;ll make a plan (of some sort) of how I&#x27;m going to tackle this at some point.
The truth is, my plan going into this is to not have a plan.
I joined the IndieWeb blogging community at the very tail end of March. In April, I joined a daily photo challenge hosted by Micro.blog. It was my very first challenge and had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed posting a photo a day alongside a community based on a specific prompt. I felt that sort of camraderie feeling amongst a blogging community I haven’t felt in a very long time.
That one was easy. I didn’t stress out about it because photos tend to come easier to me than words. I had a collection of photos I could dig into to meet t…</span>

                              <span>I came across this concept reading a book with the same name as the title of this post. The author makes the argument that we have been led astray by the passion hypothesis. Passion is fickle and hard to define in some cases. What we really want is freedom and autonomy in the work we do. A sense of ownership and a feeling of contribution.
But there is no free lunch. You want rainbows and unicorns at work but what do you bring in exchange? You bring a skillset. Something you are so godamn good in that they can&#x27;t help but hire you. Can&#x27;t help but give you freedom, autonomy, and ownership. The ability to set your own hours and work on the things you like.
This is even more relevant when you are building a product. The typical indie hacking advice is to iterate fast and throw a bunch of things at the wall. See what sticks. Probably good advice to make some money but always felt like a pussy move to me. What you make is determined by the whims and fancies of the initial audience.
What happened to being that intense &#x27;Steve Job&#x27; type of founder? YOU believe in the product with such fervor that DAMN the market. They will buy it and they will like it. You have a vision. And the habits of the people and the market will change to serve it.
It goes beyond just being so good that you cannot be ignored. No. This is a different level. You don&#x27;t just move through the world, the world moves to accommodate your passing.</span>

                              <span>The summer term is over! I&#x27;m back in my hometown, bothering my dogs and following my grandmother around the house like a little kid. I was hoping to get 100s all around this term, but I messed up one arts assignment, so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to settle for almost there. I&#x27;ll need all the tiny boosts I can get from electives if I want to graduate on time and with honors in two years. Agh.
School aside, there&#x27;s nothing much to write about today. The sky&#x27;s been cloudy but bright the whole day, like the sun is playing hide-and-seek with the intention of being found. I ate banana bread and another unidentified sweet bread someone brought back from a trip. The banana bread was okay, but the other one (milk? Butter? Just normal sugary bread?) was really good. Thank God for bread.
I&#x27;m starting and abandoning so many new posts. I couldn&#x27;t settle on any of them, so I decided to do this one instead. Hope you had some good bread in your life today!</span>

Oh okay! I didn&#x27;t think about it that way! I&#x27;m so silly 🤪
For real though, one of the things about getting older is caring less about what people think. I used to think my dad looked so lame wearing 10 year old, $7 jeans from Walmart, generic black tennis shoes and a plain solid color tee shirt all the time like he&#x27;s some kinda Seinfeld character. Meanwhile I was straightening my blonde emo-ver hair, wearing skin tight skinny jeans with a pink studded belt from Spencer&#x27;s and walking around in loud, multicolor, just... massive tongued skating shoes.
These days, half the time I&#x27;m at work anyway so I&#x27;m wearing a long-sleev…</span>

                              <span>Astonishingly, It took a long time for revision control to become widespread.
Around 1991 when Cygnus had 6-7 employees and was based in the apartment complex where I lived, none of the GNU codebase was hosted in any sort of revision control.  Everything was FTPed around as obscurely named tarballs.  We had gathered something like 27 different forks of gdb floating around the net, for example.  This was back when forking was generally considered a tragedy, something I managed to change five or six years later).
Rich Pixley came and said “all of our code should be in revision control, and I want to use this newfangled thing called CVS.”  Michael was OK with it but John and I were steadfastly opposed.  We agreed to an experiment, grudgingly, subject to a whole whiteboard of absurd conditions (“must be transparently integrated into emacs so we don’t have to know it’s there).
Pixley agreed to all of that and then ignored all of it completely.  It was immediately such a win that everybody adopted it without complaint, including us two obstreperous a-holes.
A few years later a preventable crisis was how revision control first became client-server.</span>

                              <span>When I started at my first company, they had a very complex VB application running on dozens of customers around the country, each having some particular needs of course.
There was a LOT of global variables (seemingly random 4 uppercase letters) controlling everything.
At some point, the application had some bugs which were not appearing when the application was run in debug mode in Visual Studio. The solution was obvious: installing Visual Studio for each customer on site and teaching the users to run the app in debug mode from Visual Studio. I don&#x27;t know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done.
What happened next was even worse.
There was no version control of course, the code being available on a shared disk on the local network of the company with the code copied over in multiple folders each having its own version, with no particular logic to it either, V1, V2, V2.3, V2a, V2_customer_name, V2_customer_name_fix, ...
After that, when there was a problem for a customer, the programmer went there to debug and modified the code on site. If the bug/problem was impacting other customers, we had to dispatch some guys for each customer to go copy/edit the code for all of them. But if the problem was minor, it was just modified there, and probably saved on the shared folder in some new folder.
What happened next was to be expected: there was no consensus on what was the final version, each customer having slightly different versions, with some still having bugs fixed years before for others.</span>

                              <span>&gt; compiler writers refuse to take responsibility for the bugs they introduced, even though the compiled code worked fine before the &quot;optimizations&quot;. The excuse for not taking responsibility is that there are &quot;language standards&quot; saying that these bugs should be blamed on millions of programmers writing code that bumps into &quot;undefined behavior&quot;
But that&#x27;s not an excuse for having a bug; it&#x27;s the exact evidence that it&#x27;s not a bug at all. Calling the compiler buggy for not doing what you want when you commit Undefined Behavior is like calling dd buggy for destroying your data when you call it with the wrong arguments.</span>

                              <span>My worst codebase story:
In my first real job, I worked for a company that maintained a large legacy product programmed in a combination of COBOL and Java.
In order to work on the Java side of the product, you checked out individual files from source control to work on, which &#x27;locked&#x27; the files and prevented other developers from checking out the same files. This functionality was not part of our actual source control system, but was instead accomplished with a series of csh shell scripts you could run after ssh&#x27;ing into our development server.
Each of our customers had a &#x27;master&#x27; jar file that represented the actual final compiled product (a jar file is really a zip file archive, which bundles together the resulting compiled java class files).
Once you had finished implementing your code changes, you ran another set of scripts which found the master jar file for each customer, unzips it, copies the compiled files from your local machine into it, and zips it back up again. Finally the source control lock is released.
This means, effectively, that the codebase was never compiled as a whole at any point in the process, instead, we just manually patched the jar file over time with individually compiled class files.
Over the years, small errors in the process allowed a huge amount of inconsistencies to creep into the codebase. Race conditions would allow two developers to lock the same file at once, or a developer would change a class that was a dependency of some other code that somebody else was changing. Sometimes code changes would make it into some of the customer jar files, but not others. Nobody knew why.
It took a small team two years to migrate the entire codebase to git with proper CI, and a huge chunk of that time was reproducing a version of the codebase that actually compiled properly as a whole. After the project was finished, I resigned.</span>

                              <span>Today, I realized that the past three days share something important and beautiful: community.
Today, the pride parade took place here in Stockholm. I met up with my mom, sister, her husband, and their kids, who had come to the city for the occasion. It was wonderful sharing the event with them.
Yesterday, I decided to return to Mastodon. I missed the community and created a new account (birming@social.lol). Thank you all for the warm welcome. You&#x27;re amazing!
The day before yesterday, I decided to continue this blog. Since then, I&#x27;ve received wonderful feedback from you readers. It&#x27;s made me happy, grateful, and motivated. Thank you all!
Three days, three different experiences, but one common thread: community. It&#x27;s easy to overlook this invaluable aspect of life. However, when it&#x27;s absent, we truly understand its significance.
So, dear friends, thank you for being part of my life.</span>

The chilly morning winter air
Being able to admire beautiful sunrise and sunsets
The colourful sound of bird calls
The feeling of serenity when I have a glass of tea in the early hours of the morning
The peace I feel whenever I sit down to write a post
Moments spent with loved ones
Sleeping in on the weekends
Tasty food

                              <span>I&#x27;m Valentine. As you&#x27;ve probably already guessed, that is not my real name. I like my (semi-)anonymity. I may be spilling my guts on here, but I&#x27;d like to do it under the cover of a good old pseudonym.
Like a lot of people, I&#x27;ve been using different names online for years. Obviously not to commit crimes, but to make it less likely I become a victim of one. Also, I just like it. Names fascinate me: they make up such a big part of our first impressions. I&#x27;ve tried feminine names and not-so-feminine ones. I&#x27;ve never tried a really masculine name, though—I&#x27;ve always loved being a woman, online and offline, even if it comes with many inconveniences of varying sizes.
I took Valentine from the Måneskin song of the same name. But if that&#x27;s too somber for you, there&#x27;s also the Laufey song, which i…</span>

                              <span>V landed in New York this week. I met him and Mom at his new studio apartment1 with the keys, which puts an end to my weeks of apartment tours. (Thank Frith...)
I think we were all pretty happy to see each other. Things haven&#x27;t always been this way, so I&#x27;m grateful our relationships have improved as the years go by. One of the things I don&#x27;t think gets talked about enough is how important (and difficult!) the task of forgiving your parents is. Of course nothing will undo what we saw, felt, and heard as kids but (most of) our parents were just trying their best. Aren&#x27;t we all? I know I would want to be forgiven if I had tried my best, even if things didn&#x27;t come out exactly as I&#x27;d hoped.
Predictably, Mom hates New York. It doesn&#x27;t help that inexplicably, they chose a hotel a block away from …</span>

                              <span>I was supposed to do an Intro Post yesterday, but I’ve never been good at it so I delayed it until I could figure out what to say. Here we are a day later, and I still don’t quite have the words for it. I always fall back to a post I’ve written of not wanting to talk about myself as an explanation. Either way, I’ve come to realize that I never did do a proper introduction on this blog, outside of my About me page. In my defense, I think what I have written on there is enough to kind of get a gist for who I am.
But since I’m writing a post anyways, I figured I’d say something else that doesn’t completely repeat everything written on there.
Online, I typically go by JC(Probably), but most people in real life call me Jedda. You can tell a lot about how people know me, and from what moment in …</span>

                              <span>Being in my early 20s, there should be no surprise that I have grown up with and have extensively used social media platforms to socialise, communicate, and share ideas with other people. It is no secret that these platforms can and have caused harm to their user&#x27;s mental health (me included!), but even knowing this I&#x27;ve sat on my hands for years before actually taking action to remedy this situation.
However, as a lot of you know, it&#x27;s not easy to just drop social media cold turkey. In my opinion, I think there are a few main reasons why this is the case, and I will attempt to argue against each one in this post.
1. Social media is addictive

                              <span>I am very much a dog person. I am presently owned by two mini dachshunds.
Rolo, a five-year-old smooth-haired, chocolate and tan female is incredibly reactive. It makes her difficult to train and discipline, but I love her anyway. She came to me in 2019, a few months after my first dachshund passed away.
Finnegan is my long-haired dachshund mix baby. He’s currently nine months old and is a big snugglebug. His mother is a full mini dachshund, while his father is a mini Bichon. Finn is much, much less reactive than Rolo, thankfully. He was a 2023 Christmas gift from my parents (my mom owns his parents).
My dogs are my children. I say this as a woman who is unable to have kids. These little furballs are one of the biggest sources of joy in my life, offering unconditional love and comfort. A bad day can be fixed with a puppy kiss. Ask me how I know.
It’s quite amazing how they have such a large impact on my mental health. And after living with my own dogs since 2006, I’m not sure I could ever be without one again. They’re the best companions that someone like me could ever ask for.</span>

                              <span>I am tired of talking about J.D. Vance. And I’m not one for introspection (just ask my husband). But as a daughter of Appalachia and a professor of anthropology at a public university, J.D. Vance’s claim to represent Appalachia and his threats to attack our nation’s universities and their professors, who he’s labeled “the enemy,” are personal for me. Echoing other Appalachia-raised writers who have recently weighed in, I say to J.D. Vance: you are a hillbilly phony (Caleb Miller). You don’t represent us (Neema Avashia). And you can keep your “elegy” (Ivy Brashear) because hillbillies don’t need one (Meredith McCarroll). Your Hillbilly Elegy is a political platform disguised as a memoir, and I call bullshit. More

This is probably why he thought he could get away with saying he killed Massey in self-defense, as she was charging toward him with a pot of boiling water. What Grayson didn’t realize is that his partner’s body cam recorded the entire fatal encounter, showing that the diminutive, unarmed Massey was hiding from the Springfield deputy, when Grayson walked around the kitchen counter, shot her in the face and left her to bleed out. Then he lied about it…lies that were caught on tape and exposed as lies on tape. More

An upcoming anniversary should remind us of what sent us down this undemocratic path. More

                              <span>The findings of the original study were called into question by a larger 2018 study[0]. The original study had 90 students. Some folks did a study with 900 people. They found the same correlation that the original study did. But when they controlled for household income, they found most of the correlation disappeared.
The obvious conclusion is that household income is a predictor of both:
- inability to delay gratification, and
- higher academic achievement
This makes sense when you consider that someone growing up in a poor household may have both:
- less reliable/continuous/predictable access to material things, meaning they would rationally seize immediate opportunities rather than taking the risk of a larger future opportunity, and
- less academic support
Now, this new study (OP) goes even further, finding that the correlation itself is weak.

                              <span>One big change I&#x27;ve noticed between growing up in a small town and now where I&#x27;m in my mid 40s in a big metro city in India is increased &quot;transactional&quot; nature of interactions of my daily life.
Back then we had a deeper ties with all those who served us by which I mean vegetable vendor, carpenter, doctor, knife sharpener, cloth shop, grocer, baker and so on. Whenever we interacted with them it would be a small chit-chat, exchange small updates (how&#x27;s your son doing, is he married yet?) and then finally do the actual purchase.
It was to an extent that the carpenter would come by and just hand over a big dining table just because he thought our house deserved/needed it. He wouldn&#x27;t ask for immediate payment either and also in instalments. Some other times he would come by and borrow some money.
All of that is now gone. Every single interaction I have now with vendors is 100% transactional. I don&#x27;t even know their names nor they mine.
It means that I&#x27;m now connected only with my immediate family, that&#x27;s it. It also means that the generation now growing up know only transactional way of interaction with non family/friends. I guess these things eventually add up to the loss of community.</span>

                              <span>Well, yes, we&#x27;ve doubled down on mediating social interactions through economic relationships. Most of the interactions adults have in their lives are with or in the framing of economic relations. Homes, are being invaded with tablets and mobile devices which bring along with them framing interactions as economic relations through ad and consumer frames. Workplaces are inherently settings of economic relations, and third places outside of the consumer setting are becoming extinct because they are non-monetizable.
This last category, non-consumer third places are formerly the domain of kid-friendly community-building activities. When we talk about creating more of these and the response is, &quot;they aren&#x27;t economically viable,&quot; it&#x27;s exactly the kind of economic calculus framing that I&#x27;m talking about.</span>

If you are Black, trans/queer, and operating in good faith, feel free to highlight passages you would like to learn more about. Medium allows authors to interact with their readers.

 The ghost of Turgenev crying 
 “Enough!” 
 Is in my ears 
 My activities are glorious 
 While several seasons 
 Fighting disease 
 Living closely with personal existential uncertainty 
 My body is marked 
 There is a thin line 
 Across my left eyelid 
 A scar from where it was removed 
 I am tired of this 
 There is a book 
 Being written 
 The first section poems like this 
 I wonder if it’s my last 
 I don’t know

 All things are possible 
 So say Shestov and Fondane 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 Including the impossibility 
 Of my writing another book after this 
 Yes, all things are possible 
 What is most possible though 
 For all life 
 It seems is i…</span>

It Doesn’t Have to Be This Way, You Know
 There is a beauty that creeps in under the plastic blinds, covering the window, in the form of sunlight. A beauty that seems an attempt by the world outside to draw some contrast to the words I write here, and that you will read later on. That for all the expression of pain, and dissatisfaction, and desire for more, there is still beauty to be found here, bouncing around the walls of this mold infested apartment.

A Few Words From the Distro
 Riding freight is a core skill for anti-work, anti-school, individualist anarchists, lifestylists, nomads, oogles, crust punk dirty kids, and travelers. 
 Hate your job? Quit and go train hopping! 
 Sick of school? Drop out and go train hopping! 
 Feeling suicidal with no fun and excitement in your life? 
 Try something new, open a new chapter and go train hopping! 
 But train hopping is very dangerous! You SERIOUSLY could die. 
 But you could also die in a car wreck on the way to work, or die from getting shot to death by a mass shooter.

PREFACE
 Welcome to the collective book on collective process! Over the course of the twenty or so years that AK Press has been publishing and distributing anarchist and radical literature, we&#x27;ve gotten a lot of requests for good, short overviews of topics that are of interest to the folks in our communities: anarchism, worker&#x27;s rights, solidarity economics, and countless other things. We do our best to seek out books to publish or distribute that meet our readers’ needs, but it can take a while to find exactly the right author or book.

 The formation of Buddhist socialism in Japan made a belated start and its influence was little compared with that of Christian socialism in Europe, or even with the revolutionary movement (1851-1864) which occurred in the period of “idle peace” started by Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全) in China. The reason for the belated start seems to be indirectly concerned with national isolationism and the slow development of capitalism in Japan. The Communist Manifesto was published 20 years before the Meiji Restoration and the first volume of Das Kapital was issued a year before the Meiji Restoration. Directly…</span>

 In the West, it is practically impossible to speak publicly about Hamas in any way that isn&#x27;t an outright and total condemnation. Behind such remarkable limitation of the spectrum of public debate lies the idea that Hamas represents an &quot;evil&quot; so deep that it lacks any complexity. In parliaments, universities and newspapers, Hamas is never discussed, simply because -- it is assumed -- there is nothing to discuss. The idea that Hamas is simply a &quot;terrorist&quot; group that wants nothing but dea…</span>

                              <span>Thank you, rsc, for all your work.  Development in Go has become much more enjoyable in these 12 years: race detector, standardized error wrapping, modules, generics, toolchain updates, and so on.  And while there are still things to be desired (sum types, better enum/range types, immutability, and non-nilness in my personal wishlist), Go is still the most enjoyable ecosystem I&#x27;ve ever developed in.</span>

                              <span>So I laser weld, and beyond my own PPE, interlocks (gun won&#x27;t fire if it&#x27;s not touching metal, etc), the most important part of the whole setup is laser safety curtains.
Because it&#x27;s a 2500 watt laser, if i didn&#x27;t have laser safety curtains , the relections/etc could very easily blind someone at a fairly long distance.
The NOHD (nominal ocular hazard distance) is something like 10km (2500 watt laser, 0.06mm spot size, divergence is very very small).  The actual hazard distance is shorter, but still, kinda crazy.
(as for why i have a laser welder - i got it cheap and besides the downsides above, it is very easy to weld ~anything without much skill.  A person who has never welded in their life can weld sheet metal and have it come out basically perfect in 5 minutes)</span>

look at youtube
there&#x27;s the side where someone is always selling something
there&#x27;s the side where a grandma is sharing her recipe
there&#x27;s the side where someone just posted a video compilation of their dead love one
there&#x27;s the side where someone is laughing with their friends
earlier this year, i was complaining that my feed was full of people selling me something
but your social media feed doesn&#x27;t operate in a vacuum. it shows you more of what you look for
i wanted to sell something, so i was looking for people to teach me to sell something, so i was only being recommended videos of people teaching me to sell something
i don&#x27;t like that side of the internet
so i left it
you can leave the side you&#x27;re on and join another

                              <span>From the same trip where I took the photo of Nemo in El Nido, Philippines.

August 2014, Philippines, GoPro Hero 3
Not a huge fan of how I edited this. It&#x27;s too high-def for my taste now, but this is why I like posting these throwback photos because I get to see how my post-processing preferences have changed over the years. The sky is a bit blown out as well, but that may also be due to the original photo (that I don&#x27;t have access to at the moment).</span>

                              <span>Why write?
I have a ritual. Every time I set out to do something new, be it a new habit, a new course, or a new adventure in life, I ask myself, why? This exercise in setting a purpose is essential because it stays as a reminder of your initial vision about what you set out to do. So, as I launch this blog, I want to openly share the purpose and vision behind it.
This isn&#x27;t just another hobby project for me. Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to write. To share my ideas with friends, aka people, across the world. There was even a time when I wanted to try to write a self help book, to understand the world and life in general, more effectively. I have always been enamoured by great ideas. For it is these great ideas, passed down from generation to generation, which have survived the test of…</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, I wrote that I had decided to end this blog. When I woke up this morning, I immediately realized that it was the wrong decision.
Crazy? Maybe.
But that’s how it sometimes is. You can’t always reason your way to the right decision. At least, I can’t. I’d been pondering this for weeks...
It was only when the idea became a reality that I realized it was a bad one. I wish I could avoid taking these detours in my decision-making process, but I’ve come to realize that will probably never happen.
And when you think about it, that “detour” is actually a shortcut to the right decision. Weeks of theoretical pondering didn’t help at all, while taking concrete action gave me an answer in a few hours.
Detours can be shortcuts, at least sometimes and for me. Sorry for the confusion — and welcome to my world. I hope you have the patience to stick around...</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s this re-explained with a simpler example.
Imagine you have 1,000 votes. You want to show that your political party got 60% of the vote, so, you claim:
My party: 600 votes
Opposition: 300 votes
Other: 100 votes
Presto, we got a good breakdown. The people will buy it....
It makes sense that 600 is exactly 60% of 1,000, because this was an artificial example.
But in the real world, we don&#x27;t get 1,000 votes.
We get 10,058,774 votes. What are the odds that the % of votes you get is a round number like 60%, or 51.2%? They&#x27;re infinitesimally small. You&#x27;re much more likely to get ugly numbers, like 59.941323854% of the vote, unless you choose some artificial percentage and work backward.</span>

The email also arrived in my spam folder, so I was lucky to even see it. Once I got back to them they did increase the cutoff by a few days but it has since been stopped.
Their new prices seemed insane to me.</span>

                              <span>I built a service around helping podcasters automatically convert their audio podcast into a YouTube channel. I went through tons of review with Google in order to get access to the YouTube API and make sure everything I was doing was in compliance with their terms - literally months of back and forth. I had been testing in my development and staging environments against their API for 6+ months. I launched in production, got a few videos uploaded to YouTube, and they disabled my API key. I spent months emailing them and never got anything more than the same boilerplate copy/pasted answer. I could have pivoted or something, but I just shut it down and moved on.  Lesson learned.</span>

                              <span>&gt;To which I say, are you really going to avoid using a good tool just because it makes you puke? Because looking at it makes your stomach churn? Because it offends every fiber of your being?&quot;
Yes.  A thousand times yes.  Because the biggest advantage of Markdown is that it&#x27;s easy to read, and its second-biggest advantage is that it&#x27;s easy to write.  How easy it is to parse doesn&#x27;t matter.  How easy it is to extend is largely irrelevant.
Markdown may or may not be the best tool for writing a book, but Markdown is the best tool for what it does - quickly writing formatted text in a way that is easy to read even for those who are not well versed in its syntax.
I don&#x27;t want to write a book.  If I did I&#x27;d use LaTeX before RST.  I want something to take notes, make quick documentation and thread comments.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long time Amazonian. The big problem is legacy employees run every part of the company. Almost any manager of managers has been at Amazon a long time, in that same job for a long time. There is no upward mobility at the company, unless you have been in some org 5+ years. In Alexa, the people running the core ML teams have been in Alexa since it started. Most people in decision making positions just got there first (10-15 years ago)
The software engineering paradigms used within the company create brittle rube goldberg machines of events flowing everywhere in the company. Almost all of them are on maintenance mode, where the oncall burns out the engineers and prevents them from creating new products. There is no knowledge sharing between team members. Legacy team members guard their technical platform knowledge to solidify their place on the team.
The engineers themselves are not students of computer science, but just crunch out tickets.
If Amazon wants to change they need to remove a significant amount of tenured employees, and actually promote young engineers into decision making positions.

it blows my mind
so i started to wonder: how do people find things they truly like?
i&#x27;ve been sitting with this question for a while now. i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ve ever liked something well enough to stick to it long-term

 CGT, Confederación General del Trabajo, is the confederation that represents the majoritarian sector of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism. The railway section of CGT is among the strongest in the confederation, and the 2015 elections, despite a frontal attack against the union aimed at reducing its representation, secured the presence of CGT in the works’ council of both RENFE and ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias, the Spanish railway…</span>

Source: Retrieved on July 29, 2021 from 

 On many levels it seems almost pointless to write yet another text on Aufhebengate, especially a review about a book on the scandal and the controversies and collaboration-sympathizing that occurred in the vain, and inexplicable, attempt to defend John Drury from his own actions. Usually interpersonal issues point more to the poverty of the militancy and viability of certain circles of so-called “radical scenes” than anything of consequence. In these cases I would usually not waste my time writing a critique of a second-rate academic who writes for a gener…</span>

Title: A Catalyst for Fascist Reaction
Date: 7/20/2024
Source: https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/a-catalyst-for-fascist-reaction/

 The fallout from the attempted assassination on United States presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, will bring an increase in fascist propaganda and reactionary attitudes, while also having serious societal repercussions for marginalized groups and political dissidents. While anarchists typically, and rightfully, disparage engagement in electoral politics, the occurrence of this event will likely have effects far beyond just the 2024 United States election. The main focus of this article is to engage with the likely fallout and effects of such an assassination attempt, rather than discuss the actuality of the attempt in a substantive manner.

                              <span>All software is built atop a core set of assumptions. As new code is added and new use-cases emerge, software can become unmoored from those assumptions. When this happens, a fundamental tension arises between revisiting those foundational assumptions—which usually entails a lot of work—or trying to support new behavior atop the existing architecture. The latter […]

Country drives, flea market barn jaunts, dinner with his mom, double dog walks + cuddled-up binging our favorite show.

He took me to see his parent&#x27;s house, where he grew up which he’s called home his entire life.
It&#x27;s strange to witness someone have such an intimate connection to land and environment. The ease and pride as he recounts the tapestry of stories that make up his town. I envy his deep roots.
I&#x27;ve moved so many times that I&#x27;ve lost count of how many addresses I&#x27;ve held.
He said he wanted to share his roots with me. Might have been the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me.

On Sunday, he took me to the Courtice Flea Market, where I found two records that I immediately bought:

Tony Molina, Confront The Truth, 2016. Think: Weezer, The Beatles, with a dash of punk.

Cat Power, Moon Pix, 1998. What a breathtaking cover.
