                              <span>The difference in their geochemistry is substantial so even if chromium isn&#x27;t technically that much more abundant, it&#x27;s significantly easier to mine.
The Gibbs free energy of formation for chromium oxides and chromite is much more negative than for lithium-bearing minerals so Cr compounds are thermodynamically favored to precipitate out of melts and solutions, forming minerals with high concentrations that then get pushed up by other processes. Li+, with its lone valence electron, just doesn&#x27;t form strong bonds or highly stable mineral phases in comparison. On top of that the diffusion coefficients for Cr species in magmas and rocks are generally orders of magnitude lower than for Li. Cr gets locked into crystal structures early and stays put, while Li keeps migrating and diffusing in the form of water soluble minerals. There&#x27;s also a whole biogeochemical cycle for Cr involving microbes that can concentrate it in sediments.</span>

                              <span>Pete Doherty&#x27;s reflection on happiness in the documentary Pete Doherty: Stranger in My Own Skin struck a chord with me:
Maybe happiness is not being able to know what’s gonna happen. Maybe if we knew the end of the story there wouldn’t be anymore story.
Thought-provoking. As if happiness is not essentially a phenomenon in itself, but rather the absence of something else: expectations, assumptions, preconceptions...
So much of our unhappiness would never take hold if we focused on the present instead of trying to predict the future. So much of our disappointment would more or less evaporate if we focused more on what we have than on what we think we lack.
This doesn&#x27;t mean we should stop setting goals. We can continue to look forward with excitement and evolve along the way. This continuous journey is the real goal, not the imaginary endpoint that we may or may not make a brief stop at along the way.
Seeing the beauty and forward momentum of never reaching a final destination, perhaps this is the essence of true, lasting happiness.</span>

                              <span>The best advice I can give you is to use bigserial for B-tree friendly primary keys and consider a string-encoded UUID as one of your external record locator options. Consider other simple options like PNR-style (airline booking) locators first, especially if nontechnical users will quote them. It may even be OK if they’re reused every few years. Do not mix PK types within the schema for a service or application, especially a line-of-business application. Use UUIDv7 only as an identifier for data that is inherently timecoded, otherwise it leaks information (even if timeshifted). Do not use hashids - they have no cryptographic qualities and are less friendly to everyday humans than the integers they represent; you may as well just use the sequence ID.  As for the encoding, do not use base64 or other hyphenated alphabets, nor any identifier scheme that can produce a leading ‘0’ (zero) or ‘+’ (plus) when encoded (for the day your stuff is pasted via Excel).
Generally, the principles of separation of concerns and mechanical sympathy should be top of mind when designing a lasting and purposeful database schema.
Finally, since folks often say “I like stripe’s typed random IDs” in these kind of threads: Stripe are lying when they say their IDs are random. They have some random parts but when analyzed in sets, a large chunk of the binary layout is clearly metadata, including embedded timestamps, shard and reference keys, and versioning, in varying combinations depending on the service.  I estimate they typically have 48-64 bits of randomness. That’s still plenty for most systems; you can do the same. Personally I am very fond of base58-encoded AES-encrypted bigserial+HMAC locators with a leading type prefix and a trailing metadata digit, and you can in a pinch even do this inside the database with plv8.</span>

                              <span>Lifepo4 (lithium iron phosphate) batteries for the home are pretty cheap as of today. Power storage for residential use in a 48v metal rackable linkable system with battery management system (BMS) is $89/kwh shipped/duty paid from reputable chinese suppliers CATL/Seplos etc. You have to wait for sea shipping, add $30/kwh if you want to buy it in the US today.
From the same suppliers sodium batteries are currently $130/kwh and about 26% less efficient in the same form factor. I look forward to this changing.
Due to rising power costs I moved one of my homes completely to solar and battery (lifepo4) and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to the power company. Panels have gotten to the point of being ridiculously cheap. I have a lot of space. I purchased pallets of used panels for more or less the cost of transportation ($34 per panel 270w). They produce about 85% of their nominal rating.
I mention this because other comments mention costs that are much much higher.</span>

                              <span>While this sucks, my phone is in so many data breaches at this point it doesn’t matter.
The spam-to-ham ratio on my phone number is now far worse than any other channel for me. The traditional phone network is at risk of going the way of the fax machine if we don’t do something about the spam problem like we did with email.
If I’m on a call, even with family, it’s now almost exclusively on FaceTime/zoom/meet/etc. I can’t remember the last time I talked on the traditional phone network or received a legitimate call. Which isn’t great because those aforementioned platforms are all proprietary walled gardens with terrible incentives — once they capture the market fully they will eventually dump ads all over your calls.

PowerShell faced extreme opposition at Microsoft, and its creator Jeffrey Snover was demoted for pursuing it.
Jeffrey was originally brought into Microsoft to help MS learn how to compete in the data center, but culturally they were so tied to the personal computer model of the world, that they fought him every step of the way.
Edit: Another interesting thing, is how Powershell exists because Windows isn&#x27;t file based. Jeffrey&#x27;s goal was server administration, but on Windows you can&#x27;t just edit files to administer things, you need to call various APIs and get structured data back forth. The rich object model fell out of that. It was the only way.
( Also, apologies if the transcript has errors. I&#x27;ve gone from professional transcriptions to Descript and then a pass of GPT4 trying to find the right punctation breaks and then me doing a quick read through. I don&#x27;t think its coming out as high quality as I&#x27;d like. )</span>

                              <span>I had similar thoughts. But let&#x27;s not overlook the information asymmetry, which contributed to the dissatisfaction. I don&#x27;t want to live in a world which is controlled unilaterally, and intransparently by a group of people who assume they have a full picture of the situation and assume they understand moral completely, and also don&#x27;t think it necessary to explain how they think so highly of themselves.</span>

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s worth repeating: Unless you have a stake in the company, it is NOT your job to make sure the company is the most profitable it can be. Your job is to create great software
This is a terrible take, and one I generally see as a signal of lack of seniority in a software dev. It is absolutely everybody&#x27;s job in the company to make sure it is profitable, unless you work for a non-profit.
The thing is though, that profitable is not the same as &quot;just ship it&quot;. If you&#x27;re in a company where those things are conflated frequently, that&#x27;s a sign of lack of seniority in management.
&gt; Your job is to create great software
It really isn&#x27;t, your job is to make a great product. Making a great product often, but not always, requires great software. Many great products have terrible software behind them. The tension between product, sales and development should result in a compromise that creates the most value short, middle and long term. It is 100% your job as a developer to understand what can and cannot be hacked, what priorities the company has beside delivering great software, and finally: when great software must be made, because compromise is unwise.
Just like the boy who cried wolf, the developer who can never compromise on software quality is powerless when there is an actual reason to not compromise on software quality, and rightfully so.</span>

                              <span>I am not defending Shipt and there is no doubt gig workers are in a very vulnerable position. However, the data analysis results as presented in the article do not support the article&#x27;s main point. &quot;40% are getting paid at least 10% less&quot; is not unnatural to expect whenever pay is redistributed, especially since some 30+% are getting at least 10% more. Imagine a _hypothetical_ situation where Shipt is 100% on point and driving a fairer version of the algorithm patch removing a way for workers to &quot;optimize&quot; for short, well paid trips, resulting in pay cuts to those who had learnt how to do it, while not changing/increasing pay for everyone else. We would see the same kind of result: some portion of workers would get paid 10% less, some 10% more. This does show that workers are paid differently for the same work they have been doing, but does not prove the change is unfair.</span>

 An anarchist walks out of a punk show to smoke. On her vest are anarchist patches with various standard slogans, “No Gods No Masters,” “Death To Transphobes,” “Kill Your Local Rapist,” “All Cops Are Bastards,” “Punch Nazis,” “From The River To The Sea Palestine Will Be Free,” “Make Total Destroy,” “The Only Good Cop Is A Dead Cop,” “Eat The Rich,” “Death Before Detransition” and… “Fire To The Prisons.” 
 A suddenly red-faced bystander trots up to her to argue.

 I thought further and said: “Why do men lie over problems of such great importance, even to the point of destroying themselves?” and they seemed to do so because although they pretend to know all, they know nothing.

                              <span>I heard an interview with Rachel &quot;Yoga Girl&quot; Bråthén. She talked about how certain things in her past, like being vegan, became a kind of identity. It was all or nothing. &quot;This is me. This is who I am. End of story!&quot;
It&#x27;s easy to get too attached to that kind of self-image, whether it&#x27;s advocating for healthy eating or reviewing cell phones.
Looking back, I can relate to this myself. Yoga, meditation, mindfulness, weight training, blogging, and more have all served as a “false” sense identity for me at some point — at least to some extent.
Of course, it&#x27;s not what we do that&#x27;s the problem; it&#x27;s how we see ourselves in relation to what we do. You can have a million followers and still be the most grounded person in the world.
No matter how &quot;important&quot; or &quot;unimportant&quot; our roles in life are, it&#x27;s good to remind ourselves of this truth from time to time. Status and possessions come and go, but who we are on a deeper level remains.</span>

                              <span>A lot of my posts have covered stuff I don&#x27;t ever have the time of day to talk about. I work too much and almost all of my coworkers are conservative boomers. I don&#x27;t talk to most of them  much but every once in a while I&#x27;ll have to share a store with some of them. Sometimes they give me random phone calls. Luckily I have the option of just not picking up the phone.
I just don&#x27;t relate with the people I have to interact with on the regular. I mean we aren&#x27;t having heavy political conversations 24/7 but it just doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable being around people who you know are the polar opposite of who you are.
I feel like being able to write about the stuff I never get to talk about is a healthy counterweight to that. I&#x27;m not a great writer, I know a lot of the stuff I write won&#x27;t be read for weeks, or possibly ever. Some of it might be boring or come across cheesy. Sometimes I cover really broad, uninteresting things.
But it has had the unexpected effect of making me feel more valid as a person. It feels odd saying that, but it&#x27;s true.
Maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t had a hobby I can get lost in for too long. Making the rounds in different indie web neighborhoods, learning little bits of CSS and bringing my vision to life one piece at a time does a pretty good job at keeping me from getting bored and letting my mind wander to stress. Then when I&#x27;m done with that for a while I can write some more. Sometimes I&#x27;m proud of it, sometimes I delete it after a couple hours.
It feels... healthier than doomscrolling. I prefer this over traditional social media because of the ownership and freedom, and the fact that I sort of get to whisper what I&#x27;m saying rather than blasting it over a megaphone and putting myself on stage in front of an audience riding algorithmic dopamine waves.</span>

                              <span>- OpenBLAS isn&#x27;t _that_ optimized for any specific modern architecture.
- The matrices weren&#x27;t that big. Numpy has cffi overhead.
- The perf difference was much more noticeable with _peak_ throughput rather than _mean_ throughput, which matters for almost no applications (a few, admittedly, but even where &quot;peak&quot; is close to the right measure you usually want something like the mean of the top-k results or the proportion with under some latency, ...).
- The benchmarking code they displayed runs through Python&#x27;s allocator for numpy and is suggestive of not going through any allocator for the C implementation. Everything might be fine, but that&#x27;d be the first place I checked for microbenchmarking errors or discrepancies (most numpy routines allow in-place operations; given that that&#x27;s known to be a bottleneck in some applications of numpy, I&#x27;d be tempted to explicitly examine benchmarks for in-place versions of both).
- Numpy has some bounds checking and error handling code which runs regardless of the underlying implementation. That&#x27;s part of why it&#x27;s so bleedingly slow for small matrices compared to even vanilla Python lists (they tested bigger matrices too, so this isn&#x27;t the only effect, but I&#x27;ll mention it anyway). It&#x27;s hard to make something faster when you add a few thousand cycles of pure overhead.
- This was a very principled approach to saturating the relevant caches. It&#x27;s &quot;obvious&quot; in some sense, but clear engineering improvements are worth highlighting in discussions like this, in the sense that OpenBLAS, even with many man-hours, likely hasn&#x27;t thought of everything.
And so on. Anyone can rattle off differences. A proper explanation requires an actual deep-dive into both chunks of code.</span>

                              <span>This reminds me of something that I heard once from a Chinese teacher. I can&#x27;t vouch for the accuracy of it, but he was definitely on to something: In the West, it is assumed that it is the speaker&#x27;s job to make himself understood to his listeners. In the East, it is the other way around.
In recent times, it seems like we&#x27;ve gotten even more extreme. The speaker or writer must not only spoon-feed the understanding, they also have to provide the motivation and the entertainment. Which I find sad, because some things you can&#x27;t get unless you go to the effort of extracting them yourself. (See many reproducible psychology findings about retention being highly correlated with depth of processing, for example.) It&#x27;s like the information equivalent of highly processed food.
I find myself falling into this trap on sites like this. An interesting but difficult article will be posted, I won&#x27;t immediately know what to think or where I stand on the topic, and I&#x27;ll flip to the comments so that I can get some part of the collective to tell me what to think and how to feel about it. Which is also sad.
In paintings, it is known that the viewer can get out more than the painter put in. It used to be the same with writing, but it feels like that is becoming more rare and less acceptable. If a reader can&#x27;t follow the argument, it&#x27;s automatically the author&#x27;s fault and a waste of the reader&#x27;s time. Heaven forbid the reader might need to exert some effort and grow in the gleaning.</span>

                              <span>According to Jensen it takes about 8000 H100s running for 90 days to train a 1.8 Trillion param MoE GPT-4 scale model.
Meta has about 350,000 of these GPUs and a whole bunch of A100s. This means the ability to train 50 GPT-4 scale models every 90 days or 200 such models per year.
This level of overkill suggests to me that the core models will be commoditized to oblivion, making the actual profit margins from AI-centric companies close to 0, especially if Microsoft and Meta keep giving away these models for free.
This is actually terrible for investors, but amazing for builders (ironically).
The real value methinks is actually over the control of proprietary data used for training which is the single most important factor for model output quality. And this is actually as much an issue for copyright lawyers rather than software engineers once the big regulatory hammers start dropping to protect American workers.</span>

                              <span>My secret protip: old Fujitsu desktop/nuc PCs. At least in Germany (Europe?) they are cheap on ebay since a lot of businesses use them and upgrade on a regular schedule.
If you care about power consumption like I do, you can Google &quot;$model energy consumption white paper&quot; which contains very accurate data about idle usage, for example https://sp.ts.fujitsu.com/dmsp/Publications/public/wp-energy...
In one case I had a nuc where on Linux after enabling power saving features for the sata controller, idle usage even fell to 5W when the pdf claimed 9.
Having an actual pc instead of a random sbc ensures best connectivity, expandability, and software support forever. With almost all sbcs you&#x27;re stuck with a random-ass kernel from when the damn thing was released, and you basically have to frankenstein together your own up-to-date distro with the old kernel because the vendor certainly doesn&#x27;t care about updating the random armbian fork they created for that thing.</span>

                              <span>The author links to the somewhat dystopian blog where the email sender is quite proud of their work. Their words (or perhaps that of an LLM):
&gt; Could an AI agent craft compelling emails that would capture people&#x27;s attention and drive engagement, all while maintaining a level of personalization that feels human? I decided to find out.
&gt; The real hurdle was ensuring the emails seemed genuinely personalized and not spammy. I knew that if recipients detected even a whiff of a generic, mass-produced message, they&#x27;d tune out immediately.
&gt; Incredibly, not a single recipient seemed to detect that the emails were AI-generated.
https://www.wisp.blog/blog/how-i-use-ai-agents-to-send-1000-...
The technical part surprised me: they string together multiple LLMs which do all the work. It&#x27;s a shame the author&#x27;s passions are directed towards AI slop-email spam, all for capturing attention and driving engagement.
How much of our societal progress and collective thought and innovation has gone to capturing attention and driving up engagement, I wonder.</span>

 There are anarchists who run after uprisings on other continents wherever the spotlights of the media fall. There are anarchists who talk about “fortress Europe” and they don’t even know which States are part of the EU. There are anarchists who struggle against the borders and they don’t even know where the Schengen frontier runs. There are anarchists who, like “good white men”, see in the “dark-skinned” non-EU people potential comrades, and they don’t even notice that there are European non-EU people.

 When I translated and published the pamphlet &quot;Individuality and the anarchist group&quot;, signed by one of the CCF cells, Guerilla Urbana Cell, I added in a note that I didn’t do it because I agree with the content, but to make public how much this project, in my opinion, has turned away from its original form of tension to propose (or re-propose) an anarchist individualism which, in some ways, can be found in the pages of a different insurrectionist theory, but in this case approaching or even in some points leading to formal ideas, that is the formal organization.

 Violence generates violence. Regardless of what is right or wrong, no matter how abstruse is the boundary between opposites and how easily they can converge. The word violence and the concept it expresses present deep mystifications to those who have the monopoly on it. All expressions of dissent are being disproportionately repressed… no surprise… ‘go and tell them that it’s springtime’ [rough translation of ‘vagli a spiegare che è primavera’, a verse by the late anarchist singer and song-writer Fabrizio De Andrè].

The first 2 years as a retail trader, I had one of those so called &quot;well-rounded lives&quot;. I traded, went out often, hung out after the close with friends &amp; fam, enjoyed snowboarding, camping, and mountain biking more than most.

To show the estimated number of minutes it takes to read a blog post, add the following script to the footer directive of your Bear blog:


This shows the estimated reading time just below the post date, using 255 words per minute as an average reading speed. The placement and reading speed can be changed by adding the following data attributes to the script:
data-before-child: [number] (defaults to 4)
data-wpm: [number] (defaults to 255)
For example, to put the estimated reading time above the post date and set an average reading speed of 200 words per minute, use the following script:

                              <span>This post discusses the distributional consequences of an aggressive policy response to inflation using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We find that, when facing demand shocks, stabilizing inflation and real activity go hand in hand, with very large benefits for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution. The converse is true however when facing supply shocks: stabilizing inflation makes real outcomes more volatile, especially for poorer households. We conclude that distributional considerations make it much more important for policy to take into account the tradeoffs between stabilizing inflation and economic activity. This is because the optimal policy response depends very strongly on whether these tradeoffs are present (that is, when the economy is facing supply shocks) or absent (when the economy is facing demand shocks).</span>

Translator’s Introduction
 At the dawn of the 20th century, Europe hosted a brief blossoming of individualistic thought. Inspired by the great thinkers of the preceding century such as Stirner, Ibsen, Nietzsche, and Spencer, they offered a free-thinking, non-dogmatic alternative to the increasingly powerful Marxists and syndicalists of the left, and the economists and theologians of the right. Importantly, this generation of thinkers developed the critique of the State into a critique of society as a whole, which immunized them from recruitment by the anarchist movement. As Ryner says in the Handbook, the anarchists are naive: victory by the anarchist…</span>

 Abuse is ubiquitous in our society, and as a result there are very few among us, if any, who have not been abused themselves or in proximity to someone else being abused. Myths about why and how abuse occurs run rampant and the ones that dominate are ones that ultimately serve in the maintenance of the status quo that keeps victims disempowered and silent. As a result, even those few who do actually believe victims of abuse and see the danger such abuse poses to them still often respond to the conditions the victim is entrapped within in ways that ultimately affirm the abuser’s narrative and fur…</span>

 An accident. An accident tore a family apart. An accident took a brave and kind comrade from us. We will remember the date. It was December 2023. 
 Death will come for us all. But, for now, we must put our shattered hearts back together. We need to organize. We need to fight. We need to grieve. Yet, we are not free to grieve, the same way we are not free to be. Not free to love. Not free to live. Countless surviving families and friends were vultured in one of their most vulnerable times. Countless victims of patriarchal honor killings were buried by their murderers. Count…</span>

Notes: From Sheffield Action Group’s Troublemakers zine, this important piece stands on its own

 As students at university, we have a lot more to say about the global and national role of our institutions — this will come at another point. For now we will focus on primary and secondary school. Many reading this will have left 13 years of schooling, likely hating most of it, and may not have thought a lot about the scale of its impact on our lives and how things could have been so, so different. 
 School is a class stratifier along eugenic lines. Those deemed more intelligent by their ability to absorb and spit out information in tests are seen as more suited for higher paying jobs and therefore, by this society’s lo…</span>

 Imagination is a magic carpet

 To any planet in the sky 
 If we came from nowhere here 
 Why can’t we go somewhere there?

 Generally men, rightly or wrongly, claim to have an intellectual and moral superiority over women, in addition to physical superiority. So be it! I want to grant it. 
 Strangely enough, in the vast majority of cases the man who considers himself superior to the woman takes little or no effort to reduce her inferiority and to raise the woman to his level. 
 This happens more especially among men who have a wife or partner. It would be logical that, if only out of a feeling of pride, the h…</span>

 And they said, oh, are you the the lads that have come to fight in Lebanon? And we said yeah, that’s us. And we sat in the back of this Peugeot car and I remember Lero nudging me, and there was a handgun underneat the dashboard and there was a butt of what was a Kalashnikov underneath one of the seats. So I was like, well, this is the real deal isn’t it?

 The ecological crisis profoundly impacts the material conditions of social reproduction, extending beyond “natural disasters” to encompass a deepening of the contradictions inherent in capitalism. This crisis does not only manifest itself in events like floods, droughts, and pandemics, it also plays a direct role in fueling conflicts, social unrest, and mass displacement. In what follows, we attempt to lay out a comprehensive argument for the connection between the ecological crisis and the rise of what we call the post-fascist current, a poli…</span>

 In its Spring 2001 issue, the Oregon-based magazine Green Anarchy ran an anonymous article with the title: “The EZLN is NOT Anarchist: Or Struggles at the Margins and Revolutionary Solidarity.” Writing from an anarchist perspective, the author advanced a fierce critique of the Zapatista National Liberation Army—the militant anticolonial, anticapitalist Indigenous movement which had led an uprising and established autonomous zones in southern Mexico several years before, and which is often cited by anarchists as an example of a suc…</span>

 If there are two contemporary anarchist theorists whose work occupies and influences my thought the most, they are Kevin Carson and Wayne Price. Carson has spent a huge segment of his career not just reconstructing a mutualist political economy as an alternative to the anarchist default to the economics of Karl Marx but also making incredibly original contributions to the fields of decentralized technology/production and spontaneous organization theory. Wayne Price in turn has dedicated his mind to a task that at first seems wholly opposite to Carson’s: working to adapt Marxist economics and political strategy to an anarchist co…</span>

 A wave of campus building occupations took place in response to austerity measures following the recession of 2008. As today’s Gaza solidarity movement begins to experiment with encampments and building occupations, it could be instructive to learn from the previous generation of student activists. 
 On April 22, 2024, inspired by the resilience of the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University and other demonstrators around the country, students at Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, California occupied Siemens Hall. This represented the first confrontational bu…</span>

 On April 17, students at Columbia University and Barnard College set up an encampment in solidarity with Palestinians facing genocide at the hands of the Israeli military. On April 18, the university administration brought in massive numbers of police to arrest the demonstrators and crush the encampment; yet in response, students established a new encampment, bigger than the first, inspiring copycat actions from Yale to St. Loui…</span>

Abstract
 In this text, written as a speech for the 1st Anarchist Fair in Rio de Janeiro, contradictions of the historically predatory relationship of brazilian democracy with brazilian travestis and transsexuals are presented, paying attention to the ontological marginality of the travesti body under the capitalist patriarchy of white supremacy. Based on this reflection, transfeminist challenges to radical and anarchist…</span>

 Society has plunged into a world-wide war, but we Anarchists, we cannot shed tears over its horrors, as do the Socialists and other so-called philanthropists. WE KNOW how industriously those same weepers have been piling up the fuel which made this conflagration certain. 
 Governments have made this war. The Austrian government ordered its slaves to sweep Servia with fire and sword. The German government snapped its fingers at the four million and odd Socialist voters, and ordered its slaves to invade Belgium. The American government with hypocritical sobs and sighs, ordered its slaves …</span>

                              <span>I really love the idea of having a Blogroll. When checking out a new blog, after reading and perusing said blog, I typically check to see if it has one. I think it’s one of the best ways to find new people to subscribe to, new content to read, and/or new perspectives to be exposed to. However, I don’t have one on my blog. Hypocritical? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just really personal preference.
I grew up in the days of MySpace, and this irrational want to be included in everyone’s Top 8. Then when you’re in their Top 8, you watch that list like a hawk in case you drop from Top 2 to Top 5, or even worse, drop off altogether. Granted, blogrolls are a bit different since there’s no hard limit on how many can be included (or specified order), but the idea is similar.
You see, I’m fine and OK with no…</span>

Here&#x27;s a rolling list of posts, blogs, and links that I&#x27;ve been enjoying. Links will roll off (from the bottom) when the list hits 30 posts and will be highlighted in my Week Notes for posterity purposes.

                              <span>I spent the long weekend clearing the cobwebs from my apartment.
The main purge was throwing out YEARS of old diaries and journals—all of them. Not one survived.
I&#x27;ve been thinking about doing this for a long time. Reading them made me feel horrible, and they all seemed to circle the same themes. Lugging those boxes full of journals to each new apartment felt tiresome. It was time to let them go.
I feel good about it. I&#x27;m free: to untangle myself from past narratives; from reinforcing and remembering things I don&#x27;t wish to remember; to change; to reinvent the person I want to be.
Next on the to-get-rid-of list: books, clothes, paper ephemera, apps, expired kitchen things, tucked-away closet articles, + bathroom items.

                              <span>Productivity gurus and hacks have killed the essence of getting bored. Do you think Da Vinci was obsessed with utilising every minute of the day? Do you think Tolstoy wrote with discipline? I am not suggesting you go ahead and waste your time, but if you are a creative person, productivity will only get you so far.
But what do I mean by getting bored? Getting bored implies your brain is free of pressing thoughts. There’s no sense of urgency in your mind. It could be for any reason. When there’s no sense of urgency in your mind, there’s calmness. People suffering from anxiety do not get bored; their thoughts and fears keep them occupied.
When your mind is free from pressing tasks, fear, and worries, it tends to get lost. It wanders. In these wanderings, you dwell upon the thoughts buried deep in the subconscious. Every writer would swear by the benefits of walking. When you go out to walk, your mind is tranquil. It is in sync with nature. That’s when your body digs deeper into the subconscious and helps you find the pearl.
Productivity hacks are excellent when you are focused on a singular task. They are excellent in improving your efficiency by inculcating discipline, like writing a book or a bunch of essays. That’s when you need productivity hacks to stay motivated and meet the deadline. The Pomodoro technique is good for helping you finish tasks. It does not invoke creativity, though.
When you want to create something, you need to get bored. You need to let your thoughts mingle with each other and discover a new perspective on the problem. Creation requires empty space and time. The more successful you are in creating this, the better your overall output will be. So, get bored.</span>

                              <span>Qualifier: Former US special operations operator that served in multiple wars.
My anecdotal take is there are many ways that shock and trauma can accumulate through training and war that are far beyond the minimal effects of an M4.
Firearms: While the primary weapons systems are the M4 and side arm (pistol), there are many weapons systems utilized by special operations such as sniper rifles, crew serve weapons, and niche small arms.
The M82 sniper rifle shoots a 50 BMG round. In either the bolt action or semi-auto versions they feel like you are getting punched in the face when you shoot them.
Crew serve weapons like the MK19 and M2 do pack a punch.  The MK19 is a machine gun that shoots 40mm grenades.  The M2 is a .50 cal machine gun.  These weapons systems are mounted, but the percussion of them is still far greater than an M4.
More niche arms like the M249 SAW, M16 HBAR, full-auto AKs, M240 Golf, MP9, etc are not as mild as the standard M4/M16.
Blasts: There are many types of blasts encountered such as Mortars (inbound and outbound), Flash Bangs, Entry charges, IEDs, Landmines, etc.  These do make your head ring if you are close enough to them.
In my own personal experience there are many other daily jarring events that aren&#x27;t nearly as sexy to talk about.  Riding in the back of a 5 ton will almost shake your brain out of your head.  Riding in an LCAC (hovercraft) is like riding in a 5 ton.  Doing boat work in Zodiacs will bounce you all over the place, especially when doing surf passages.  Doing hydrographic surveys right where the surf breaks will pound you for hours and make you a little sick afterwards. When your chute opens on a jump, if jumping round chutes, will make you see stars...the landing is not a soft pretty one like rectangle chutes...you hit the ground hard.
There are many more ways your body gets pounded on a daily basis far in excess of the weapons you use.</span>

                              <span>This post and the next discuss the distributional effects of inflation and inflation stabilization through the lenses of a theoretical model—a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. This model combines the features of New Keynesian models that have been the workhorse for monetary policy analysis since the work of Woodford (2003) with inequality in wealth and income at the household level following the seminal contribution of Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018). We find that while inflation hurts everyone, it hurts the poor in particular. When the source of inflation is a supply shock, fighting inflation aggressively hurts the poor even more, however, while the opposite is true for demand shocks, as discussed in the companion post.</span>

                              <span>Agreed. I mainly manage and review code at this point in my career. I find many bugs, every once in a while finding something that would have caused an outage or notable problem for users.
What I find more though is code that isn&#x27;t thought through. Tech debt and code smell are real, and they affect the performance of a team. Nipping that in the bud takes quality PR reviews and time to meet with submitters around issues you find.
Knock on wood but working at the company I do now where I, along with my team, have made quality PR reviews normal.. our codebase is now enjoyable and fun to work on. I highly recommend it!
One key aspect is being “kind, not nice”. Be helpful when leaving comments in PRs, but don’t be nice for the sake of avoiding conflict.
Also if you find code reviews to be a waste of time I can reccomend one thing I do often - give warnings. I approve and give comments around things I’d like to be fixed in the future for similar PRs. I don’t hold up the merge for little things, but at the same time I won’t let the little things slide forever</span>

                              <span>Article III of the U.S. Constitution is incredibly brief [1].
I propose the Supreme Court be reconstituted such that for each case a panel of judges from the appellate courts is chosen by lot. They hear that case, write their opinion, and then go back to that work. New case, new lot.
Having a permanent bench of judicial oligarchs made sense before telecommunication. It doesn’t anymore. Every ancient democracy used randomness to control corruption. I think it’s time we took a lesson from them.
(Note: this could be done by statute. How the supreme Court is constituted is entirely left to Congress.)

Title: Anti-Social Anarchy
Subtitle: A Short Response to Ausonia Calabrese’s “Against Individualism”
Date: Mar 20, 2020
Notes: Warzone Distro
Source: anarchistnews.org

 Marxism shares one thing in common with other authoritarian ideologies: they are against the individual. Even when Marxists claim to be anarchists or “anti-state communists,” they make sure that masses and classes are always more important than actual people. This is as obvious in Tiqqun or Theory of Bloom as it is in Stalin’s “Anarchism” or “Socialism”, and now, in Ausonia Calabrese’s Against Individualism. The fact that someone identifying themselves as an anarchist or a Stirnite could ever claim to be against individualism is beyond me, but I digress. 
 The main gist of the essay is that individuals ar…</span>

In a revolt against techno-optimism and the real-world violence it upholds, members of radical research collective Lucy Parsons Labs (LPL) call for an empiricism rooted in technopolitical critique. Drawing from their own years of labor in the struggles against racial and surveillance capitalism, current work in HCI, and radical theorists like Alfredo M. Bonanano and Modibo Kadalie, LPL invites us to incorporate an ethics of rebellion and progress our tech practices into principled, anti-authoritarian praxis.

                              <span>Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Treasury has issued debt in two main forms: nominal bonds, which provide fixed-cash scheduled payments, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—or TIPS—which provide the holder with inflation-protected payments that rise with U.S. inflation. At the heart of their relative valuation lie market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an object of interest for academics, policymakers, and investors alike. After briefly reviewing the theoretical and empirical links between TIPS and Treasury yields, this post, based on a recent research paper, explores whether market perceptions of U.S. sovereign credit risk can help explain the relative valuation of these financial instruments.</span>

Yes, there&#x27;s a full city beneath those trees.
However, this is not what the land originally looked like.
To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It&#x27;s known colloquially as eGoli, or &quot;The City of Gold&quot;. Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don&#x27;t have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it&#x27;s mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.
This form of extraction leads to the crushing of millions of tons of ro…</span>

While I had already conceptualized and begun writing this piece prior to the publication of “An Anarchist Anti-Gun Manifesto,” the final form of “No Such Thing as Neutral” has been largely influenced by the response to the former. In particular, I was inspired by the common response of guns being “a tool” and “therefore neutral,” of the assumption that my critique of guns, and their world of relations, was of a moral character, and as such the concept of “neutrality” would hold some rhetorical weight. This piece is an attempt to break out of the confinement of moral frameworks …</span>

 We must bear in mind that no government, honest as it is, can decree the abolition of misery. It is the people themselves, the hungry, the disinherited, who have to abolish misery. – Ricardo Flores Magón (Regeneration, Nov. 19, 1910) 
 Once again, the indigenous peoples are forgotten in the oblivion; There is not a single security measure by governments to protect us, and the indigenous women are triple violated.

 This afternoon we met with Dolores Villalobo from the Consejo Indígena Popular de Oaxaca “Ricardo Flores Magón” (CIPO-RFM). She began the discussion with an explanation of who was Ricardo Flores Magón–an Indigenous person from Oaxaca who rose up against Porfirio Diáz in the Mexican Revolution. He was persecuted so fled into exile into the United States, but was imprisoned at Levenworth where he was executed. Franciso Madero offered him the vice presidency, but Flores Magón said he preferred jail to his government that was not of the people and who did not represent the change for which they had fought. Dolores said that …</span>

What is Anarchism?
 Anarchism is a political theory which opposes the State and capitalism. It says that people with economic power (capitalists) and those with political power (politicians of all stripes left, right or centre) use that power for their own benefit, and not (like they claim) for the benefit of society. Anarchism says that neither exploitation nor government is natural or necessary, and that a society based on freedom, mutual aid and equal shares of the good things in life would work better than this one. 
 Anarchism is also a political movement. Anarchists take part in day-to-day struggl…</span>

                              <span>So, here goes.
Being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is especially hard when I live alone, well, sort of. I don’t talk much with my mom. Maybe I should, but I don’t intend to talk to her for the moment. That means, despite living with her under the same roof, I feel very lonely. And my mental health starts to deteriorate when I am alone and bored.
Thoughts could drive someone crazy when that is all they have being the single person in the room.
I am turning to y’all for support, so please write me emails at corneliuswastaken@proton.me. I would love anything. Book /music/video games recommendations, memes, photos of your pet, tell me about yourself. Heck, send me a string of random letters and numbers if you want. It is just nice to know that there is someone out there listening to my rambling, and that I am not alone. Expect the reply to happen in a while though. Replying to messages becomes a chore when self-care is in dire need.
Thank you.</span>
