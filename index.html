Donald Trump’s MAGA hate speech includes such descriptions of non-European immigrants as “stone cold killers,” “immigrant criminals from the dungeons of the world,” “rapist,” “pet eaters” — or “invaders” from across the southern border. Some may find Trump’s words pleasing and others dreadful, but he is far from original. More

They want to know his last meal request and if he wants a preacher to be with him. Ultimately, they even ask if he wants a chance to escape. The prisoner, named John Coffey, tells them he&#x27;s ready to go, starting his speech with a resigned &quot;I&#x27;m tired boss.&quot; Brother, I can relate.

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.
Hard disagree. If you cant decompose to avoid &quot;wonky parameters&quot; then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.
IME &quot;heavy&quot; function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.</span>

1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.
2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.
So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”</span>

I’m writing this with a fresh cup of actually good coffee because…
☕ We fixed our Nespresso. Or, to give credit where credit is due, LC did. We thought our Nespresso broke a month ago, but it just didn’t tell us it was time to descale it again. In our defense, we just descaled it, and the app didn’t notify us… so how are we supposed to know? Either way, I have been drinking freshly brewed coffee this week, instead of the typical instant/pre-made coffee I’ve succumbed to during the weeks in between.
🍚 The following week, our rice cooker also broke. As a half Asian (me) household, this is a definite no-no. The broken rice cooker was barely $30 from 2020, so it really was about time. This time, we got one that LC has been eyeing for awhile, and reminds u…</span>

                              <span>For me, it takes a long time to create something like the Bear Micro Blog. An &quot;unnecessarily&quot; long time.
Partly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an amateur. But that&#x27;s not the main reason. Nor is it a matter of perfection.
It&#x27;s because I find it relaxing.
Coding is like meditation for me. A perfect blend of focus and relaxation—a kind of timeless void. I&#x27;m often surprised when I look at the clock and realize how much time has passed.
They say time is money. Considering how rewarding these precious moments are to me, it’s a bargain.</span>

 TO THE HEART OF IT: Gaza has been a free kill zone and a “concentration camp” (to quote Israel’s National Security Director Giora Eiland in 2004), long before October 7. 
 In light of this, the most radical position comes directly from the simplest question: are Palestinians human beings? If your answer is emphatically yes, unambiguously and without reservations, then you are a lost cause to Zionism. Because if Palestinians are human beings, then their self-defense is legitimate, and the defense of their continued existence is necessary. 
 Gaza, this black box, this holding pen for refugees from the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine—can we think of it…</span>

                              <span>&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?
All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.</span>

 the world is looking dire right now. it seems like everything is worse than it has ever been, or maybe just like things suddenly flipped back to &quot;bad&quot; after a brief period where it seemed to be getting better. but no matter what happened or how, one thing is clear: the number of socially acceptable targets…</span>

                              <span>Inspired by Sylvia and mgx, I decided to create a Bear Micro Blog, or status log, or shorts page – whatever you want to call it.
It&#x27;s quite a simple solution, using tags and the Bear class_name snippet. Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I&#x27;m planning to create an Apple Shortcut.
I&#x27;ve also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:
RSS Feed for All Content
RSS Feed for Blog Posts
RSS feed for Status Updates
Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.
Wishing you a great weekend!

                              <span>Let’s talk about tech interviews – specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you’re a developer who’s been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I’m talking about. It’s becoming a trend, and it’s not helping anyone.
Unrealistic Tests That Don’t Measure Real Skills
These high-stress, solo coding assignments don’t reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they’d never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures “problem-solving” skills.
The Hidden Time Sink
What companies often ignore is the extra time cand…</span>

                              <span>Letters of recommendation from faculty advisors play a critical role in the job market for Ph.D. economists. At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate’s potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.</span>

                              <span>I’m realizing that what bothers me about teaching is everything feels way too important. In prepping my lessons, the slides, the activities, etc., I have to always be thinking about how all those things affect the kids. How do they enhance their understanding? How do they engage them? Could I be more flexible in certain areas, or are there skills or topics I really need the kids to understand in a certain way? How can I design this class such that they interact more with each other, have more agency over their learning, can keep up?
Dropping the ball on any aspect of teaching feels huge. When a lesson flops, I feel like I wasted my kids’ time and mine. My evenings are spent thinking about how to get the next one right. There’s no part of this job where I feel I can relax my grip or afford …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s cold enough this week to make me pause at the coat closet before I leave the apartment. Choosing poorly can mean the difference between being cozy and getting sick. Hand &amp; body cream have appeared in the bathrooms at work (though only the wheelchair accessible ones, which really makes you think). These feel like the real signs that winter is here, not a date on the calendar. Are they going to change what months count as winter when the daily average high in November climbs to the sixties every year?
The office is eerily quiet. A and her posse are out of town for a work retreat, and I&#x27;m the only one left behind sitting in their pod of desks. I miss chatting with them and being yanked from my daydreams when they come by with treats. Their absence reminds me how much happier I am now tha…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s kind of a weird time for me right now. I quit my job last week without having another one lined up. My wife is going through a lot of things right now, and me being home hasn&#x27;t been the best thing for our bank account but I think it&#x27;s the best thing for us right now. Sadly, all of this came together at the same time as the election, my birthday, and the upcoming holidays which is making for an even more stressful time than typical.
To make matters a bit worse, I haven&#x27;t felt good about retreating into the places that I typically do. A lot of my blogging friends are in pain over the election. My Mastodon feed is depressing, as is most of my RSS. So, I haven&#x27;t really had a place to just breathe online, which has led me to avoid the internet more than usual. Granted, that isn&#x27;t a bad thi…</span>

We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group. We talked about the poor man’s David Tennant in our group and B’s weird partner who made them a really elaborate card that B felt burdened by. The conversation was vivid and true to life, and I texted B about it when …</span>

                              <span>Ask me anything - Do you consider blogging to be an art form?
One thing I absolutely despise is elitism is any form, followed closely by gatekeeping. Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It&#x27;s an attempt to bring something conjured in one&#x27;s creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.

Title: Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot
Subtitle: The necessity to write our own histories
Date: November 9th, 2024
Source: Retrieved on November 14th 2024 from https://bccounterinfo.org/2024/11/09/yintah-documentary-film-review-anarchists-in-the-blind-spot-or-the-necessity-to-write-our-own-histories/

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them.

&gt; if you ...
&gt; for example ...
Yes there seems to be lots of potential. Yes we can brainstorm things that should work. Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it&#x27;s a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to hide those from them.
Show me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.
LLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don&#x27;t have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It&#x27;s a really hard problem with LLM based tools.
There is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.</span>

                              <span>Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we&#x27;ve exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?
I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It&#x27;s my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.
GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.
For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build &quot;expert bots&quot; that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.
If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.
Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.
Chasing after model improvements and &quot;GPT-5 will be PHD-level&quot; is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.
Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don&#x27;t know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.
Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That&#x27;s a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit &quot;weird&quot; (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.</span>

                              <span>I have a bit of uneasiness about how this is heavily pushing GitHub actions as the correct way to publish to PyPI. I had to check PEP740 to make sure it was not directly supported by Microsoft.
&gt; The generation and publication of attestations happens by default, and no changes are necessary for projects that meet all of these conditions: publish from GitHub Actions; via Trusted Publishing; and use the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action to publish.
If you then click on &quot;The manual way&quot; it adds a big disclaimer:
&gt; STOP! You probably don&#x27;t need this section; it exists only to provide some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading work. If you&#x27;re an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the official workflows described above.
Where the only official workflow is &quot;Use GitHub Actions&quot;.
I guess I am an idealist but as a maintainer this falls short of my expectations  for the openness of Python and PyPI.</span>

&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; The Onion, with the help of the Sandy Hook families, has purchased InfoWars.
&gt; We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website.
&gt; We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off.
&gt; I can&#x27;t wait to show you what we have cooked up.

                              <span>This is one of the few HN articles that have profoundly moved me. Such a beautiful and simple use of technology to make a clear and big improvement in someone&#x27;s life.
As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP&#x27;s mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who&#x27;d been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn&#x27;t remember the game. OP&#x27;s mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.</span>

This reminds me of a desire I&#x27;ve had for a long time: a simple, wall-mountable eInk device that could be configured with a URL (+wifi creds) and render a markdown file, refreshing once every hour or so. It would be so useful for so many applications – I&#x27;m a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless. I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple of hundred dollars per device for a solid version of such a thing, if it could be mounted and then recharged every month or two.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Billing alerts&quot; are a joke, give us hard spend limits. Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.
Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It&#x27;s also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, &quot;I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life&#x27;s savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they&#x27;re coming for my house&quot;, the less they&#x27;ll want to explore your offerings.</span>

                              <span>Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!
Here&#x27;s a start --
&quot;Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc&quot;: No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
&quot;Who uses Keras in production&quot;: Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn&#x27;t all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
&quot;Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019&quot;: I didn&#x27;t! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!</span>

                              <span>Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China&#x27;s income level. We quantify China&#x27;s consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country&#x27;s production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. See the (...)

                              <span>U.S. household debt balances grew by $147 billion (0.8 percent) over the third quarter, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data. Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.</span>

🔬Small web has divided my career life as an indie developer to two phases:
My life before knowing about small web
And my life after knowing it.
What is the small web?
My quick, not complete answer, using an example: Personal websites/blogs people are making and hosting themselves are part of the small web.
You can find many of these websites here:
https://blogroll.org
🔆 You can start learning more about the small web by visiting these websites and keep clicking the links inside them to start a never ending journey into the small web 🐇🕳rabbit hole👇
Learn anything about the small web movement
you can find lots of resources and links to small web projects on this page:

And here in this page Aral, the developer of Kitten (One of the best full stack’s for creating small web apps), talks about the small web.
“I confess I fell in love with Kitten from the moment I saw it - You can learn more about Kitten in the link bellow”

There&#x27;s a lot to untangle into where I ended up and how and why, and the sense of lingering impermanence that&#x27;s run through this year. But that doesn&#x27;t matter right now. What does matter is that I met a lot of weird little guys and I want to share them with you.
There&#x27;s good cats out there. Take a pet no problem.
Tove (Edinburgh, UK)
Tove is not my cat, but she is the cat I live with. She&#x27;s also less a cat than some kind of cross between a small bird and a meringue, making her strange little chirps for attention all hours of the day. She used to be a terribly shy and anxious thing but has grow…</span>

                              <span>Maybe ten years ago, I read a blog post by, I think, a French company called snips, that explained how their app used the pressure sensor to detect when the train entered or leaved a station. It turned out there was a very clear signal due to the sudden pressure increase or decrease when the train entered or left the tunnel between the stations.

                              <span>I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.
The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who&#x27;s behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who&#x27;s ahead can be nurtured.
We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t be&quot; was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It&#x27;s such a crying shame.</span>

                              <span>One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn&#x27;t one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don&#x27;t have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it&#x27;s fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that&#x27;s okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don&#x27;t want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!</span>

                              <span>Note: This one has an HN thread.
I lost a Stripe dispute of USD $210 because the customer that purchased tickets from my site used an email that he claimed to his bank was not his. Stripe and the bank asked me to provide evidence that this wasn&#x27;t fraudulent and I sent them:
The invoice sent to the email the customer entered
The actual tickets that were sent
Despite this evidence I lost the dispute because of the customer&#x27;s &quot;it wasn&#x27;t me&quot; defense. Here&#x27;s Bank of America&#x27;s response:
Compelling documents shows name is matching with customer, but email id and ip address does not match with our customer. No
proof our customer benefited from this transaction. Our customer maintains charge is unauthorized/fraud.
This is a lie because I never even sent them the IP address since that isn&#x27;t shown in…</span>
