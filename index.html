                              <span>Feeling melancholic.
I don&#x27;t know what it is. It could be the rain, or it could be because it&#x27;s Monday. Either way, I&#x27;m feeling all the feels today1. I&#x27;m currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather&#x27;s got a mood, and it&#x27;s contagious.
I love the sound of rain. I think it&#x27;s soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it&#x27;s Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.
Maybe it&#x27;s just one of those days. I&#x27;ve done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.
And so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don&#x27;t quite know what to do with just yet.
That&#x27;s all.

It&#x27;s snowing in Eastern Canada! 🤩❄️

It’s a wet day here too. A sort of stead drizzle that just envelops everything in tiny teardrops. Hope you feel less melancholy tomorrow and maye, the sun will come out.

Then again, it&#x27;s been like this more so since a week ago.↩


Today, I got the coffee covered. Blankets, reading and nap will have to wait since I have to work.↩</span>

                              <span>hareket her şeydir, nihai hedef hiçbir şeydir. — eduard bernstein
to-do listlerimin çoğu artık to-think olarak değişmiş vaziyette. serbest çağrışım tabii.
bunu bir üşengeçlik olarak göreceklerin kokusunu buradan alıyorum. bunu bir üşengeçlik, tembellik, zararlı davranış, “öyle olmaz”cılık olarak alanlar oldu, hayatımın her döneminde.
onur ile ocak’ta ikinci senesini dolduracak olan aralıksız her çarşamba oturup en az üç fikir üzerine düşünmelerimizi feyzalarak bir şeyler karalamak istedim. üzerine yoğunlaştığımız bir iş yokken de varken de disiplinli olarak her çarşamba günü, büyük olasılıkla öğlen 12:00 civarında, en az 1 saat boyunca, yoğun bir şekilde odaklanmanın ne demek olduğunu, bu odaklanma halinin işin kendisini yapmaktan ne kadar daha fayadalı olduğunu, çağdaş toplumun yapmaktan …</span>

                              <span>It’s a lazy Sunday morning, September 2015, in Bangalore. The city’s atmosphere makes everyone a little sluggish. Deciding to shake off the weekend haze, I went out and found myself wandering the streets of BTM. Suddenly, a small shop caught my eye, filled to the brim with books—as if there were no bricks in the walls, only shelves and stacks of paperbacks and hardcovers. Curiosity got the better of me, and I stepped inside, calling out to see if anyone was there. An old, weathered hand raised itself from behind a towering pile, and a soft, respectful voice answered, “What do you want, sir?”
Startled, I scanned the room until I spotted an old man in the midst of this sea of books. “Hi,” I replied. “Is this a library or an old bookshop?” He chuckled and explained that it was a private libra…</span>

                              <span>I am from south India where a lot of wild elephants roam the villages and towns. When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.</span>

My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.

The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.

                              <span>Happy Sunday:) just popping in to let you know I&#x27;ve added Monstrous Existence vol. 3 to the shop this morning.
It&#x27;s a one-page (double-sided) zine about being saddened by the election results, needing a break, starting a new sketchbook, + a mini music list, doodles, and scattered thoughts.
This zine is a limited print of 30 copies. Each copy has red marker accents that are unique to each print.
Made with love ❤︎</span>

&gt; These videos come from YouTube. They were uploaded in the last week and have titles like DSC 1234 and IMG 4321. They have almost zero previous views. They are unnamed, unedited, and unseen (by anyone but you).

A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife&#x27;s edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump&#x27;s 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

                              <span>My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple&#x27;s ads for &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they&#x27;re unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband&#x27;s birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly &quot;save the day&quot; by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife&#x27;s case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That&#x27;s part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won&#x27;t make us more perfect. The more we expect &quot;perfection&quot; from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.</span>

The days are long but the years are short
-Gretchen Rubin
I think Gretchen Rubin forgot to talk about the weeks in between. This week has been both difficult, and heartbreaking. I honestly am still not done processing everything post-election. My heart has been heavy, and I cannot shake the sadness that seems to have permanently enveloped my soul.
Let’s talk about this week anyways.
📖 We went back to Barnes and Noble last Saturday to finally pick up the most beautiful edition of my favorite book The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I already have the paperback version but this hardback is absolutely stunning.
📖 LC picked up a collectible edition of The Great Gatsby and Other Classic Works. This one also has a stunning white and go…</span>

I&#x27;ve been noticed online, which is surprising. Scott Jack is the person in question to notice me, indeed he wrote a reply to my blogpost on what I learnt about Bearblog. He raises some good points about one specific section of the post - that being, the part where I mention that I wish there were comment sections.
Maybe I&#x27;m too used to seeing comment sections, what with me growing up in a generation that uses Instagram and TikTok like they&#x27;re vitamin supplements, and comments come naturally with them. The same goes with blogs, before Bearblog almost every post I saw came with one embedded. That&#x27;s not to say blogs with comment sections are better, …</span>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown. 
 Wolfe describes such charter cities as “special economic economic zones that are still bound by criminal law but able to create their own c…</span>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine
In the past this was easily available, with the most popular brand being Sudafed. My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.
Pseudoephedrine is very effective. It is also used to synthesize the somewhat related illegal drug methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;). Historically, meth manufacturers would hire people to buy large amounts of pseudoephedrine pil…</span>

This is a satirical paper. Because pseudoephedrine (i.e. the good decongestant) is very difficult to obtain due to restrictions, but &quot;N-methylamphetamine can be procured at almost any time on short notice&quot;, the paper describes how to synthesize pseudoephedrine from meth with a procedure that looks valid.

QNX has been &quot;opened&quot; twice before. Each time, there was a rug pull, and it went closed again.
Before the first rug pull, open source groups routinely added QNX to their target list. There was a Firefox for QNX. Eclipse had QNX as a target. GCC and most of the Gnu command line tools could be built for QNX.
There was a desktop environment, Photon. I used that as a primary desktop for three years when working on a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle.
All of that went away after the Harman acquisition of QNX in 2004.
Then, in 2007, QNX went open source. You could even look at the microkernel. It wasn&#x27;t openly licensed, but you could look inside and build it.
In 2010, RIM acquired QNX, and, with no warning, closed the source. All open source development related to QNX…</span>

                              <span>I have had the worst migraines the past couple of weeks (months?). As someone who suffers from chronic migraines (for the past 15+ years), I track my headaches and migraines to ensure that the latest medications I’m on are actually working.
In the past month, I’ve had 13 migraines, and a few headaches.
These migraines are absolutely debilitating. Some of them included a migraine aura1, while a few did not. During these times, if I’m lucky, all I need to do is ensure I am in a dark enough room, take my abortive migraine medication, follow my usual migraine self-care routine, and hope the pain passes quickly enough. If I’m not so lucky, then nausea also comes into the picture. I’ll spare you the details because that’s just messy.
When these attacks happen during the weekend, I’m typically ju…</span>

Yes, my glasses are taped because I&#x27;m still recovering from rhinoplasty and need to alleviate pressure off my nose.

For those who want to know:
20 sessions of laser + 4 sessions of electrolysis. Still slightly grey on upper and lower lip and continuing laser. I started Progesterone on month five instead of month six--and I shouldn&#x27;t have. I was simply hurting too much and trying to rush the process. Cyproterone as T-blocker and patches for Estrogen. I&#x27;m not giving the amounts here because that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important--it&#x27;s your blood level concentration for T and E that you should be looking at.
Thinking I would at least like to be one cup bigger in breast growth!
Everyone tells me to imagine where I&#x27;ll be in three years time and in all honesty, I don&#x27;t even know where I&#x27;ll be next year. I try not to think too far ahead now and just stay in the moment. :)
Ew-phoria moment: got checked out by a group of four men in a very uncomfortable way that made me run off. No thank you.
Weird moments: suddenly being asked out in the past two weeks and having crushes admitted to me by a few friends and I had to quickly and politely--but firmly--turn them down. Sorry, I&#x27;m very much taken.</span>

                              <span>I recently received an email from a reader of my blog asking about my process for building things.
I was wondering if you&#x27;d be willing to share your workflow for building products. At big companies, we&#x27;d usually do a lot of planning with diagrams, documentation, etc before building anything. I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when it comes to building a new products. Seeing how you&#x27;ve built some nice tools like Bear Blog, I wanted to hear from you personally.
I&#x27;ve built a lot of things over the past 10 years. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, with a few of them becoming actual products that fund the rest of my tinkering.
My approach to building products is more akin to a gardener than to a product developer. I play around with ideas, follow interesting threads, and see where the p…</span>

                              <span>Instead of the laser focus on TikTok as a threat, it would be better for the US and Canada to have real data protection laws that would apply equally to TikTok, Meta, Google, Apple, and X. What the EU has done is far from perfect but it bans the worst practices. The Chinese can buy all of the information they want on Americans and Canadians from ad brokers, who will happily sell them everything they need to track individuals&#x27; locations.
Perhaps the way to get anti-regulation politicians on board with this is for someone to do what was done to Robert Bork and legally disclose lots of personal info on members of Congress/Parliament, obtained from data brokers and de-anonymized.</span>

Response: Actually, here is the correct definition of &quot;inflation.&quot; As you can see from the correct definition, inflation rates are now good! Hopefully this helps you understand why things will never get better.
What the average voter hears: I can&#x27;t afford groceries. Your solution to this problem is to reframe the current situation as &quot;good.&quot; I still can&#x27;t afford groceries.</span>

-Inflation is not prices; it is the rate of change in prices.  Low inflation doesn&#x27;t imply low prices.
-Aggregate statistics don&#x27;t necessarily explain individual outcomes.
The Dems failed on this count massively, and have, for maybe the last 40 years, which is about the amount of time it took for my state to go from national bellwether (As goes Ohio, so goes the nation) to a reliably red state.  This cost one of the most pro-union Senators (Sherrod Brown) his job.</span>

The biggest issue on people&#x27;s minds was the economy. Dem messaging on economic policy was nonexistent. Women&#x27;s healthcare isn&#x27;t an issue that resonates with young (read: unmarried) men. It should, but it doesn&#x27;t. There could have been some &quot;look out for your wife&quot; messaging, but there wasn&#x27;t.
There&#x27;s a lot of people in the comments parroting whatever narrative they cooked up for 2016, but the reality is that both candidates&#x27; approaches were wildly different this time around.</span>

                              <span>From a game theoretical perspective this is a good result. It is a clear reiteration of the message to the Democrats: you won&#x27;t win by claiming to be 0.1% less bad.
The Democrats should have fielded a strong personality in their own right. This is not about left or right. It&#x27;s about mobilizing people by giving them something to care about. &quot;More of the same&quot; and &quot;not like that guy&quot; isn&#x27;t very enticing.
I don&#x27;t think the policy positions even matter that much, if you can make a strong case and gain the confidence of the electorate.</span>

It’s also interesting that you served in the U.S. military and didn’t recognize how self-serving and institutionally corrupt it is. I come from a country with an oversized military relative to its government, and the parallels I can draw between its behavior and that of the U.S. Army are uncanny.</span>

I&#x27;m not in any way better as a human being than my friends working in construction. Quite the contrary, their job is far more important to society than mine. If I stopped my niche research tomorrow, no one would really care. If handymen, farmers, or truckers stopped working, there would be riots.
Also, the DNC should really stop forcing unwanted candidates down people&#x27;s throats. It doesn&#x27;t work, even when you spam social platforms with your narrative.</span>

                              <span>I remember living in a different country as a child, hearing everyone talk about a faraway place called America.
Everyone wanted to go to America. The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.
Even as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.
America was the place to be. We would get freedom there.
That was a long time ago.
Now, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.
Today, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.
I am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).
I went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.
A lot will change over these next 4 years.
Be kind to your loved ones today.
Many of us need it.

                              <span>Even if no one reads your blog, the act of writing it is clarifying, motivating and (eventually) fun. — Seth Godin
I tell myself that I blog for my own sake.
I write to express, to put thoughts out there for my own reflection.
I publish essays because it helps me tame my thinking.
And yet, that tiny toast button somehow becomes a bigger deal than it actually is.
I’d be lying if I say I don’t check the stats.
I’m a numbers guy, drawn to tracking things: expenses, books, movies, runs, etc.
Views and upvotes...
..just another metric to follow, a survey on whether anyone&#x27;s reading.
A measure of... something I&#x27;m not sure anymore.
Writing has been my outlet, a habit I’ve had an on-off relationship with over the years.
In all my reasons for writing, I mostly write for myself.
I agree with Mr. Godin -- writing is clarifying, motivating and fun, even if no one&#x27;s reading.
But I&#x27;ll admit, it feels good knowing someone else is out there nodding along, connecting to a piece I&#x27;ve shared.
Imagining that somewhere, a stranger reads my words in their own quiet corner, maybe in pajamas, maybe over coffee, and smiles, resonates, or even feels a spark of recognition.
To me, that’s inspiring.
So, even if nobody reads my blog, the act of sharing still matters.
My writing is still deeply personal, a habit of expression and reflection.
And if, by chance, someone wanders in this corner of the web, that connection, however fleeting, is simply a bonus.</span>

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>What comes across from the article to me is the class barrier more than the gender one - basically it&#x27;s a posh person finding out what the &quot;real world&quot; looks like.
Shop talk and banter are fairly universal. Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn&#x27;t look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not.
The other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics. In academia and in highbrow society the tendency is to basically sanitise every social interaction. When you&#x27;re in an environment where that isn&#x27;t happening then you can&#x27;t suddenly ignore it any more.</span>
