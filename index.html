                              <span>Getting elites attention

What the right wants from its followers is for them to be riven by hatred of any difference, thus making them easy to manipulate and willing to sell out their economic values in exchange for seeing brown people beaten, and women and trans people losing control over their own bodies.
What neoliberals want is for their followers to be convinced that each group, even each micro group, is on its own, unable to understand each other and thus that solidarity is impossible and all one can hope for is that some member of the identity group is allowed to join the elite, while most of all groups remain in poverty.
They’re very similar, really. In both cases hatred of other groups is inculcated as the core value, as a way of making manipulation easy and avoiding having to actually deal with broad issues of well being.
Both of these are variations on “divide and conquer”. It costs a lot less to give a few people something than to give many people something. “Want some women and minorities in power? Sure. Costs us almost nothing.”
“Want women to be forced to bear rape children and die in pregnancy due to lack of necessary abortions? Sure, costs us nothing. Our women can still get abortions.
“Want trans people excluded and denied health care? Sure, they’re a tiny part of the population and rich trans people will be fine.”
On the other hand giving everyone healthcare would cut a lot of profits. Giving everyone a liveable wage or assistance to those who can’t work or find jobs: that would cost a lot of profits.
“You can have anything you want, as long as it doesn’t make elites poorer.”
On that the right and center are unified.

                              <span>Stumbled on this chart recently:

Kind of tells its own story.
It’s worth reading the Communist manifest. People have weird ideas about it, but a lot of it is really unexceptionable. For example, Marx and Engels demanded pensions for old folks.
Capitalists looked at this and said, “oh, we can do this if the alternative is worse” and introduced them. Someone as hard headed as Bismarck responded this way.
The threat of a credible enemy ideology which treats ordinary people better than capitalists do forces capitalists to change. For a long time we haven’t had that, but the single party “Marxist but with capitalism” CCP offers another, and yes, they do, overall treat their workers better, as well as being better at capitalism than capitalists. No one is as obsessed with how markets actually work as Marxist economists.
Let’s look at another of my favorite charts:

Oh hey, having powerful organizations taking the part of workers matters.
Something happened right after Reagan took power:

Strikes involving more than 1,000 workers

Then there’s this:

(The numbers have gone down since then, but are still vastly high, and far, far higher than China.
Break the unions and lock up the people who won’t obey bullshit (aka. drug) laws.
Class war is real, and constantly ongoing, and elites have won that war.
Power and fear is all that capitalists ever respond to.
Always remember that.

Downstream services also will have the option to process and respond to events originating within the system or not.</span>

                              <span>Well, maybe. Who the hell knows what he’ll do. Anyway, tariffs are back to 10% on either side and negotiations will continue.
Note that China got what they wanted, minus 10%—no negotiations until the tariffs are removed.
There will still be a two month trade burp. Ships weren’t leaving China for the US at all, literally zero. Lot of freight companies are about to make a mint, though. So expect some shortages, but nothing worse than Covid, and hopefully lasting less time.
The fundamental problem remains, however, which is that there’s no certainty around any of this, so business people can’t make long term plans, including plans to build or relocate manufacturing. Trump and the US can’t be trusted to stay steady on policy, so avoiding making big plans involving the US makes sense.
The Great Power picture is clearer, however. The US tried to impose its will on China and failed. China wouldn’t negotiate till its pre-conditions were met. The world has two great powers, with the EU bidding to become the third (I think they’ll fail, but that’s what the rearmament is about.)
And, in economic terms, China is by far the pre-eminent great power. It isn’t even close. The era of American hegemony is officially over. The US tried to impose its will on the world and failed.

So, the Europeans have said that Russia must grant an unconditional 30 day ceasefire, or they’ll ramp up aid to Ukraine and put on more sanctions, including some against Nord Stream II. They claim Trump is onside, but Trump hasn’t confirmed this.
The Russians have indicated willingness for a thirty day ceasefire, but they have a condition: for those thirty days, weapon shipments from the West to Ukraine must stop and Putin has straight up rejected the unconditional ceasefire.
What a surprise.
What Europeans want is for Russia, which is winning on the ground, to give them thirty days to rearm Ukraine. Can’t imagine why Russia won’t go for that.
The Euros are delusional. They have no leverage. They’ve already said they intend to end all energy purchases from Russia …</span>

Congressman Casten: Trump’s Assault on the Rule of Law Is Causing Capital Flight Out of U.S. by Foreign Investors
Pam Martens and Russ Martens, May 5, 2025 [Wall Street on Parade]
Last Wednesday, Congressman Sean Casten, Democrat of Illinois, stated the following in an open meeting of the House Financial Services Committee:
“For the first time in my memory, foreign investors are not only fleeing U.S. equities but are fleeing U.S. Treasuries. I met with banks last week – banks under our jurisdiction – who said that the international community is putting a risk premium on investments in the United States because of regulatory risk and because they question whether the rule of law that they depend on …</span>

This post is for a Russian friend of mine. Руфина Сергеевна Гашева, Rufina Sergeyevna Gasheva was born 14 October 1921. Ruffik, as she asked me to call her–was proud to have a young American friend. I have a stack of letters to prove it.
I met Ruffik back in 2002. I was in Moscow with my soon to be wife and her best friend, Nastya (diminutive of Anastasia). Nastya dearly wanted to see her babushka, which was the last thing I wanted to do. Hear stories from some old lady? Good grief. But I went to keep my wife-to-be happy. One of the best decisions I ever made. After meeting Cpl. Ed Neidermeir of the 42 Division (aka: Rainbow Division) who saw his first action on 16 June 1918, meeting Ruffik an…</span>
