                              <span>It&#x27;s SUCH a win that they managed to roll this out to a small set of tax situations and states to start. Every government project I&#x27;ve been on has required creativity in defining an MVP that doesn&#x27;t include shipping to everyone. This was cited consistently as one of the great successes of this project, they were able to ship something that successfully filed 150k taxes b/c they were able to scope things down to something doable in 9 months.</span>

                              <span>Are they just banking on people not caring enough or knowing about the refund process? Clearly it can&#x27;t be better off for them to refund hundreds of thousands maybe even 1m+ people.
We need laws that step in to make this impossible. Hardware should be designed so that it can be reused. Make it so that people can just reflash the memory at a minimum. There&#x27;s no reason for something like this to become e-waste. And the excuse being Spotify wanting to protect their brand should not stand.</span>

                              <span>The term “open access” is misleading and carefully engineered to generate good will, when in fact it should be termed “pay to publish” (as argued quite nicely by Brian McGill [1]). As it stands today, OA is mostly a public money sink, a big scheme to drain public money from European countries. Not only are we paying a ridiculous, ungodly amount of money for people to host PDFs on a website, but the entire idea of publishers competing for the quality of their research output (in order to get submissions) has also basically been eradicated and turned meaningless. Reviewers are pushed to accept papers instead of rejecting them, because a rejected paper makes no money, and now we are left with a deluge of noise that passes for scientific literature. I sincerely pity the PhD student who needs to run a serious, systematic literature review in 2024. Hell sounds more attractive.
If you want open access, ditch the publishers and fund volunteer expert communities to edit and publish their own papers. You can’t have the cake and eat it too.

                              <span>A lot of this resonates. I&#x27;m not in Antartica, I&#x27;m in Beijing, but still struggle with the internet. Being behind the great firewall means using creative approaches. VPNs only sometimes work, and each leaves a signature that the firewall&#x27;s hueristics and ML can eventually catch onto. Even state-mandated ones are &#x27;gently&#x27; limited at times of political sensitivity. It all ends up meaning that, even if I get a connection, it&#x27;s not stable, and it&#x27;s so painful to sink precious packets into pointless web-app-react-crap roundtrips.
I feel like some devs need to time-travel back to 2005 or something and develop for that era in order to learn how to build things nimbly. In deficit of time travel, if people could just learn to open web tools and use its throttling tool: turn it to 3g, and see if their webapp is resilient. Please!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean for the rest of my life. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!

                              <span>One of the core responsibilities of central banks is to act as “lender of last resort” to the financial system. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has been operating as a lender of last resort through its “discount window” (DW) for more than a century. Historically, however, the DW has been plagued by stigma—banks’ reluctance to use the DW, even for benign reasons, out of concerns that it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness. In this post, we report on new research showing that once a DW facility is stigmatized, removing that stigma is difficult.</span>

However, getting started in the field can be daunting if you don’t know much about the preparation you’ll need and the available job opportunities. If you’re wondering what it means to be an economics researcher or how to become one, please read on. We’ll review how to prepare for a career in economics research, what an economics PhD program entails, and what types of opportunities it might bring. Economic education is a core component of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s mission to serve the community. To empower would-be economists, this post provides information for students who seek a career in economics research.

                              <span>Fifty-seven years ago during the Six-Day War (June 8, 1967), Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) brutally attacked a U.S. naval intelligence ship that was seconded to the National Security Agency (NSA) for intercepting communications in the Middle East.  Thirty-four American sailors were killed in the attack, and 171 were wounded by unmarked Mirage fighter aircraft using cannons and rockets.  Israeli boats fired machine guns at close range at those helping the wounded, including a Soviet naval vessel that was trying to rescue U.S. sailors; they also machine-gunned life rafts that survivors had dropped in hopes of abandoning the ship.  The Israelis immediately called the disaster a “random accident.” It wasn’t “random” and it wasn’t an “accident,” but the NSA investigation of the assault remains classified to this day.

But much Democratic opposition exists in the form of incentives for green energy industries, for example, those built into the Inflation Reduction Act. In terms of actually holding climate polluters accountable, other than Biden’s budgetary proposal to end tax breaks (which is, after all, only a proposal), and a pause on natural gas permits, Democratic challenges have come in the form of “homework assignments for companies, and requests for Justice Department investigations,” wrote Axios reporter Ben German.

In the months since then, she has not only quit her job, but also somehow gotten engaged AND married (in a courthouse wedding) without telling any of us. What is going on? Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven&#x27;t even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.
This is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I&#x27;ll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through &#x27;husband&#x27; will catch in my mouth and &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; will slip out instead.
Most of this can be chalked up to unfamiliarity. I&#x27;ve been u…</span>

                              <span>I have seen Will Larson&#x27;s techniques applied/ forced in multiple organizations and have found that his view of the engineering world just does not work. I sense that there is a cult of personality around him that leads to engineering ivory towers.
Most orgs that I&#x27;ve seen follow his writing or ideas have ended up in conflict with the business and one another, isolated on a corporate island, and then gutted by layoffs.
I don&#x27;t like to throw an author/engineer under the bus but I do not know why this guy has a following. I have never seen his methods result in happy engineers and delivered value.
My summary of this article (for managers):
1. Micromanage early and often
2. Measure, and whatever you&#x27;re measuring, act like it&#x27;s truth and that you know best.
3. Listen to the curmudgeons and the naysayers because they are the true sources of knowledge.
Edit- as I mention in a reply, try https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-dev... Ron Jeffries&#x27; &quot;The Nature of Software Development&quot;. Incremental value, engineers leading delivery, constant feedback cycles, flexibility. I&#x27;ve followed the tenets of this book in many orgs, and they lead to measurable value, happy engineers, and successful orgs.</span>

I would kind of appreciate having two formats, since what are the odds they would change together? While there may never be a 3rd format, a DRY importer would imply that the source generating the data is also DRY.</span>

Oh no, more of this.
What about less used options? How much slower? How much less discoverable?
Desktop applications are already for power users almost by definition, let’s not slow them down for the sake of reducing “clutter”. Absolutely annoying trend of the last 15 years or so.</span>

                              <span>GraphQL absolutely feels like a technological solution to an organizational problem. What if your front-end team wants to write crazy queries and your back-end team wants to build their resume doing Real Engineering, but what you actually need is just a CRUD app?
Now your backend devs aren&#x27;t bored writing &quot;business logic&quot; and your front end devs aren&#x27;t bored waiting for your backend devs. You have a new class of inscrutable errors and performance issues, but that&#x27;s why you pay your backend devs the big bucks! Because some guys from a technical college couldn&#x27;t possibly solve your issue, you need to pay 250k to people who went to Stanford or Berkeley.</span>

                              <span>I bought into the hype and I feel bad for the company where I implemented it. One true endpoint to rule them all and cause endless headaches in the process.
With most tech that I screw up I assume that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t using it right&quot; but with GraphQL I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could. The permissions/auth aspect alone is a nightmare. Couple that with potential performance issues (N+1 or just massive amounts of data) and I want nothing to do with GraphQL anymore. Everything we attempted to fix our permissions issues just caused more problems. It would break existing queries and debugging GraphQL sucked so much.
If you only live on the frontend and someone else is responsible for the backend GraphQL then I understand why you might like it. From that perspective it&#x27;s amazing, you can get as little or as much as you want with the specific fields you want. No waiting on the backend team to write an endpoint. However even then you end up saving queries as files or abstracting them (maybe IDE support has improved but it wasn&#x27;t great last time I was using it ~5 years ago) and now you just have REST endpoints by another name.
At one point we considered whitelisting specific queries and that&#x27;s when I knew we had gone too far and made a mess for ourselves. If we had taken the time to just write REST endpoints instead we would have gotten way more done and had way fewer grey hairs.</span>

                              <span>One of the #1 issues I’ve seen with DRY over the years seems to stem from a misunderstanding of what it means.
DRY is not just about code duplication, it’s about information/knowledge duplication, and code happens to be one representation of information.
Hyper focusing on code duplication quickly gets into premature optimization territory, and can result in DRYing things that don’t make sense. Focusing on information duplication leaves some leeway for the code and helps identify which parts of the code actually need DRY.
The difference is important, and later editions of the Pragmatic Programmer call this out specifically. But the concept of DRY often gets a bit twisted in my experience.</span>

I&#x27;d prioritize cohesion over extensibility. When people talk about best practices, they don&#x27;t talk about how a lot of them are incompatible, or at least at odds with each other. Writing code is about choosing the best practices you want to prioritize as much as it&#x27;s about avoiding bad practices.</span>

                              <span>I ran a multi-million dollar a year non-profit and had a full-time job. It&#x27;s not unusual to chair or &quot;run&quot; a non-profit and have a regular job, non-profits are actually set up to make this easy to do. If that non-profit somehow mystically turned into a for-profit enterprise, for a multitude of reasons (some less obvious) I would have clearly had to pick one or the other. If said non-profit had commercialized transformer as a service, I&#x27;d have quit DigitalOcean (double so if I was well vested).
Just to make it fair with the situation: I honestly don&#x27;t know if I would have proactively quit one or the other. Depending on the workloads, I may very well have tried to moonlight both for a while, I&#x27;m unsure.

                              <span>Worked on two GraphQL projects; I was quickly cured from the hype. I recognize a lot of points in this article.
In both these projects the GraphQL had started small. I came in during a more mature phase of these projects (2 and 4 years). That&#x27;s where the requirements are harder, more specific, and overall complexity has grown. Adoption and demand on the API were growing quickly. Hence you logically spend more time debugging, this is true for any codebase.
But GraphQL has everything in it to make such problems even harder. And both these projects had clear signs of &quot;learning-on-the-go&quot; with loads of bad practices (especially for the N+1 problem). Issue descriptions were much vaguer, harder to find in logs and performance issues popped up in the most random places (code that had been running and untouched for ages).
Fun fact; in both these projects the original devs who set it up were no longer involved. Probably spreading their evangalism further elsewhere.
RPC and REST are just more straightforward to monitor, log, cache, authorize and debug.</span>

                              <span>A lot of people here bending over backwards to try to interpret this maximally negatively.
Probably because the &quot;Sam Altman is an amoral, power hungry mastermind who was run out of all his previous gigs&quot; is a more interesting narrative than whatever is actually happening.</span>

                              <span>This seems silly. It’s been obvious even to casual observers like myself for years that Waymo/Google was one of the only groups taking the problem seriously and trying to actually solve it, as opposed to pretending you could add self-driving with just cameras in an over-the-air update (Tesla), or trying to move fast and break things (Uber), or pretending you could gradually improve lane-keeping all the way into autonomous driving (car manufacturers). That’s why it’s working for them. (IIUC, Cruise has pretty much also always been legit?)
Don’t even get me started on the “didn’t take psych 102: Attention and Memory”-level cluelessness required to believe a human can safely pay attention well enough in a vehicle that reliably tricks you into believing it’s autonomous to take over in the split seconds before a disaster…
I find it hard to believe that the Tesla and Auto Manufacturer positions aren’t knowingly deceptive. I mean, what are they going to say? “It’s too hard so we’re just waiting for Waymo or Cruise to license their tech once it works”?
I’m gonna stop here before I start mocking geohot… I seriously can’t believe the journalists who wrote those early stories were willing to risk their lives like that…</span>

 The first impression produced upon a stranger by a village in Great Russia is undoubtedly gloomy. The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. 
 The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes. Sometimes, when f…</span>

 Much has been written lately in condemnation of the free libraries, on the ground that they were chiefly used by those who cared only for light reading, and that the more serious books were rarely in demand. It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…</span>

 THE Russian educated woman is known to some extent in this country for the part which she took in the struggles for political freedom. Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. 
 If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…</span>

 THE necessity of growing more foodstuffs in this country has perhaps never been so evident as it is now. That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming? Could not, let us say, several County Councils, especially in those counties where there are patches of a lighter soil, establish a number of sm…</span>

 The train had just arrived at the station of N—–, an out-of-the-way place on one of the branches of the South-Eastern system. The few travellers alighted—three men and a woman—and stood on the platform, waiting till the way was deal- to cross to the other side and make their way out. 
 The men belonged in the vicinity and knew each other. They talked together, while the woman—a young brunette, thin and poorly dressed in black—stood apart, leaning on the railing. Her eyes roved over the surrounding country and seemed to s…</span>

I wake up, do what I have to do to keep my scholarship and my body in decent condition, and go to sleep. Repeat. My days have a rhythm I don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy, because college life is the same stressful day over and over again, with a little respite here and there. And it&#x27;s like, God, I&#x27;m 20 years old. I should be at the club.
But life goes on regardless, so here I am, at 9 a.m., eating a bowl of thick oatmeal and writing this post. I don&#x27;t know what exactly made me write this. The oatmeal? My 2024 planner slowly approaching the halfway mark? The sunlight filtering through the curtains? Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t have anything to go to today except lunch with a friend. Being able to take it slow in the morning, enough to think about things like this, is rare.
I&#x27;m alive. That&#x27;s something.</span>

                              <span>One of the iron laws of people being creative on the internet is that it’s only a matter of time until the haters arrive.
Yesterday on Twitter, I saw post after post mocking the increasing popularity of bearblog, the “bear”-bones blogging platform that simply gives people a blank slate and lets them go at it. One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. &quot;Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...&quot;
To the contrary - I&#x27;m loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.
In this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest. Amidst it all, bearblog stands tall as a quiet, &quot;old-internet&quot; venue -- a corner of the web well worth preserving.</span>

                              <span>I recently read Kristin&#x27;s post where she notes that a lot of blogs have a very serious tone to them, and laughed because it was something I clocked too, at least in my own posting behavior recently!
I think I naturally like to reflect, but I&#x27;d noticed that whenever I came on here, I found myself endeavoring to write Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter1, because a lot of the posts I read were (either intentionally or naturally) Thoughtful Posts about Realizations and Things That Matter. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but I&#x27;m happy for the reminder to unclench. Honestly, I personally prefer reading the day-to-day, thesis-less stuff myself.2

                              <span>I recently came across a tweet that rubbed me the wrong way.
It stated: &quot;Mediocre people often have a clear tell: you&#x27;ll often see them hanging out with other mediocre people, probably because the A+ folks avoid them.&quot;
This reeks of the kind of elitist, self-congratulatory attitude that plagues certain circles. Who determines what makes someone &quot;mediocre&quot; or an &quot;A+&quot;? By what metrics are we judging the worth and value of human beings? The premise that accomplished people inherently avoid those deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; is flawed and perpetuates an unhealthy way of viewing the world and those around us.
Excellence has nothing to do with shutting others out or surrounding yourself with a self-selected elite group. In fact, I would argue the most exceptional people seek out a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds. They don&#x27;t just associate with some narrowly defined cohort of &quot;A+ folks.&quot; The insinuation that the company you keep is the mark of your mediocrity is short-sighted at best.
Perhaps this tweet was merely an attempt at provocation...
 and I&#x27;ve all fallen for the bait.</span>

This topic is always so alarmist.  I have kids and a spouse.  We all have Find My and Location Sharing on our phones.  I don&#x27;t FrEaK oUt that my kids are going to die if I&#x27;m not tracking their every movement.  But it&#x27;s nice to glance at Find My app and see if the kids are still hanging out at Starbucks or they got to school on time.  It&#x27;s convenient to see which corner of the park they&#x27;re at when I need to go pick them up.  I can see if my wife&#x27;s still at Whole Foods and send her a message to pick up baru nuts.  They can see if I&#x27;m still at work or headed home.
This idea of helicopter parents vs free-range glory is a false dichotomy.</span>

This constant tracking of kids is unnecessary and dangerous. Generations of kids survived without their parents needing to know their location at all times.
And yes, I totally admit, some kids (very few actually depending on the locale) didn&#x27;t survive. But we&#x27;ve traded this false sense of &quot;safety&quot; for kids that are so risk averse it is seriously negatively affecting their development. I highly recommend the writings of Jonathan Haidt - he not only has great arguments but also has a lot of data to back up his conclusions.
Kids don&#x27;t need more tech, they need less of it (and FWIW, most adults, too).</span>

                              <span>This mindset assumes that the only measure of success is monetary. If he left Google to try and get richer than staying at Google, then sure, he probably lost.
However, he kept trying again before job hunting or returning to big tech. This tells me the monetary factor was smaller than something else.
You mention the underrated educational experience in your last sentence, but there&#x27;s so much more than that. He was probably never worried about his autonomy, being laid off, working with (or for) people he didn&#x27;t want to work with, corporate politics, or anything else corporate bureaucracy introduces. This likely freed up his brain to be more creative and actually be used to 100% of its capacity.
I believe the obsession with TC in tech is highly problematic and there are a lot of talented folks optimizing for promotions via internal politics, rather than solving real problems for real people.
I also wish healthcare wasn&#x27;t tied to employment, but that&#x27;s a post for another time.</span>

Nevertheless, a narrative has emerged that an observed decline in the share of dollar assets in official reserve portfolios represents the leading edge of the dollar’s loss of status in the international monetary system. Some market participants have similarly linked the apparent increase in official demand for gold in recent years to a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Drawing on recent research and analytics, this post questions these narratives, arguing that these observed aggregate trends largely reflect the behavior of a small number of countries and do not represent a widespread effort by central banks to diversify away from dollars.</span>

The media, the schools, the judges, the cops, politicians, surveillance, technology, work. All have their role to play in repression. [1]
 Concepts and practices such as repression and solidarity have become amorphous and widespread. (I would also add ‘abolition’ to this stack of buzz words, but that might just be my 2p).[2] As with any word that conveniently describes a complex phenomenon (see also gentrification, ‘burn-out’, ‘trauma’, ‘affinity’ etc.) they are both a help and a hindrance. All these words are difficult to discuss because they combine personal experiences with repressive practices deliberatel…</span>

Killing King Abacus
 To Kill King Abacus is to create relations without measure. If we aim to destroy capitalism we cannot reproduce its necrophilic logic which reduces relationships to numbers. To Kill King Abacus is to destroy the social net which privileges mediated transactions and images over direct relations. Because money is a general equivalent and thus is nearly limitless in its applications, it conquers other signifiers of value; capitalism transforms other value systems into itself.

Title: Errico Malatesta: A Brief Biography
Date: 2020
Notes: A brief biographical statement used to preface a reader for the DSA LSC Political Education Working Group&#x27;s Malatesta Reader, which was used in a series of study circles in 2020 to explore Malatesta&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy,&quot; &quot;Towards Anarchy,&quot; and &quot; An Anarchist Programme&quot;.

 Errico Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Italy on 14 December 1853. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II .

                              <span>Recently, I came across a content creator who stated that the antidote to the overconsumption of media content or any sort of information is creation, and it struck a chord with me.
My name is Fatine, I am a 23-year-old student, and that is all you need to know for now.
My consumption tendencies are not unique to me. The fact that Gen Z is a highly connected generation is undeniable, but I have come to the conclusion that it is not something to combat; the aim should be to counterbalance it. One has got to find a good habit that is a byproduct of consumption but makes it profitable. I think writing ticks all the boxes, given the fact that you must absorb a considerable amount of valuable information in order to produce coherently written thoughts.
During these past six months, I went through episodes of overstimulation that triggered the urge to go on long rants about specific topics. These topics were mainly recognized patterns from day-to-day observations and café discussions, all linked, in my opinion, to social media phenomena.

Proponents also cite bitcoin holdings as a portfolio diversification opportunity due to historically low correlation with traditional financial securities. Others argue that bitcoin remains a speculative asset and that ETPs increase its interconnections with the traditional financial system. In this post, we examine the initial performance, trading costs, and price efficiency of spot bitcoin ETPs in the U.S.</span>

Part 1: Anarchist Analysis
Introduction
 We stand now at a turning point, wherein many roads sprawl out in front of us. With unprecedented access to information, the atlas seems to lie within our hands. But, at this crossroads, the popularizers of these many paths shout over one another to persuade new travelers, only to find that most travelers…</span>

Title: Native American Anarchism
Subtitle: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism
Date: 1932
Notes: What is meant by ‘Native American’ in the title is ‘local to America’, not ‘indigenous American’. The text undoubtedly still contains many OCR errors that are hard to find without reading the entire book. Finally, some text appears missing through errors in how the book was originally published, such as a paragraph ends naturally with a period at the end of page 112, but then begins half-way through a sentence at the beginning of page 113 (“exchange and recognized that money”).

Notes: This zine is a transcription of The No State Solution: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon, a live and recorded event which took place on January 22, 2024 in unceded Lekwungen territory in so-called occupied “Victoria, BC, Canada.” While a few grammatical errors have been fixed, we did our best to stay true to the original transcript of our speakers. It is not to be confused with Shuli Branson’s No State Soluton (2023).

 For Soren, 
who taught me the value of a leap. 
 “What we are dealing with here is another version of the Lacanian ‘il n’y a pas de rapport’: if, for Lacan, there is no sexual relationship, then, for Marxism proper, there is no relationship between economy and politics, no meta-language enabling us to grasp the two levels from the same neutral standpoint, although—or, rather, because—these two levels are inextricably intertwined.”

 Democracy has been the American religion since before the Revolution —from New England town halls to the multicultural democracy of Atlantic pirate ships. But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic? And if the tools of our democracy are not working to solve the rising crises we face, how can we —average citizens— make change happen? 
The Democracy Project tells the story of the resilience of the democratic spirit and the adaptability of the democratic idea. It offers a fresh take o…</span>

Notes: In this historical essay the redeemer of the Dutch proletariat is reviewed against the background of his own day and age. Author Rudolf de Jong (born 1932) studied political and social-science, and since 1960 works at the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam. He has published books on the Spanish Civil War and articles on anarchism, Latin America, and Spain. A summary of his essay on Provos and anarchists appeared in the Autumn 1967 issue of Delta. The present article is translated by Elizabeth Wentholt-Haig.

Financed by agribusiness, these advertisements portray a virtuous cycle, showcasing images of contented rural workers amidst soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar cane plantations, as well as happy urban families. They are all content because they can feed, clothe themselves, and fuel their cars, thanks to the agro-industry.

I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine.

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

The negotiations have been difficult. Furthermore, the focus on public health in the Pandemic Agreement remains fragile before the World Health Assembly starting on the 27th of May 2024.

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>
