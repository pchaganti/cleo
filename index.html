                              <span>One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn&#x27;t one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don&#x27;t have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it&#x27;s fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that&#x27;s okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don&#x27;t want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!</span>

The invoice sent to the email the customer entered
The actual tickets that were sent
Despite this evidence I lost the dispute because of the customer&#x27;s &quot;it wasn&#x27;t me&quot; defense. Here&#x27;s Bank of America&#x27;s response:
Compelling documents shows name is matching with customer, but email id and ip address does not match with our customer. No
proof our customer benefited from this transaction. Our customer maintains charge is unauthorized/fraud.
This is a lie because I never even sent them the IP address since that isn&#x27;t shown in the evidence I submitted. Notice…</span>

                              <span>I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.
The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who&#x27;s behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who&#x27;s ahead can be nurtured.
We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t be&quot; was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It&#x27;s such a crying shame.</span>

                              <span>This is great. I particularly liked this observation:
&gt; Shipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.
A lot of the ideas in here resonated with me a lot. This is the kind of article I wish I&#x27;d read before I spent a few years leading an engineering team at a medium-sized tech company!</span>

                              <span>I am from south India where a lot of wild elephants roam the villages and towns. When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.</span>

                              <span>Feeling melancholic.
I don&#x27;t know what it is. It could be the rain, or it could be because it&#x27;s Monday. Either way, I&#x27;m feeling all the feels today1. I&#x27;m currently sitting in my home office, staring out of my balcony door, watching the moody skies cover my neighborhood in a shade of gray. The weather&#x27;s got a mood, and it&#x27;s contagious.
I love the sound of rain. I think it&#x27;s soothing. It always just makes me want to get under the covers, drink a warm cup of coffee, and read (or nap) the day away2. Today, it just reminds me of how quickly the weekend slipped away. I hate that it&#x27;s Monday. Weekends always feel like they end before they even properly start, and now here we are, kicking off another long work week ahead.
Maybe it&#x27;s just one of those days. I&#x27;ve done a bit of analogue journaling already, but I still had a few more words that needed to come out.
And so, here I am, putting words together with feelings that I don&#x27;t quite know what to do with just yet.
That&#x27;s all.

It&#x27;s snowing in Eastern Canada! 🤩❄️

It’s a wet day here too. A sort of stead drizzle that just envelops everything in tiny teardrops. Hope you feel less melancholy tomorrow and maye, the sun will come out.

Then again, it&#x27;s been like this more so since a week ago.↩


Today, I got the coffee covered. Blankets, reading and nap will have to wait since I have to work.↩</span>

                              <span>Vector embeddings by themselves are pretty neat. Binary quantized vector embeddings are extra impressive. In short, they can retain 95+% retrieval accuracy with 32x compression and ~25x retrieval speedup. Let&#x27;s get into how this works and why it&#x27;s so crazy.
What are embeddings?
Embeddings let you turn an arbitrary piece of text into a series of numbers that manage to represent the meaning of the content. These embedding vectors can range in dimension from 512 on the shorter end all the way up to 8192 or more. Typically each of the weights in the vector is represented as a 32-bit floating point number.
LLMs use embeddings to represent input text, but embeddings can also be used on their own.
Embeddings enable you to easily search for pieces of content that have similar meanings by finding t…</span>

My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.


Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiency, you can check some of Polars benchmark here.
I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I&#x27;ve been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization. The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.

It&#x27;s a one-page (double-sided) zine about being saddened by the election results, needing a break, starting a new sketchbook, + a mini music list, doodles, and scattered thoughts.
This zine is a limited print of 30 copies. Each copy has red marker accents that are unique to each print.
Made with love ❤︎</span>

A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife&#x27;s edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump&#x27;s 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

                              <span>My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple&#x27;s ads for &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they&#x27;re unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband&#x27;s birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly &quot;save the day&quot; by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife&#x27;s case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That&#x27;s part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won&#x27;t make us more perfect. The more we expect &quot;perfection&quot; from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.</span>

The days are long but the years are short
-Gretchen Rubin
I think Gretchen Rubin forgot to talk about the weeks in between. This week has been both difficult, and heartbreaking. I honestly am still not done processing everything post-election. My heart has been heavy, and I cannot shake the sadness that seems to have permanently enveloped my soul.
Let’s talk about this week anyways.
📖 We went back to Barnes and Noble last Saturday to finally pick up the most beautiful edition of my favorite book The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I already have the paperback version but this hardback is absolutely stunning.
📖 LC picked up a collectible edition of The Great Gatsby and Other Classic Works. This one also has a stunning white and go…</span>

I&#x27;ve been noticed online, which is surprising. Scott Jack is the person in question to notice me, indeed he wrote a reply to my blogpost on what I learnt about Bearblog. He raises some good points about one specific section of the post - that being, the part where I mention that I wish there were comment sections.
Maybe I&#x27;m too used to seeing comment sections, what with me growing up in a generation that uses Instagram and TikTok like they&#x27;re vitamin supplements, and comments come naturally with them. The same goes with blogs, before Bearblog almost every post I saw came with one embedded. That&#x27;s not to say blogs with comment sections are better, …</span>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown.

                              <span>This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the &quot;aliveness&quot; of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label &quot;life&quot; - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don&#x27;t add anything to the science.
Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell&#x27;s machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?
The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn&#x27;t the case. Lynn Margulis&#x27;s endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that&#x27;s how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.</span>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine
In the past this was easily available, with the most popular brand being Sudafed. My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself.
Pseudoephedrine is very effective. It is also used to synthesize the somewhat related illegal drug methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;). Historically, meth manufacturers would hire people to buy large amounts of pseudoephedrine pil…</span>

Yes, my glasses are taped because I&#x27;m still recovering from rhinoplasty and need to alleviate pressure off my nose.

For those who want to know:
20 sessions of laser + 4 sessions of electrolysis. Still slightly grey on upper and lower lip and continuing laser. I started Progesterone on month five instead of month six--and I shouldn&#x27;t have. I was simply hurting too much and trying to rush the process. Cyproterone as T-blocker and patches for Estrogen. I&#x27;m not giving the amounts here because that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important--it&#x27;s your blood level concentration for T and E that you should be looking at.
Thinking I would at least like to be one cup bigger in breast growth!
Everyone tells me to imagine where I&#x27;ll be in three years time and in all honesty, I don&#x27;t even know where I&#x27;ll be next year. I try not to think too far ahead now and just stay in the moment. :)
Ew-phoria moment: got checked out by a group of four men in a very uncomfortable way that made me run off. No thank you.
Weird moments: suddenly being asked out in the past two weeks and having crushes admitted to me by a few friends and I had to quickly and politely--but firmly--turn them down. Sorry, I&#x27;m very much taken.</span>

                              <span>I recently received an email from a reader of my blog asking about my process for building things.
I was wondering if you&#x27;d be willing to share your workflow for building products. At big companies, we&#x27;d usually do a lot of planning with diagrams, documentation, etc before building anything. I tend to get stuck in analysis paralysis when it comes to building a new products. Seeing how you&#x27;ve built some nice tools like Bear Blog, I wanted to hear from you personally.
I&#x27;ve built a lot of things over the past 10 years. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, with a few of them becoming actual products that fund the rest of my tinkering.
My approach to building products is more akin to a gardener than to a product developer. I play around with ideas, follow interesting threads, and see where the p…</span>

What the EU has done is far from perfect but it bans the worst practices. The Chinese can buy all of the information they want on Americans and Canadians from ad brokers, who will happily sell them everything they need to track individuals&#x27; locations.
Perhaps the way to get anti-regulation politicians on board with this is for someone to do what was done to Robert Bork and legally disclose lots of personal info on members of Congress/Parliament, obtained from data brokers and de-anonymized.</span>

Response: Actually, here is the correct definition of &quot;inflation.&quot; As you can see from the correct definition, inflation rates are now good! Hopefully this helps you understand why things will never get better.
What the average voter hears: I can&#x27;t afford groceries. Your solution to this problem is to reframe the current situation as &quot;good.&quot; I still can&#x27;t afford groceries.</span>

                              <span>I remember living in a different country as a child, hearing everyone talk about a faraway place called America.
Everyone wanted to go to America. The adults always spoke about the diversity of people there, the opportunities we could have, and the freedom we’d experience.
Even as a seven-year-old, I sensed the importance of this. Freedom mattered. At the time, we lived in a country where men and women had to walk on separate sides of the street. Women were required to cover themselves. Men and families had separate entrances and seating in restaurants. Women weren’t allowed to drive.
America was the place to be. We would get freedom there.
That was a long time ago.
Now, after living in America for over 26 years as an adult, I see less and less of what those adults once spoke about. It’s no longer the country people dream of coming to.
Today, we are a country that elects a convicted felon. A country where 71 million people chose to elect a fascist over a more than qualified woman. America is now a place where climate change, reproductive rights, and the rights of minorities are dismissed and disregarded—a country increasingly hostile toward those who are not just like them.
I am utterly and devastatingly heartbroken (and terrified).
I went to sleep knowing he would win, but I still held on to a sliver of hope. I woke up at 5 AM and saw Associated Press officially call his win.
A lot will change over these next 4 years.
Be kind to your loved ones today.
Many of us need it.
