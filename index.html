                              <span>I swear, MS kills all the useful features in Windows.
For comparison, configuring a network interface using Control Panel is simple, straight forward and allows me to change all the settings I want. Trying to do the same thing using the Settings app is complex, it hides pretty nuch all of the advanced settings that you want to see or change. And on top of that, it doesn’t even show you how long that interface has been connected to the network and how much data was transferred both ways: incredible debugging info lost.
Oh, and the fact that you can’t tick which updates you want and which you don’t…
I’m pretty sure others have other gripes with the “streamlined experience”.</span>

                              <span>I left my AirPods Pro at a school sports field an hour away, and I didn&#x27;t realize until the next morning after it been raining heavily. I gave them up for lost and needed headphones for work – so ordered some from Apple with same day delivery.
A week later, I got a Find My notification that they had been spotted – at the same sports field. I figured what the hell, put on a podcast and drove the hour to see if I could find them. Worst case scenario, a couple of hours of driving.
Using Find My and the directional feature points you in the right direction to within feet, I found them in the tall grass.
The case had been perfectly watertight, and they&#x27;d barely lost a percent of power in a week. Remarkable really all round.</span>

                              <span>I can imagine a series of events at MS like below (A pure imagination):
1. A new UX head is hired and looks for something that will make them look important.
2. Initiate a usability research across all the features in the Windows UI.
3. Make an internal announcement. &quot;Our research shows that many users are scared of changing settings in Control Panel. They are afraid of breaking the system by changing anything there. We will create a new UX for changing settings in a simple, intuitive, and innovative way.&quot;
4. They hire many UX researchers, visual designers, UI prototypers, and of course many middle managers.
5. A year later, another announcement. &quot;We now have a complete understanding of how we can create a simple, intuitive, and innovative user experience. Now our engineering team will implement this in upcoming years.&quot;
6. They hire many product managers, UI engineers, program managers, QA team, and of course many middle managers.
7. Two years later, another announcement. &quot;We are launching the new innovative UX that replaces Control Panel&quot;.
8. Get a lot of internal feedback. &quot;The new UI doesn&#x27;t let me change X or Y setting&quot;, &quot;The new UI is too slow&quot;, &quot;Too much whitespace in the new UI&quot;, etc. They are all ignored as &quot;working as intended&quot;. They say &quot;X and Y settings are used by very few users. Use the old UI for those settings.&quot;
9. Several years later, &quot;We don&#x27;t have enough engineering resources to maintain two different apps. Let&#x27;s kill Control Panel.&quot;</span>

                              <span>A counter point on premium VR headsets. They are teleportation devices.
I&#x27;ve used every popular VR device, but one Vision Pro experience stood out - &#x27;The Haleakala environment&#x27;[1]
It was literally like being transported there. I know because I had been in that exact spot a few years before. I have a rich visual memory which served as reference, and no exaggeration, it felt like was there. I was immediately in tears. It was profound.
The Vision pro&#x27;s lack of a killer app because development is unintuitive, userbase is small, the UX is alien and the hardware costs of constructing these experience is still rather high. Give it a few years. The hardware is already there. This isn&#x27;t a solution in search of a problem. This is PalmOS, a solution that is too early to the market.
I have family with disabilities. Being able to teleport my loved ones to places they could never go themselves is worth the $3000. If I could record my most profound memories with &#x27;VR recorder&#x27;, I would. My parent missed my graduation because of being continents away. You think they wouldn&#x27;t want to be teleported to it ? Wedding photographers cost $4000+, so we can relive those memories through shoddy snapshots. Why not be teleported back to the most beautiful day ?
Don&#x27;t knock it till you try it.

                              <span>Similar experience: Citibank Retirement.
I had about $80,000 in IRA/CD&#x27;s. I&#x27;d created &amp; contributed to them over a period of 35 years.
Last year, it&#x27;s time to retire, and Citibank won&#x27;t give me half the money.  It seems that some CD&#x27;s are for &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; and some for &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Citibank Retirement demanded a &quot;Marriage Certificate, Divorce Decree, or Court Order&quot; to demonstrate that &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; is the same person as &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Took more than 8 months, dozens of emails, five visits to Citibank offices, and a letter to the Citibank president, to shake loose money that I&#x27;d deposited across three decades.</span>

                              <span>A friend found some AirPods on the ground and tapped them to his phone, revealing only the serial number and the last four digits of the owner&#x27;s number. He turned to me for help.
All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let&#x27;s give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn&#x27;t much to a determined spammer, but I didn&#x27;t want to be that noisy or piss off Twilio.
Possible matches: 999
Prefixes
Next, I narrowed it down by central office code (commonly called prefix) (those three digits after the area code). Most of Portland’s are assigned, but only 26% to wireless carriers. Also, 000-199 are reserved codes that aren&#x27;t available for telcos. I lied earlier, sorry.
Possible matches: 232
iMessage Lookup API

Next, I had to assume the owner had iMessage enabled, which seemed like a safe bet. I ran an iMessage check using an API. (The API is probably used for shady stuff, but my intentions were pure.)
Total matches: 84
Did you lose your AirPods?
With the list whittled down, I avoided Twilio entirely by using a script on my MacBook to send iMessages in bulk. Now we wait.
1 Match
Bingo! I found the owner, relayed the contact info to my friend, and the AirPods were returned to the right ears.
Notes
Yes, Find My exists, but they had no idea how to use it. Plus, where&#x27;s the fun in that?
I did have to field a few messages from confused people, but I got really lucky and hit in less than 10 messages. We confirmed that the AirPods paired, which wouldn&#x27;t be possible if they didn&#x27;t belong to them.
*Portland has two area codes, but I only had to try one. Luck, right?</span>

                              <span>There are random days when I look at my blog and am tempted to scrap it all. It’s not because I hate it, or am unhappy with it, but mostly because I have this need and want to start all over again; a new slate if you will.
I start thinking: does this tiny corner of the internet I’ve created reflect who I am? Sometimes I’m OK with my answer, and then there are days when I’m not.
I’m not super happy with my dark mode color palette. I want to make changes to it but I don’t have a clue on what I want yet. I wish I can keep my theme on light mode, but I also don’t want to burn peoples retinas. The dark mode stays. Pending updates later.
Robert recently created a Bear theme, Bearming. This inspired me to make tiny changes to my page until I can figure out what I want.

 “Anarchism is still the most beautiful ideal, and I think someday it will come,” wrote Lau Chung-Si (Ray Jones) from a small apartment in San Francisco. At the time he put these words to paper in 1974, he was a relic of another time. Jones was a Chinese man who, in 1909, immigrated to the United States and quickly became enamoured with the ideas of anarchism. He was involved in a collective of Chinese American anarchists in San Francisco named Pingsheh (Equality Society). He also attended meetings held by ot…</span>

According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, the scale of destruction imposed on Gaza is not only devastating but ethically unimaginable.

That amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion. Not to be outdone in the stupidity sweepstakes, Joe “Copycat” Biden added his tariffs. They affected batteries, steel, aluminum, semiconductors, solar cells, electric vehicles, critical minerals and more. More

adopting a new (v1beta4) version of
its configuration file format. Configuration in the previous v1beta3 format is now formally
deprecated, which means it&#x27;s supported but you should migrate to v1beta4 and stop using
the deprecated format.
Support for v1beta3 configuration will be removed after a minimum of 3 Kubernetes minor releases.
In this article, I&#x27;ll walk you through key changes;
I&#x27;ll explain about the kubeadm v1beta4 configuration format,
and how to migrate from v1beta3 to v1beta4.
You can read the reference for the v1beta4 configuration format:

This version improves on the v1beta3
format by fixing some minor issues and adding a few new fields.

                              <span>&gt; Only a very few people possess the level of discernment needed to know how bad your local concert hall&#x27;s piano is, and precisely how it is bad. If their art dies out, maybe nobody will know how bad all the pianos are. And then we&#x27;ll all have slightly worse pianos than we would otherwise have. And I mean if that&#x27;s the way things are going to go, then let&#x27;s just steer the Earth into the Sun, because what&#x27;s the point of any of this.
The problem with this line of thinking -- &quot;If X happens then we&#x27;ll all be cooked!&quot; -- is that it ignores the fact that X already has been happening and yet life is just fine.
There&#x27;s an infinite number of pursuits in which expert practitioners could theoretically possess a level of discernment so sublime that nobody else can understand it, let alone appreciate it.
A huge number of these arts will either never be practiced, or were practiced in the past but have already decline. And yet there&#x27;s no mass ennui or clamoring to steer the Earth into the sun.
The pinnacle of human attention cannot be directed at everything, everywhere, all at once. We have to focus our attention on a limited subset of arts and pursuits, where discernment will always be high, and settle everywhere else.</span>

                              <span>We cannot forget that we also loose something with working remotely (say more than 75% of the time) and that is the occasional bumping into each other at the water cooler or in the morning when coming in. These are situations you can artificially create by scheduling calls to socialize etc, but that is still not comparable with being in an actual office.
By categorically saying no to quick calls, you&#x27;re isolating yourself even more. While it can be distracting to jump on a call while you actually meant to focus on some coding, it can also be great to have a quick chat and brainstorm about an idea rather than let the other person work out the solution in isolation only for me to then suggest a totally different approach in the PR review (yay! asynchronous!).</span>

                              <span>&gt; Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves.
One thing I loved about doing technical enterprise sales is that I’d meet people doing something I knew little or nothing about and who didn’t really understand what we offered but had a problem they could explain and our offering could help with.
They’d have deep technical knowledge of their domain and we had the same in ours, and there was just enough shared knowledge at the interface between the two that we could have fun and useful discussions. Lots of mutual respect.  I’ve always enjoyed working with smart people even when I don’t really understand what they do.
Of course there were also idiots, but generally they weren’t interested in paying what we charged, so that was OK.
&gt; Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves.
So I feel a lot of sympathy for the author — that would be terribly soul sucking.
I guess generative grammars have increased the number of “I have a great idea for a technical business, I just need a technical co founder” who think that an idea is 90% of it and have no idea what technical work actually is.</span>

                              <span>I just read through the latest entries in my guestbook. So many wonderful messages! I&#x27;m both happy and touched. Thank you all!
At the same time, I find it a bit difficult to truly embrace it. I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything particularly valuable to contribute, and I think I&#x27;m a mediocre writer.
I believe many people can relate to this. That&#x27;s just how it is with that inner critic, it&#x27;s never satisfied. There&#x27;s always something that isn&#x27;t good enough.
If we treated other people the way we treat ourselves, we wouldn&#x27;t have any friends left. And we&#x27;d probably get slapped around now and then for our terrible behavior.
If we list our favorites when it comes to books, movies, music, etc., then surely many of the creators would absolutely disagree. The creator and the created are too closely intertwined. There is no space for a fair judgement.
Perhaps this is precisely what we need to remind ourselves of when self-doubt is knocking at the door, and self-criticism is wagging its finger. Regardless of what we ourselves think of what we create, we can be sure of one thing:
There&#x27;s always someone who appreciates it.
It&#x27;s that person we do it for.</span>

They say that home is where the heart is, and I wholeheartedly agree. A home doesn’t have to be a place, but if you had to put a place to it, where would you consider home to be?
My cousins, back in my birth country, will ask: “When are you coming home?” It always stops me in my tracks. I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time. Although I try to hold on to my culture, my identity closely tied to it, the country itself is more of a distant past than a present reality. And yet, to them, it is still my home.

That&#x27;s a bold statement and I don&#x27;t mean for it to be. I definitely care about how people treat me and that&#x27;s often tied into their opinion so I&#x27;m not being an absolutist. Some things that a lot of people find important are of little interest to me, cars for example. I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry with 230K miles on it that is a hand me down from my mother. I&#x27;m almost 60. I also don&#x27;t try to appear neutral on controversial topics. My wife has to shush me around Republicans because I have a tendency to tell her the latest asshole thing they&#x27;ve done at a volume level loud enough to be heard by people who may disagree with me.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been mulling over the concept of free-flowing, stream-of-consciousness writing for a while now. I used to use an app in Fedora approximately 2 years back, which had a &quot;Hemingway&quot; mode that let me write but not redact anything. This is exactly like in real life. We say things but can never retrace what we&#x27;ve said. This is true entropy in expression, and I think it&#x27;s profound.
I don&#x27;t want to dwell on consciousness and what it all means, since this isn&#x27;t the focus of this blog. Rather, I want to understand how entropy rules over the spoken word and how we&#x27;ve cheated our way around with writing. Consider this blog right now. As I&#x27;m writing it, I&#x27;m trying my best to write every word exactly and not delete anything, but in this sentence alone I&#x27;ve had to do that more than 15 times now. And…</span>

                              <span>As I improve my programming skills and explore new tech, I keep getting overwhelmed by all the information. Maybe I’m just impatient, but it’s incredibly frustrating to spend time messing around with code and end up with nothing to show for it. I mentioned this in another blog, but I still don’t know how to feel about it. Is it me? Is it just the nature of programming?
I’ve been coding as a hobbyist for a while, but this year I decided to take it more seriously and learn better practices. I wanted to make coding a daily habit. However, as I dive into more complex repositories, I often find myself going down a rabbit hole of reading docs, code, and comments, trying to figure out what I need to produce the results I want. I end up coding all day, only to see a few lines of code actually make it into the final product.
It’s definitely a lack of domain knowledge in the libraries I’m using, but is there no faster way to learn them?
Now that I think about it, I’ve been exploring a lot of new repos lately—botting, Roblox scripting, Textual, and Hugo. Maybe it’s just an odd situation where I feel like I’m drowning in technology.
Do you feel the same way? If you’re more experienced, does this feeling go away as you get better? I doubt it. Love to hear back from someone.
P.S. I think I just need to keep at it.

                              <span>After applying to 200+ positions over the past four months (and getting interviewed for just two of them - it&#x27;s rough out there!), I&#x27;m super excited to have accepted an offer for a position that&#x27;s basically tailor-made for my skills and aspirations. I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to focus on the sort of platform-y work that I want to do. It&#x27;s going to be so much fun!
Of course, before I can get to the new gig I&#x27;ll spend the next three weeks wrapping up and/or handing off everything that I&#x27;d been working on for my current employer. It&#x27;s a good thing that past-John typically did a good job of documenting things as he went. Still, it&#x27;s going to be a busy few weeks!
Oh, and that other position that I interviewed for? I got rejected, and the company went on to break the entire world the following week. So I guess that one actually worked out pretty well for me, too.</span>

&quot;I don&#x27;t want to work in IT anymore.&quot;
I saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.
I had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!
But over time, something started to feel off. I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.
Then one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.
– Yes, I can&#x27;t imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.
In that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!
When I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.
Fast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.
And when it comes to IT, I&#x27;m more passionate about it now that it&#x27;s a hobby instead of a career. It&#x27;s fun again!
Are you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.
Chok Dee, as they say in Thailand.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes I get tired of formulating words to help things make sense. At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.
I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

&quot;I know you might be worried about regrets later, but sometimes it&#x27;s okay to break the ritual, to interrupt the flow, to just pause and breathe it all in. No achievement is going to light up above your head when you write all the words, read all the books, collect all the things. Not one that&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run anyway. Be joyful when you can, be reflective when you need to be, but most of all, focus on being. If that means writing, great. If that means quiet, that&#x27;s great too.&quot; by Netigen

No, the internet being free and open is what allows advertisers to exploit us. They can find other business models other than advertisement. It&#x27;s not our problem. They need to stop making it our problem.

                              <span>When I was a teenageer a school counselor incorrectly perceived me to be in a crisis and had me sent to 72 hour hold (which stays on certain records for quite a while and can be incredibly disruptive, but that&#x27;s besides the point) - for some reason I was sent almost 40 miles away in another county in a city I&#x27;d never been. The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn&#x27;t belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn&#x27;t enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn&#x27;t have my glasses, phone, or wallet.
I really don&#x27;t know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car. I had to beg for money and walk the last several miles once I recognized finally where I was. It really sucked, and ever since then I&#x27;ve had a great deal of sympathy for people that are churned through this terrible system and spit right back out with no dignity whatsoever, let alone empathy. This incident disrupted my life irreversibly (ended up missing tests and having to do a medical withdrawal from school, lost scholarships, etc) and derailed a lot of things I had wanted to do for many, many years. The hospital/medical care industrial complex doesn&#x27;t optimize for empathy. They&#x27;re just trying to get the bodies through as quickly as possible.</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;d be amazed how bad hospitals can be at keeping track of fairly critical things.
I had a cousin who voluntarily checked himself into the hospital related to severe withdrawal symptoms (and had bouts of psychosis related to said with withdrawal - meth addictions are nasty).  His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.
Late that night, he was discharged. Not even &quot;he checked himself out&quot;. The hospital discharged him (and that&#x27;s over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).
He had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn&#x27;t remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn&#x27;t get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.
The hospital had his mother&#x27;s contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.
We still don&#x27;t know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.
Forcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I&#x27;m furious about it.  Apparently it&#x27;s common and not even something there&#x27;s any recourse for.</span>

                              <span>One suggestion is simply increase the price.  Price is strongly correlated with quality of customer.   Price also acts as signaling that this is a tool for professionals who make actual money and so shouldn&#x27;t be bothered coughing up something trivial like $100 for a subscription.  You end up making more with far less customer support.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Forgings have the added advantage of variable grain direction which generally can be tailored to the stress patterns of a specific design.
This is a super underappreciated fact!  It&#x27;s often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.
Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it 2-4x stronger in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.
Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.
Think of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.
For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.  Blacksmiths had a legitimately intellectual job back in the day!</span>

                              <span>Can relate, I&#x27;ve been in a similar boat running a small B2B Saas over the last 2 years. It does get easier over time.
I&#x27;ve learnt a few tricks for managing early stage pain points.
- You need to develop a polite but curt tone of voice for customer support.
- Once your core product is built, its worthwhile spending some time automating the heck out of everything. This will save a TON of time in the near future.
- Invest in good docs, even if you&#x27;re not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.
I think a lot of literature around running a online biz has been boiled down to rather basic advice and its hard to find anything solid in this area. I&#x27;ve been running a small blog where I document these issues(operational.co) if anyone wants to check it out.</span>

                              <span>There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, kubectl debug is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It
provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&#x27;s point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image&#x3D;busybox --profile&#x3D;netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific
necessities, and unfortunately, some can&#x27;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.

                              <span>This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.31 to improve the handling of supplementary groups in containers within Pods.
Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image
Although this behavior may not be popular with many Kubernetes cluster users/admins, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image.
Let&#x27;s see an example, below Pod specifies runAsUser&#x3D;1000, runAsGroup&#x3D;3000 and supplementalGroups&#x3D;4000 in the Pod&#x27;s security context.

                              <span>In Kubernetes v1.31, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to CPU management capabilities: the distribute-cpus-across-cores option for the CPUManager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.
Understanding the feature
Traditionally, Kubernetes&#x27; CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…</span>

Title: Thoughts During Imprisonment
Date: Oct 26, 1909
Source: Nihon Rekishi Issue 131 (1951)

 It is government suppression. It is tyranny. 
 Even until now, I am unable to give a viewpoint on whether the ending of a human life is a good or bad thing, regardless of someone giving me a good or bad name for it. Daring to be brief about whether or not to end a human life, I am neither for nor against either choice, because I am for the sake of everybody’s happiness, with an unshakeable faith to stand on the impossible conviction of working for the freedom of any or even all people. 
 I wish that I will behave in accordance with the demands of reason and not based on the demands of immediate emotions or instincts based on material desire. If this course of action is in a…</span>

                              <span>I feel like I&#x27;m living in a different universe sometimes. The consensus on HN seems to be that you can be pretty productive with LLMs as coding assistants, but every time I try I find it borderline impossible to get functional code even for pretty straightforward prompts.
I decided to fire up GPT-4o again today to see if maybe things have gotten better over the past few months.
I asked GPT to write code to render a triangle using Vulkan (a 3D graphics API). There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4&#x27;s training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it&#x27;s not a simple case of copy/paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)
Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:
GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer. So that&#x27;s a guaranteed memory access violation right off the bat.</span>

                              <span>I literally got a pointless noncompete removed from a contract just because of the FTC announcement.
The proposed noncompete had a 10-year lockup for a freelance contract…obviously nonsense. But it was so helpful to say “these aren’t sticking around so let’s just cut it out.”
These changes make a big difference in encouraging entrepreneurs and helping our economy, as well as just reducing stress for a lot of people.</span>

This conflict goes back a long time. In the early 1990&#x27;s, with online journals just getting started, MIT was able to insist on principles like &quot;anyone physically in the library has full access, even if they are not otherwise affiliated with MIT&quot;. A couple of years later, power shifted, and Elsevier could &quot;our terms, take it or leave it&quot;. Then three decades, a human generation, of Elsevier rent-seeking, and so many people working towards Open Access, unbundling, google scholar, arXiv, sci-hub, and so on. Societal change can be so very slow, nonmonotonic, and profoundly discouraging. And yet here we are, making progress.
For anyone unfamiliar with &quot;author [...] required to relinquish copyright [...] generous reuse rights&quot;, journals would require authors to completely sign over copyright, so authors&#x27; subsequent other-than-fair-use usage of fragments would be a copyright violation. Rarely enforced, but legally you&#x27;d have to obtain permission. While some institutions sign contracts easily, and struggle with the fallout later, MIT legal culture has been pain-up-front careful with contracts. Which is sometimes painful. But IIRC, we&#x27;re today using X Windows instead of CMU&#x27;s Andrew, because MIT could say &quot;sure!&quot; while CMU was &quot;sure, err,... we&#x27;ll get back to you... some mess to clean up first&quot;.</span>

                              <span>The key thing to understand here is the exfiltration vector.
Slack can render Markdown links, where the URL is hidden behind the text of that link.
In this case the attacker tricks Slack AI into showing a user a link that says something like &quot;click here to reauthenticate&quot; - the URL attached to that link goes to the attacker&#x27;s server, with a query string that includes private information that was visible to Slack AI as part of the context it has access to.
If the user falls for the trick and clicks the link, the data will be exfiltrated to the attacker&#x27;s server logs.
Here&#x27;s my attempt at explaining this attack: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/20/data-exfiltration-from...</span>

                              <span>Working as a SRE for a year in a large global company broke me out of this &quot;panic&quot; mode described in this post. To a business, every problem seems like a world-ending event. It&#x27;s very easy to give in to panic in those situations. However, in reality, it&#x27;s rarely that bad, and even if it is, you&#x27;ll probably survive without harm. The key in these situations, and what I try to do (totally relate to breaking out in a sweat, that still happens to me, just happened yesterday) is to take 5-10 minutes before doing any action to try to fix it and sketch it out, think about it as clearly as you can. Fear interferes with your ability to reason rationally. Mashing buttons in a panic can make your problems spiral even worse (seen that happen). Disrupting that fear circuit any way you can is important. Splashing my face and hands with extremely cold water is my trick.
Then after you go through a few of these, you&#x27;ll realize it really isn&#x27;t too bad and you&#x27;ve dealt with bad situations before and you&#x27;ll gain the confidence to know you can deal with it, even when there&#x27;s no one you can reach out to for help.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m not convinced. Most of the argument seems to be that redundant UX is bad UX:
&gt; But by archiving the email, the email disappears from the list, which already implies the action was successful.
&gt; In this example, the button already includes a confirmation so the toast is entirely unnecessary.
I vehemently disagree with the idea that just because you&#x27;re already communicating something one way it&#x27;s bad UX to include another way of communicating the same thing at the same time. Redundancy in communication is a feature, not a bug, and it&#x27;s present in all human languages. It ensures that even in less than ideal conditions the message still gets through.
In the case of toasts, having a single, standardized way of communicating the status of all actions (and if possible providing the undo) allows a user to quickly pick up on the pattern. Extra indicators closer to the action can be valuable too, but it&#x27;s when they&#x27;re paired with the toast that their meaning becomes entirely clear.  To remove the toast in favor of a bunch of specific indicators is to force your user to learn several different ways of saying &quot;it&#x27;s done now&quot; entirely from context (many of which will be small and subtle as in the examples given). This might work fine for you and me but isn&#x27;t great for, say, the elderly or the vision impaired or children.
Unless they&#x27;re actually getting in the way, toasts aren&#x27;t bad UX, they&#x27;re redundant UX, and a UX designer shouldn&#x27;t be striving to optimize away redundancy.</span>

                              <span>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet&#x27;s cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn&#x27;t new
enough to have support for this feature.</span>

                              <span>The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

                              <span>Today I realised this would be my 96th post here, on my Bear blog. And that&#x27;s just from somewhere from the first week of April. I&#x27;m nearing that magic 100 posts. Though, of course, as is typical, I only started the 100DaysToOffload challenge half way through and am only on post 48 of the challenge itself. But hey, that&#x27;s okay.
I know I can be a prolific writer and love to talk about everything and anything. You can thank my family and a lack of TV in our house till much later than everyone else on the planet, for that. I can thank my parents for an inquisitive nature, an appetite for reading anything with print on it, and a love of science and nature, and the physical world around us. Funny how growing up without smart devices, TV, and only access to museums and libraries shaped who I am.

                              <span>&quot;What&#x27;s the secret?&quot;
I asked this question to one of my clients today. He was 85 years old, looked 60, and was as fit and agile as a 50-year-old.
He replied: &quot;There&#x27;s no secret. I enjoy walking. That’s all.&quot;
No secrets. No tricks. Completely natural.
But that&#x27;s often how it is, isn’t it; we think there&#x27;s a code to crack, a secret recipe to follow to achieve success. When in reality, the answer lies in the most natural thing in the world.
If we want to increase our chances of being in good shape, then we need to make sure we move around a bit. If we want to become a better writer, then we need to make sure we write a lot.
There&#x27;s no secret.</span>

                              <span>I’m currently outside, having a smoking break.
I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

Around 2AM this morning I had a realization that this was the most stressed I have ever been. On verge of a complete breakdown.
Why? Because I noticed around 10PM that jumpcomedy.com was entirely broken with all HTTP POST calls made by RTK Query failing. Nothing worked and though I had deployed recent changes, none of them would cause this. I was at a complete loss as to where to look, especially as this is working locally. Posting on the usual Discords (NextJS, Vercel) is leading to dead silence. I&#x27;m alone and have to fix this issue which I didn&#x27;t cause.
This isn&#x27;t the first production defect I&#x27;ve introduced in my 25 years of working, but this is the first one where I had absolutely nobody to turn to in a time of crisis while customer complaints are pilin…</span>

                              <span>I no longer want to simply be a developer, an artist, or a sporty person. I’ve changed my mindset:
from &quot;I want to be a developer&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who enjoys tinkering with coding and tech every day,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be an artist&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who appreciates and creates art,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be a runner&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who loves running and taking walks.&quot;
This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.
I remind myself that becoming is a lifelong journey that never truly ends. We never completely become anything; we are always in the process of becoming. So, there’s no point in fixating on final results.
Just enjoy the path, stay on the path, and keep becoming.</span>

                              <span>Long-run trends in increased access to credit are thought to improve real activity. However, “rapid” credit expansions do not always end well and have been shown in the academic literature to predict adverse real outcomes such as lower GDP growth and an increased likelihood of crises. Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.</span>

                              <span>&gt; In the Netherlands alone, these solar panels generate a power output equivalent to at least 25 medium sized nuclear power plants.
Since this didn&#x27;t pass the smell test: the author is looking at nameplate capacity, which is a completely useless metric for variable electricity production sources (a solar panel in my sunless basement has the same nameplate capacity as the same panel installed in the Sahara desert).
Looking at actual yearly energy generation data, this is more like 1.5 times the generation of an average nuclear power plant (NL solar production in 2023: 21TWh, US nuclear production in 2021: 778TWh by 54 plants).
Which maybe puts more into perspective the actual risks involved here. I&#x27;m not saying there shouldn&#x27;t be more regulations and significantly better security practices, but otoh you could likely drive a big truck into the right power poles and cause a similar sized outage.</span>

                              <span>In Kubernetes 1.31, by default kubectl now uses the WebSocket protocol
instead of SPDY for streaming.
This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs
matter.
Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that&#x27;s bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create
a shell in a running container from your local…</span>

                              <span>You might answer that you haven&#x27;t yet (but wish you had). However, if you&#x27;re in your 30s, have a well-established job, and a busy life (away from academia), you might respond, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, since college maybe?&quot;
Sure, you&#x27;ve learned. You might have explored a topic you&#x27;re curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: &quot;all the time!&quot;
Please, re-read the question.
I didn&#x27;t ask when was the last time you learned something new. I&#x27;m talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.
Maybe I&#x27;m alone in this feeling, but it&#x27;s been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.
That&#x27;s why, from now on, I&#x27;m going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.
I&#x27;m currently working on my syllabus, which I&#x27;ll gladly share with you once I&#x27;ve finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other&#x27;s schedules).
Take a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.
I can&#x27;t wait to learn with you all.</span>

1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.
About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&#x27;re willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
