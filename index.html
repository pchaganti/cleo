                              <span>Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.</span>

                              <span>It should come as no surprise to those of us with even a cursory understanding of the history of U.S. imperialism that the once sovereign Kingdom of Hawai’i became the very first state in the nation to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Hawai’i is an occupied nation, and has been since 1893 when the U.S. launched a coup to overthrow the sovereign rule of Queen Liliʻuokalani. We don’t need to dive that far back into historical memory to discover that even this imperialist overthrow was acknowledged by none other than then president Bill Clinton, who, in 1993 (on the centennial of the coup) issued an official apology to the Hawaiian Kingdom—an apology that notably did not include a return of the land to the people of this occupied island nation.

I started writing about Going Infinite about the highly autistic Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, FTX and its downfall. However, I couldn&#x27;t do it justice. I recommend picking up the book and reading it for yourself. FWIW, after reading it, your pov should remain the same of &quot;crypto is highly retarded&quot;.
Instead of going down that rabbit hole, I decided to go for a feel-good post with a little update since deciding to step away from my former profession...
Okay, so I left on April 3rd, 2024 so it&#x27;s been a total of 97 days and during that time I have:
Severely reduced the stress and anxiety I was dealing with day to day by no longer making my life revolve solely around work.

One image. The early editions of CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were all text-based, as were local BBSs. When the real Internet, the kind you access through a browser, or rather through Netscape 1.0, became available, for me in 1996, most of us had 14.4 modems; we quickly upgraded to 28.8 and then 56.6 bps. When things were still super slow, I remember downloading Netscape 2.0 like it was the birth of another child. It was about 6 MB in size, and it took 45 minutes of &quot;NOBODY CAN USE THE PHONE.&quot; I paced back and forth outside on my lawn, smoking cigarettes and trying to imagine what the new web would look…</span>

i am absolutely exploding inside with this news, but i have no way to scream it, so this will have to do.
we&#x27;ve put an offer in on a house on sunday, and they accepted it today! i cannot believe it! i cried all the two hours it took for us to get home; partially because this is a dream that i have worked so hard for and never thought i&#x27;d actually get.
the house is deeply within our budget, thank goodness; but it&#x27;s pushing the limits of commute for my boyfriend, which is unfortunate. i wish it was still affordable to live within reasonable commuting distance of a major city like seattle, but i&#x27;m just so thankful that we&#x27;re staying in the pacific northwest. i&#x27;m really loving every second of being here, and it feels as though i was always meant to be here in this moment—i…</span>

                              <span>I’d argue that a factor in CUDA’s success is their army of in-house researchers which use CUDA to do novel things. Sometimes those things get turned into products (OptiX) other times they are essentially DevRel to show off what the hardware can do and documentation for how to do it. Additionally I’m sure they use pre-release hardware and software and give feedback about how to improve it.
I don’t know what AMD has in mind for this acquisition but I could see there being a lot of value having an in house LLM team to create models for customers to build on, run in benchmarks, and improve their products.</span>

                              <span>All: if you&#x27;re going to post on a topic like this please make sure you&#x27;re not just commenting out of reflexive activation. That&#x27;s not what HN is for, as the site guidelines try to make clear: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.
On HN, we want comments that are thoughtful—i.e. that come from reflection, not reflex [1]; and specific—i.e. that have to do with what&#x27;s different about a story, not what&#x27;s generic. This is not particular to any topic; it&#x27;s an optimization problem: we&#x27;re trying to optimize the site for intellectual curiosity [2].
The trouble with reflexive comments is that they repeat responses that have already happened many times—rather as if they&#x27;re being served from cache [3]. The trouble with generic comments is that the generic level is too abstract to say anything new or interesting. Put those together and you get repetition, the arch-enemy of curiosity [4].

[3] This, btw, is why such comments always show up quickly: cached responses are the fastest to arise. The kind of thoughtful comments we&#x27;re looking for take longer to &quot;compute&quot;.

 A couple weeks ago, I was talking to my friends who run the podcast It Could Happen Here. “Summer is coming, and an awful lot of people are newly radicalized. You all should put out an episode about what the next steps are,” I told them. 
 “Perfect,” someone replied. “Write it and record it by May 20th.” 
 So I wrote a short and incomplete guide for new activists. You can hear me present it in audio format if you’d like. 
 I’m coming with my own biases which I want to get out right up front: I’m an anarchist, and it’s also been decades since I broke into the movement, beca…</span>

 A short poem “Adoring Naivety” by a Christian poet Jukichi Yagi (1827–1927) runs as follows: 
 Rice bread, 
 Whole-rice bread, 
 Fresh and steaming! 
 Whole-rice bread! 
 A bread seller goes about a “Non-acting” (Mu-i 無 爲 akarma) path singing cries of wares, as if in ecstacy over his singing.[1]
 This verse seems to suggest the aesthetic character of the Japanese folks. In the early days, Japanese peddlers, such as gold-fish vendors, beancurd dealers and seedling-peddlers used to peddle by crying in rythmical voices. Mood, relish, flavour and atmosphere carry great weight in a Japanese life. “Japanese ph…</span>

Instead of a Prologue
 About the subject of “Individuality and the anarchist group”, one could say that it’s a timeless issue within the anarchist milieu… Is an anarchist individuality subjugated or liberated within a group? How does the individual encounter the collective? Can disagreements between comrades of the same collective be creative or do they inevitably lead to disputes, rivalries, intrigues, competitions and end up in rupture? 
 How are friendships and cliques able to bring about a cancellation of an anarchist group? 
 What is the relationship of an anarchist organization to the expulsions…</span>

Title: What Is Mutualism?
Date: 1927
Notes: This is a very interesting and valuable text on Mutualism. It is slightly dated in some points and a bit off the target when dealing with monetary matters. Nevertheless it remains a powerful exposition of the main tenets of Mutualism and a sincere plea in favour of the freedom and autonomy of the individual.

                              <span>&gt; Indeed, last year GitHub was said to have tuned its programming assistant to generate slight variations of ingested training code to prevent its output from being accused of being an exact copy of licensed software.
If I, a human, were to:
1. Carefully read and memorize some copyrighted code.
2. Produce new code that is textually identical to that. But in the process of typing it up, I randomly mechanically tweak a few identifiers or something to produce code that has the exact same semantics but isn&#x27;t character-wise identical.
3. Claim that as new original code without the original copyright.
I assume that I would get my ass kicked legally speaking. That reads to me exactly like deliberate copyright infringement with willful obfuscation of my infringement.
How is it any different when a machine does the same thing?</span>

&gt; There’ll be plots of various stats, including CPU utilization. I think meet will also helpfully suggest closing tabs if your machine is overloaded
This is not mundane at all, it&#x27;s a perfect example of giving your product an unfair competitive advantage.
If Meet users are told why their meeting isn&#x27;t working correctly but Zoom, Teams and Slack, Meet users are going to have a better experience that Zoom, Teams or Slack has no way of replicating.
No wonder every other meeting provider pushes you aggressively into using their desktop app, Google Meet&#x27;s desktop app is just Chrome!</span>

                              <span>The way this works (and I&#x27;m obviously taking a high level view here) is by comparing what is being played to what is being captured. There is an inherent latency in between what is called the capture stream (the mic) and the reverse stream (what is being output to the speakers, be it people taking or music or whatever), and by finding this latency and comparing, one can cancel the music from the speech captured.
Within a single process, or tree of processes that can cooperate, this is straightforward (modulo the actual audio signal processing which isn&#x27;t) to do: keep what you&#x27;re playing for a few hundreds milliseconds around, compare to what you&#x27;re getting in the microphone, find correlations, cancel.
If the process aren&#x27;t related there are multiple ways to do this. Either the OS provides a capture API that does the cancellation, this is what happens e.g. on macOS for Firefox and Safari, you can use this. The OS knows what is being output. This is often available on mobile as well.
Sometimes (Linux desktop, Windows) the OS provides a loopback stream: a way to capture the audio that is being played back, and that can similarly be used for cancellation.
If none of this is available, you mix the audio output and perform cancellation yourself, and the behaviour your observe happens.
Source: I do that, but at Mozilla and we unsurprisingly have the same problems and solutions.</span>

                              <span>I presume the only people you&#x27;re hurting by downloading gigabytes of docs are the people on the plain that paid for the service. Maybe the company providing the service because those people experiencing the slow connection might never buy again. You&#x27;re probably a also costing stripe for their upload bandwidth.
And here I am, avoiding downloading things on cell service because it might negatively impact other people around me.</span>

                              <span>Decades ago, my partner used Google Voice for texting -- really handy, texts just showed up in the gmail inbox, and could be replied to from there. She didn&#x27;t like cellphones, but usually carried one of the old &quot;Kindle Keyboard&quot; models with unlimited 3G data. The Kindle had simple web browser that could load the low-spec gmail interface, so in essence she had a fully functional SMS device, with no monthly charges.
Notification of incoming texts was the only problem. I jailbroke the thing and started trying to schedule network requests, thinking I&#x27;d add some kind of new message counter on the home screen. This proved hard. But it occurred to me that the best place for the counter would be right next to the Kindle&#x27;s device name, at the top of the screen. And the device name could be updated from her Amazon account.
So I automated a web browser on the home server to log into Amazon and update the device name to &quot;My Kindle (x)&quot; where x was the number of unread Google Voice texts. The Kindle would update the name on the home screen in less than a minute. This worked for years!
(Eventually that Kindle was stolen. I wanted to update its name to something foul but the device disappeared from her account too quickly.)</span>

                              <span>A non-stressful day at work is hard to come by. I am constantly straddling the fine line between being burnt out, and just flipping a table and walking away. At the end of the day, those two feelings are basically the same side of a coin.
I work remotely full-time, for the most part. Sometimes I travel for workshops, but that’s mostly just at the beginning of kicking off a new product that I’ve been asked to build. Any other time, I’m mostly working in my home office, which has become my favorite place in the house, yet the place where I stress out the most.
I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I’m in meetings probably 5-6 hours a day. With a majority of my current team in Central and Eastern time zones (2-3 hours ahead of me), sometimes I also forget to take a break and eat. It’s easy to lose track of time when I’m focused on solving this problem or that.
I also forget to breathe.
The weather finally cooled down yesterday, and a little bit today before we hit another heat wave. LSC constantly encourages me, and at times pushes me to go for a walk. Take a walk around the block, and just breathe. We practice breathing together, inhaling and exhaling. Inhale the fresh air slowly, keep it in for a few seconds, exhale slowly. Then we go back in the house, and I feel a tiny bit better.
Sometimes we get into what we’re doing so deeply that we forget the essentials. We forget to breathe. We don’t notice it until we’re drowning, and it’s even harder to get back to the surface. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder to stop what you’re doing, take a walk if you can, and breathe.
So hey, let this be a reminder.
Go for a walk. Inhale that fresh air. Hold it in. Exhale.

i’ve finally started a new job after my month-long vacation in europe. i’m still working in design, which is still not really my ideal (even if my high-school self was convinced it was)1. either way, it’s fun and i like it better than my previous one.
my last job was 100% remote. (they were changing this policy just as i was leaving though). i enjoyed having so much free time, of course. the commute in the philippines eats away up to 4 hours of your day, if you’re lucky. that’s not including time you spend getting ready, or time spent s…</span>

This tendency to ignore the world should be more troubling to American voters than even Biden’s refusal to leave the presidential stage in light of his thinly deniable disabilities of age and mental health that have put his 2024 candidacy in peril.

Farage’s germinal racism was public even at this early age, and in 1981, his fascist mannerisms were played down as ordinary “naughtiness” by his college’s “Master” when he chose to make him a prefect More

                              <span>I&#x27;d also like to highlight another bad practice by Ticketmaster.
When you purchase a ticket from them and resell it on their marketplace, once someone purchases it, they(Ticketmaster) hold your funds and only give you the money ~7-14 business days after the event is over. They say this is to verify the validity of the ticket.
On the buyer side, you purchase the ticket from the marketplace and it gets added to your account immediately. (I think) You get the barcode some time ~1 week before the actual event begins.
The confusion for me? Ticketmaster owned the ticket and all logic relating to the validity of it. The logic to validate this shouldn&#x27;t be complex at all. They OWN the ticket. They KNOW it&#x27;s legitimate because it never left their database. Yet they double dip and hold both buyer and seller funds. Events can be close to a year in the future but the seller won&#x27;t see that until after that event ends.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s something you can do since a lot of years. I used to do so 10 years ago, when I&#x27;ve got the first motherboard with UEFI. But is it useful? It saves a minimal time in the boot sequence, but at what cost?
The bootloader (being it grub, or something more simple as systemd-boot) is useful to me for a couple of reasons:
- it allows to dual-boot with Windows easily: motherboard boot menu is often not easy to access, you need to perform some key combination in a short window, also modern bootloader save the last boot option such that if Windows reboots for an update Linux does not start
- it allows to edit the cmdline of the kernel to recover a system that does not boot, e.g. start in single user mode. That can really save your day if you don&#x27;t have on hand an USB stick and another PC to flash it
- it allows you to choose between multiple kernels and initrd images easily, again for recovery purposes
- it has a voice for entering the UEFI setup menu: in most modern systems again entering the UEFI with a keyboard combination is unnecessarily difficult and has a too short timeout
- it allows you to boot any other EFI application, such as memtest, or efi shell. Most UEFI firmwares doesn&#x27;t have a menu to do so.</span>

                              <span>Really good post! I also found this quote which distilled their position in the 404media coverage of the situation.
&gt; “What I can say for sure is that TicketMaster and AXS have had every opportunity to support scam-free third party ticket resale and delivery platforms if they wished: By documenting their ticket QR code cryptography, and by exposing apps and APIs which would allow verification and rotation of ticket secrets,” Conduition told me in an email. “But they intentionally choose not to do so, and then they act all surprised-pikachu when 3rd party resale scams proliferate. They&#x27;re opting to play legal whack-a-mole with scammers instead of fixing the problem directly with better technology, because they make more money as a resale monopoly than as an open and secure ecosystem.”

                              <span>Our governmental methods of punishment for corporations strike me as lacking.  This seems similar to Wells Fargo, where ok, the company was fined, sued, made to pay restitution (somewhat) to victims.  But underlying it all, the culture and incentives at the company that produced the situation didn&#x27;t get fundamentally changed.   Which often perpetuates across specific leaders, boards, and is a part of what a company is -- and doesn&#x27;t just get replaced by removing one or two people.
What does it take?   You have to dismantle a company before it changes these kinds of deep-rooted issues?    Or can a government penalty call for that?  That is hard to achieve.  Who&#x27;s going to change the evaluation procedures that HR has in place to measure what rating or bonus you get this year?  That seems to me as important as who is CEO.
None of the penalties courts mete out (short of dissolution/fined into bankruptcy) seem to be able to achieve this level of change needed.</span>

Title: Primitive anarchy and the anti-alphabet
Date: Summer 2024
Source: Plastic in Utero issue #3

 The way I see it, primitive anarchy is a total challenge to the pacified social field. This means that it is multi-faceted and at once constructive and destructive. Sabotaging the horrors of deep sea mining or “artificial intelligence” requires a different approach than the rewilding of everyday life. Inasmuch as the anti-alphabet is a part of primitive anarchy, it belongs with efforts to rewild everyday life. From this perspective, I think what it does can be summarized in three theses, on which I’ll expand below: 
 1) The terms of the pacified social field – the nouns, verbs, and adjectives of everyday language – are not actually words. Language abolition is only a se…</span>

                              <span>One of my favorite childhood memories is eating watermelons in the summer. Not just the carnal joy of eating them — crunching the sweetness between my teeth and feeling the wetness run down my chin — but the rest of the process too. Watching my dad slap and thump the melons in the supermarket to pick a good one while my brother and I clowned around and mimicked him. Crowding around the cutting board to seeing if we split open a good one. And of course, the best part: spooning the first bite of dark red flesh from the center and watching the juice pour into the crater left behind.
A crate of watermelons greeted me at the supermarket last week and I decided I wanted to buy one for the first time, just to try it. After slapping a few cluelessly (are they supposed to talk back to you or something?) I pushed my cart to a corner and looked up how to pick a good watermelon. I ended up coming across this helpful graphic:

I don&#x27;t know what my dad was listening for when he tapped and slapped all those watermelons. Like with most things, I&#x27;m sure I asked him about it and promptly forgot his answer. In hindsight, I don&#x27;t think he was that good at choosing them, despite growing up on a farm, because he took home a number of watermelons that were pale and watery inside. And I&#x27;ve been thinking about that as I sprinkle tajín on my watermelon slices and drip pink juice on the counter, how he was probably winging it too, along with the rest of adult- and parenthood, the same way I was slapping watermelons at the market last week and feeling like a fool waiting to be found out.</span>

                              <span>I had dinner with a close friend yesterday.
Afterward, I sent a photo I took of her. She wrote back that she thought it looked awful. I replied that I thought it was beautiful, which I honestly did. I wrote that maybe it&#x27;s like hearing your voice; it always feels a little strange and &quot;ugly.&quot;
The thought lingered while I sat on the subway home…
Perhaps it&#x27;s the same phenomenon that happens when we&#x27;re dissatisfied with our writing. The observer and the observed are too close to each other to make a fair judgment. It&#x27;s like looking at a painting up close and thinking it looks terrible. It&#x27;s like a trial where the judge and the defendant are the same person.
We are in a constant state of bias when it comes to judging our work.
Anyone who&#x27;s been blogging for a while has experienced this: You post something you almost threw away because you thought it was garbage, and it turns out to be one of your most popular posts.
Bias.
Next time you find yourself with your index finger resting on the delete button, move it to publish. Your trash might be someone else’s treasure.</span>

A recent update has exposed an experimental media library in your Bear dashboard. It was committed two weeks ago, so this might be old news, but this is a considerable improvement for general ease of use.
The URL is https://bearblog.dev//dashboard/media/ and should look like this.

Pro Tip: Use the Customize Dashboard functionality to add a link in your footer for easy access.
Excellent work, Herman, as always!</span>

                              <span>I was on the board of directors for a local Linux Users Group and can echo the difficulties in finding a venue. In a city full of empty office spaces on a weekday night it was virtually impossible to find a stable meeting location. Without a stable meeting location you are much less likely to establish a core group since people do not like to have to learn how to get to different venues.
Mozilla hosted us at one point but the political tides changed there and we got kicked out. I think having strong buy in from someone in the C-suite of a company is the only real way to do it. Otherwise you are beholden to the changing winds of the company.
In the end we are now in a stable location in the local library, but only because we had someone on the inside. Previously when we approached the library we were stone walled without someone to grease the wheels.
I do believe that it should be a mandate for the municipality to provide meeting space for local non-profit and special interest groups. In many locations you can no longer pool some money with your buddies to buy a piece of land to build your clubhouse on. In my city there are many such clubs which were formed 50 years ago — the sailing club, the badminton club, the lawn bowling club, etc — but land is too scarce in many places now and we need the municipalities to pick up the slack.</span>

                              <span>Hi, I’m the author of the underlying quickjs-emscripten runtime library. I like your ergonomic kind of “standard library” for quickjs-emscripten :)
Did you try running in the browser or with a bundler? I think accepting the variant name as a string you pass to import(variantName) dynamically may not play well with Webpack et al.
EDIT: SECURITY WARNING: this library exposes the ability for the guest (untrusted) code to &#x60;fetch&#x60; with the same cookies as the host &#x60;fetch&#x60; function. You must not run untrusted code if enabling &#x60;fetch&#x60;. Library should come with a big blinking warning about what is safe and unsafe to enable when running untrusted code. It’s not a “sandbox” if the sandboxed code can call arbitrary HTTP APIs authenticated as the host context!
The reason quickjs-emscripten  is low-level and avoids magic is so I can confidently claim that the APIs it does provide are secure. I generally reject feature requests for magical serialization or easy network/filesystem access because that kind of code is a rich area for security mistakes. When you run untrusted code, you should carefully audit the sandbox itself, but also audit all the code you write to expose APIs to the sandbox.
In this case a comment from an other HN user asking about Fetch cookies tipped me off to the potential security issue.

                              <span>&gt; In 1544, physician and botanist Pietro Andrea Mattioli described the leaves as smelling like bed bugs or stink bugs...
Incredible that neither this, nor the other linked article, even mention the fact that this stink-bug/soap taste is genetically predetermined for some people [1], so above quote can by no means be taken as an argument that cilantro &quot;became unfashionable&quot; so authors started describing it negatively.
Instead, the real story is probably much more interesting, as the changes in cilantro popularity could probably be connected to waves of migrations and general genetic pool changes in a particular place.

Best place I ever worked.
This was “the Creo Philosophy”:
Our priority is to provide unique and sustainable value to our customers.
1. All decisions must be based on sound economics.
2. Key decisions are made in consensus, with full team agreement to accept and implement the decision.
3. We believe that people are most effective when self-managed.
4. Compensation is based on contribution, gauged largely by an annual peer review.
5. All employees share the wealth created by their hard work and innovation.
Creo was extremely proud of how “flat” the organization was but my primary take-away from there as an ex-employee is actually how important management is.
First and foremost, management created a shared vision of…</span>

                              <span>One of the most interesting discussions I&#x27;ve had around this was at a small company who mass-hired a bunch of people from a big company. We went round and round in circles for a while because of issues similar to what you&#x27;re describing. I ran a small 4-6 person hardware team (softly blurry on the edges) and the new people wanted significant amounts of design and documentation review as well as financial oversight. We needed $40 worth of solder and connectors and had to wait a week for PO approval as well as demonstrate that we had gotten multiple quotes... even though there was just a store down the block that sold exactly what we needed.
Anyway, after a month or two of this I started catching significant flak because my team was nowhere near as productive as it used to be. Complaining about slow POs was met with &quot;maybe you should plan better&quot;. Complaining about design reviews for one-off boards that would go from idea-to-problem solved was met with &quot;you&#x27;re engineers, you need to document your work&quot;. It was painful and I came very close to resigning.
What ultimately worked, though, was figuring out a catch phrase that spoke the language of the new people: &quot;accountability without authority&quot;. This ruffled some feathers but once I repeated &quot;you are trying to hold me accountable for delivering a $500,000 project on time but are not giving me authority to buy $40 worth of stuff to execute on that&quot; enough times it finally got through and the system started to change. But man did it suck for a while.</span>

                              <span>The difference in their geochemistry is substantial so even if chromium isn&#x27;t technically that much more abundant, it&#x27;s significantly easier to mine.
The Gibbs free energy of formation for chromium oxides and chromite is much more negative than for lithium-bearing minerals so Cr compounds are thermodynamically favored to precipitate out of melts and solutions, forming minerals with high concentrations that then get pushed up by other processes. Li+, with its lone valence electron, just doesn&#x27;t form strong bonds or highly stable mineral phases in comparison. On top of that the diffusion coefficients for Cr species in magmas and rocks are generally orders of magnitude lower than for Li. Cr gets locked into crystal structures early and stays put, while Li keeps migrating and diffusing in the form of water soluble minerals. There&#x27;s also a whole biogeochemical cycle for Cr involving microbes that can concentrate it in sediments.</span>
