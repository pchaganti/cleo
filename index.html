Immigration. A nation of immigrants, with dying main streets, empty classrooms, and labor shortages in key industries, is about to cast its votes based in large part on which candidate can best be trusted to reduce rates of both legal and illegal immigration.

                              <span>The launching of the widespread terror campaign targeting civilians in Lebanon is an integral part of the Israeli war strategy to achieve tactical military objectives. The new Israeli strikes which started on September 17 with the exploding pagers have resulted so far in more than 5000 killed and injured Lebanese.
For the past 11 months, the Lebanese Resistance limited its attacks exclusively to Israeli military bases, in or near, the &quot;Jewish-only&quot; colonies along the Lebanese border. The current Israeli assault was likely planned to take place on September 16 ahead of the aexplosion of the pagers, but had to be postponed due to an unforeseen clash with the visit of Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein. Consequently, Israel may have failed, either due to confusion or technical difficulties, to reprogram the pagers’ activation to another date. More

                              <span>This story starts a long time ago. My wife had just returned from Canada, had finished her PhD, and I was a Software Designer working for one of the founding companies of Silicon Valley, though I was based in Brazil.

I believe everyone here must know what depression is, right? Well, if you don’t know, you can click here and read more about it… Well, what probably some people don’t know is that there is chronic depression, meaning no matter how much you try to improve, change, take medication, find hobbies, or whatever the attempt may be; you will die with depression. And I’ve had it since I was 16, but I’m not going to tell you my age, right (I’m in my 20s, lol).
In the past, I have tried to kill myself, but I was saved by a guy who is a great friend, and at the time, I went to live at his house, to be away from everything and everyone, with my phone turned off, just studying 5/6 hours a day, creatin…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s about the narrative they tried to create. The spin. It doesn&#x27;t matter much if they were technically behaving as a for-profit entity previously. What matters is that they wanted the public (and likely, their talent) to _think_ that they weren&#x27;t even interested in making a profit as this would be a philosophical threat to the notion of any sort of impartial or even hopefully benevolent originator of AGI (a goal which is laid plainly in their mission statement).
As you&#x27;ve realized, this should have been (and was) obvious for a long time. But that doesn&#x27;t make it any less hypocritical or headline worthy.</span>

                              <span>The problem I have with this is simple and has to do with the lack of separation of entities.
Automattic is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.com is a competitor with WPEngine.
Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation IS NOT a competitor with WPEngine.
There is a dispute between Automattic and WPEngine. The resources of Wordpress.org and the Wordpress Foundation should not be leverage in this dispute.
The fact that those boundaries are crossed means that anyone who is in competition with Automattic might have any and all ecosystems that Matt has any control over leveraged against them if they upset Matt or Automattic in any way.
It is very poor taste and changes the perspective of the product. Instead of a professional entity who will engage professionally it is now a form of leverage that a single person could wield against anyone who crosses them.
To be clear these same exact actions can be taken against anyone who insults one individual. This look is embarrassing.</span>

                              <span>The most surprising thing to me in this is that the non-profit will still exist. Not sure what the point of it is anymore. Taken as a whole, OpenAI is now just a for-profit entity beholden to investors and Sam Altman as a shareholder. The non-profit is really just vestigial.
I guess technically it&#x27;s supposed to play some role in making sure OpenAI &quot;benefits humanity&quot;. But as we&#x27;ve seen multiple times, whenever that goal clashes with the interests of investors, the latter wins out.</span>

                              <span>Software is a house. The more you lean into the analogy, the better.
I often tell clients &quot;The first thing you asked me to do was to move a dining room chair into the living room. Then you asked me to do the same with the toilet. The latter only works if we tear out all the plumbing.&quot;
Non-coders seem to understand these analogies intuitively.</span>

 Jean-Baptiste Vidalou, “We Are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle” (Cambridge: Polity, 2023) 
 It’s shameful. The original French publication of We are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle by Jean-Baptiste Vidalou was in my hands since April 2018. Frequently described as “the French Seeing Like a State,” the book explores the art of state making in France.

                              <span>I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how capable the new 1B model is, considering it&#x27;s just a 1.3GB download (for the Ollama GGUF version).
I tried running a full codebase through it (since it can handle 128,000 tokens) and asking it to summarize the code - it did a surprisingly decent job, incomplete but still unbelievable for a model that tiny: https://gist.github.com/simonw/64c5f5b111fe473999144932bef42...
More of my notes here: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/llama-32/
I&#x27;ve been trying out the larger image models to using the versions hosted on https://lmarena.ai/ - navigate to &quot;Direct Chat&quot; and you can select them from the dropdown and upload images to run prompts.</span>

The letter was carefully crafted by OpenAI&#x27;s PR team under strict direction from Sam and the board. Whatever the real story is is sitting under many layers of NDAs and threats of clawing back/diluting her shares, and we will not know it for a long time. What I can say for certain is no executive in her position ever willingly resigns to pursue different passions/spend more time with their family/enjoy retirement or whatever else.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to have missed this part of the story in all the chaos, but from the NYTimes in March:
Ms. Murati wrote a private memo to Mr. Altman raising questions about his management and also shared her concerns with the board. That move helped to propel the board’s decision to force him out.
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/technology/openai-executi...
It should be no surprise if Sam Altman wants executives who opposed his leadership, like Mira and Ilya, out of the company. When you&#x27;re firing a high-level executive in a polite way, it&#x27;s common to let them announce their own departure and frame it the way they want.</span>

                              <span>Thee are a bunch of comments here asking why one would run Windows on a spacecraft.
I am a spacecraft engineer. I don’t see anything in the linked article indicating that they are actually running Windows - the BSOD claim is tongue-in-cheek, or at least that’s how I read it. I also don’t know of anyone anywhere that runs Windows on a spacecraft, with the exception of laptops used by astronauts. Typically one runs vxWorks, or maybe QNX. Some experimental (high risk, low cost) systems run Linux. Older spacecraft don&#x27;t run any OS at all, everything is running on bare metal, and that may be true for a handful of current spacecraft as well.
Windows is used in some places by ground controllers, but these days they tend to be running Linux a lot more often.</span>

                              <span>&gt; &quot;I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.&quot;
This is now to me the &quot;old school&quot; internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don&#x27;t blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly &quot;Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?&quot;
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it&#x27;s been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don&#x27;t participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these &quot;professional&quot; creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.</span>

                              <span>In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.</span>

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

(A) Helpfully&quot; display links/images where the URL is  exfiltrating data from the current user&#x27;s conversation.
(B) Confidently slandering a target individual (or group) as convicted of murder, suggesting that police ought to shoot first in order to protect their own lives.

I received an email from Google today with the subject line &quot;Meet the new Google TV Streamer (4K)&quot;
The sender was Google Chromecast. Apparently it&#x27;s some sort of streaming hardware they are selling for £99.
I won&#x27;t even consider buying one. How long until it&#x27;s an obsolete brick? And when it&#x27;s a brick, what are the chances I can wipe it and install my own software on it? Probably zero.
No thanks, Google. You&#x27;ve blotched your copybook too many times.</span>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary dream…</span>

DJ: What is Anarchism? 
JZ: I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination. This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…</span>

                              <span>Hey,
How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …</span>

                              <span>five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn&#x27;t really my choice; the doctor said that they could &quot;try to do some creative billing,&quot; but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i&#x27;m away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i&#x27;m living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i&#x27;ve met so many wonderful friends. i&#x27;ve lost a few. i&#x27;ve bought a car. i&#x27;ve gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i&#x27;ve had more than a few mental health episodes... i&#x27;ve also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i&#x27;ve learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what&#x27;ll happen in the next five!</span>

                              <span>I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.
I don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.
I have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.
this isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.
I don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?
but it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.
do what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.
on my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m currently on the hunt for a job. I was previously in a decently paid if incredibly monotonous QA job and while the firing sucked, I wasn&#x27;t particularly distraught over it: I went to work there mainly because there was a lot of downtime and it gave me time to do homework and prepare for tests, so I didn&#x27;t have to pick between school and work, and instead do school at work. Beyond that, it was fairly dead-end job and once I was approaching graduation I started looking for greener, brighter pastures.  &quot;Maybe a gaming job,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;or just a regular backend gig. I&#x27;m sure I can find some sort of junior position to slot into in no time at all.&quot;
That was about four months ago and now my standards are somewhere along the Mariana Trench.

Soften the glue and pull out the back – hmm, I guess it&#x27;s doable if I can find replacement glue.
Disconnect dozens of cables and parts – wow, it&#x27;s going to be hard to remember how everything goes back together.
Peel off protective foam from motherboard – is it even possible to replace this stuff?
CNC grind the existing 128GB NAND to dust – I should probably stop watching now...</span>

                              <span>In 1676 Roemer estimated the speed of light by timing the orbit of Jupiter’s moon Io, noting that as the Earth approached Jupiter, Io emerged from behind Jupiter a little earlier every day, and as the Earth traveled away from Jupiter it appeared a little later every day, with the time of day varying by 22 minutes over a year. Knowing the difference between the two distances, he reckoned that light travels that distance in 22 minutes, or 227 thousand km/s. The actual speed is about 300 thousand km/s. Not bad!</span>

                              <span>&gt; If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don’t build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people.
Translation for the rest of us: &quot;we need to fully privatize the OA subsidiary and turn it into a B-corp which can raise a lot more capital over the next decade, in order to achieve the goals of the nonprofit, because the chief threat is not anything like existential risk from autonomous agents in the next few years or arms races, but inadequate commercialization due to fundraising constraints&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Common Crawl is shown in their screen shot of &quot;Providers&quot; along side OpenAI and Antropic. The challenge is that Common Crawl is used for a lot of things that are not AI training. For example, it&#x27;s a major source of content for the Wayback machine.
In fact, that&#x27;s the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone&#x27;s site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).
There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don&#x27;t, and that applied whether they are bots or people.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I would have thought about privately disclosing these findings to Dotpe. But all the API requests are right there in plain sight...
There are pretty common ethical standards about disclosing vulnerabilities privately before disclosing them publicly. I don&#x27;t see how the obviousness of the vulnerability changes the situation. By warning the company, you give them the opportunity to remedy the problem before announcing to the world that anyone with a laptop can exploit it. Probably they were just hoping that nobody would notice, which is stupid of course, but now they don&#x27;t have the chance to build up a better wall before the flood of fake orders that could cause real harm to the small businesses whose financial information you disclosed online.
Perhaps I&#x27;m being too optimistic about how the company would respond, but I still think it&#x27;s hard to justify not doing a private disclosure.</span>

I’ve not… really… spent a lot of energy thinking of a “my time on Cohost” retrospective post like some folks have done (which have all been a pleasure to read!) because I’m not sure I really can. I think it’s easy to pick apart the stuff that’s individually made Cohost such a wonderful place to exist on, and certainly added to the greater whole of the thing, but trying to sum up everything into A Post feels impossible. How do you sum up years of emotion and attachment in a way that’s, like, understandable to others outside your specific lived experience on a website built to let the individual tailor it to their desires.
I tried tackling some of it in my last blog post in a more pointed manner. I’ve been spending a lot more time sorta doomer-think…</span>

It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.
I’ll give you an example.

                              <span>”In your darkest hour, what saved you? What helped you find the strength to carry on?”
These are the questions posed by Matthew Graybosch for September&#x27;s IndieWeb Carnival, Power Underneath Despair.
My darkest moment in life occurred about five years ago. For a long time, I understood that something wasn&#x27;t right, but refused to accept it — both for those around me and for myself.
&quot;I&#x27;m handling this myself! I won’t let anyone think there’s something wrong with me, ever. I got this!&quot;
I tried weight training, yoga, meditation, running, seeking spirituality, reading books, attending online events, going on retreats…
While these activities provided some temporary relief, they weren&#x27;t enough. My issues ran deeper. I needed professional help but had the foolish belief that seeking it was a sign o…</span>

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it&#x27;s because i need to promote something or i&#x27;m reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don&#x27;t like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn&#x27;t; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed &quot;posting&quot; on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr&#x27;s design the most) so i&#x27;m unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i&#x27;ll ask them. if i&#x27;m gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i&#x27;ll message them instead of posting into the void.
it&#x27;s all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on because you&#x27;re shouting into the void and they&#x27;re not in it, but you don&#x27;t actively talk to them because there&#x27;s this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i&#x27;m pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i&#x27;m looking forward to never thinking about social media again.</span>

Introductions
Arvind: Hello, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you
like to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with
Kubernetes?
Kensei: Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada
(@sanposhiho), a software engineer at
Tetrate.io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more
than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG-Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of
two SIG subprojects,
kube-scheduler-simulator and
kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…</span>

Title: The Making of the Spanish CNT-IWA (2010–2024)
Date: September 21, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 23rd September 2024 from libcom.org

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT. A split of almost an entire internal current which fought for control of the Confederation by all possible means, and eventually failed. In short, this is why it ended up outside. This (rather incomplete) article resumes the story of that conflict as seen through the eyes of what is now the CNT (CIT). 
The Cordoba Congress, 2010

                              <span>Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).</span>

This add-on for the Bearming theme allows you to include buttons for emailing, printing, and sharing your blog posts on social media (see examples at the bottom of this page).
To use the add-on, which requires the latest version of the Bearming theme (1.3), add the code below to the end of your posts. If you prefer to avoid adding it manually each time, paste the code into your post template (Bear dashboard -&gt; Posts -&gt; Edit template).

mail Email
 print Print
 share Share


Then add the following style to your theme:
/* Share buttons */
.share {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
}
.share li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 7px;
  line-height: 41px;
}
.share a {
  padding: 6px 10px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  text-decoration: none;
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
.share a:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.material-icons {
  font-family: &#x27;Material Icons&#x27;;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  vertical-align: text-top;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-feature-settings: &#x27;liga&#x27;;
}

That&#x27;s it! I hope your readers find this feature useful.

It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t enjoy an occasional adventure—I do. It&#x27;s just that I am very happy to have a nice time in my own home, surrounded by the things I&#x27;ve already accumulated that bring me pleasure. It was only as a teenager that I felt that restless call to get out and get away from home to experience something besides the same old, same old.
Granted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I&#x27;ve been to a few really enjoy…</span>

I bought a new camera this week. Or, at least, a refurbished one, purchased on impulse as part of a mad scramble to fill my life with things to do that don&#x27;t involve looking at a computer.
This isn&#x27;t my first flirtation with photography. A brief obsession with the fantastic Umurangi Generation pushed me to pick up a cheap Centon df300 a few years back. I love film, I really do; the warm texture of shots, the ritual of getting it developed, the unpredictability of how things will turn out. But between the cost and time it took to see the results and the technical fussiness of keeping a decades-old handheld working, I slowly began to fall off.

                              <span>Today, 21 September, Sri Lanka will hold its first presidential election since the July 2022 popular uprising known officially declared the worst economic crisis in the country in 73 years. Most foreign debt repayments were suspended after two years of money printing to support tax cuts. The economy contracted 7.8% and the percentage of the population earning less than $3.65 a day doubled to around 25% of the population.
