                              <span>&gt; Even my last team leader sent me a message out of the blue saying “I think I’ll run a bar. I want to be a bartender and listen to other people’s stories, not figure out why protobuf doesn’t deserialize data that worked JUST FINE for the past three years”.
I worked at a bar when I was young, listened to the stories; the most annoying protobuf deserialization issues or &#x27;Agile meetings&#x27; are freaking fun compared to the most of the stories you can hear.
This is just comparing apples to oranges. Woodworking or any other hobby that you enjoy will be more pleasing than any real job you will do. Programming is fun, that is why you started doing it. Working as software developer can be less so.</span>

                              <span>Most of the people I know who pursue creative/crafting hobbies alongside a software development job have chosen to work for well-known big companies, for prestige and safety, and ended up unfulfilled in their jobs.
Most big companies are not good if you want to solve problems and build stuff. Especially &quot;the enterprise&quot;, where software is seen as a cost center so the less of it the better. The effort of managing up eats a creative person&#x27;s soul.
I want the clarity of being able to talk to &quot;the boss/the customer&quot; and solve their problems and get paid the market rate for my skills. Not prepare endless PowerPoints for my skip-level, who has no ownership but has to act in their own best interests in a swamp of principal-agent problems.
This is why I am very happy at a fast-growing small tech company where one can have honest conversations about the customer and the product. How do other people deal with this?</span>

I was pushing him in the stroller while he was napping, and at the orangutan exhibit, one came up to the window and gestured towards the stroller.
I turned the stroller to face the window, and removed the hood.
The orangutan blew my son a kiss, waved then went back to the otherside of its enclosure.
Made me rethink what I knew about animal intelligence.</span>

                              <span>The increasing dominance of large firms in the United States has raised concerns about pricing power in the product market. The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span>

                              <span>As Israel began its genocide in Gaza, those who manage U.S. colleges and universities also commenced to issue statements of outrage at what Hamas had done. And as campus protests erupted in condemnation of the slaughter of Gazans, and especially children, and the destruction of homes and every major institution, including hospitals, these same institutions of higher learning began to disrupt these protests and bring them to an end. As a former college teacher, one who witnessed the attacks on those who protested against the War in Vietnam and who studied the repression on campuses during the McCarthy period, I became so appalled at what was being done to our brave and courageous college students that I began to write letters to the leaders of what are, in reality, academic enterprises.

- most current LLMs are trained on large amounts of web data that itself contains facts, opinions, and misinformation. These things are treated equally, so I would expect the LLM to get common facts right, but also to represent opinions or misinformation as facts when they are pervasive.
- LLMs &quot;hallucinate&quot; and tend not to know when to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or to not try to fact-check something that is not factual in nature.
...in short, I would expect LLMs to be an unreliable fact checker, which has the potential to do as much harm as good.</span>

                              <span>I will always remember what one of my previous bosses told me.
I had built this whole E-Commerce platform for him and his company (I single-handedly did all the coding, infrastructure, etc. Not taking any credit for their incredible sales team.) that was running in multiple countries, bringing in millions in sales.
But I started getting pretty bored once it was stable enough and just running and started seeking greener pastures.
And he said (I&#x27;m paraphrasing) most people are either builders or maintainers, and rarely both. And he said I was a builder at heart. So I hate maintaining things. Which is why, when I helped hire my replacement, he was VERY much a maintainer, and he flourished in that second phase since it had reached maturity.
Using that framework, I think that the ratio of builders to maintainers at Tesla is not healthy right now. It seems VERY healthy at SpaceX, for example. They&#x27;re innovating on new technology AND on efficiencies of the existing tech and logistics.
The builders got them to where they are (I&#x27;m still a generally happy Model 3 owner), but the maintainers are the ones who make the maintenance and service experience great, incrementally improve manufacturing, parts availability, all those unsexy things that have more to do with logistics, building superchargers etc.
Because they are too lopsided with builders, they keep inventing new stuff instead of continuing to innovate with EVs. For a while there were enough builder type challenges with manufacturing but even those challenges seem to be exhausted.
I&#x27;m surprised to see that they&#x27;ve gutted the supercharger team because it seems like the ultimate &quot;services&quot; sector where they&#x27;re in better shape than anyone else to make basically free &quot;services&quot; type money from ALL EVs in coming years with NACS.</span>

                              <span>You know, I have to hand it to Elon.  We often hear about how successful companies turn &quot;corporate&quot; and stop being able to innovate because they need to preserve their successful product lines; e.g. Google&#x27;s ad business.  And the leadership in those companies often talk about how they want to &quot;be a big company that acts like a startup&quot; but it&#x27;s usually just lip service.  Well, this is what it actually looks like and it&#x27;s not pretty; even the customers hate it let alone the employees.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to feel optimistic about Tesla these days. Musk is gutting the company while dangling bizarre and wildly unrealistic promises in front of shareholders (releasing Optimus robot, self driving taxis, licensing self driving tech, training AI models on all Tesla cars, launching unnamed cheaper product lines – all by the end of the year). This will get a short term stock price boost and probably get his $56 billion pay package approved, but when then? Who saves Tesla from reality after Musk gets his money and checks out?</span>

- They&#x27;ve set the generated page to be uncachable with max-age&#x3D;0 (https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cac...)
- nginx is clearly not caching dynamic resources (currently 22s (not ms) to respond)

                              <span>I quickly skimmed the paper, got inspired to simplify it, and created some Pytorch Layer :
https://github.com/GistNoesis/FourierKAN/
The core is really just a few lines.
In the paper they use some spline interpolation to represent 1d function that they sum. Their code seemed aimed at smaller sizes. Instead I chose a different representation, aka fourier coefficients that are used to interpolate the functions of individual coordinates.
It should give an idea of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks representation power, it should probably converge easier than their spline version but spline version have less operations.
Of course, if my code doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t mean theirs doesn&#x27;t.
Feel free to experiment and publish paper if you want.</span>

                              <span>Improvement ideas: let the user set their country. If I live in Germany, and I don&#x27;t want to bother with VPN, knowing that a TV show is available in Argentina and 30 other countries is not important.
Also, I don&#x27;t think this takes care of the case where some seasons of a show is available but not the others. Maybe that&#x27;s also the reason for false negatives in some cases (others mentioned this).
Another thing: be able to search by subtitles and audio. In our household, we speak three languages, and I can&#x27;t watch shows in 2 out of 3 with the standard location. It&#x27;s also great for people learning languages (common VPN pitch).
Overall, great stuff! 
The mobile view&#x27;s information density is very low, I can see 1.7 tiles, so I always need to scroll.
Tapping on the tiles doesn&#x27;t do anything apart from changing the background.
Some more preset selections would be nice like &quot;Sitcom&quot;.
Recommendations based on the selected movie would be also great, for example when I&#x27;m watching HIMYM, I&#x27;d not mind seeing where Friends is available (it&#x27;s basically the same jokes but a decade apart with different actors).</span>

I&#x27;ve spent more than 10 years now building Soundslice, which does web-based sheet music rendering. I believe we were the first to do &quot;responsive&quot; web notation (that part of the site launched in 2014).
Here&#x27;s a tech talk I gave with a lot of details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XH5EtQge_Bg
Here&#x27;s an example of responsive Soundslice notation: https://www.soundslice.com/slices/zzNlc/ (in the settings, set the stave width to maximum to get &quot;Fit to screen&quot; for the true responsive effect)
We&#x27;ve got a whole suite of tools built around this, including an excellent web-based editor, rich practice functionality and a relatively new scanning feature (extracting the musical data from a photo or PDF).
I agree with other commenters here that this CSS Grid approach could be handy for lightweight projects but it likely isn&#x27;t up to snuff for the incredibly subtle and complex world of full scores. With that said, I just want to stress again that this is super cool and I&#x27;m glad it exists!</span>

                              <span>The Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
acts as the main connection between the kubelet
and the Container Runtime.
Those runtimes have to provide a gRPC server which has to
fulfill a Kubernetes defined Protocol Buffer interface.
This API definition
evolves over time, for example when contributors add new features or fields are
going to become deprecated.
In this blog post, I&#x27;d like to dive into the functionality and history of three
extraordinary Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are truly outstanding in
terms of how they work: Exec, Attach and PortForward.
Exec can be used to run dedicated commands within the container and stream
the output to a client like kubectl or
crictl. It also allows interaction with
that process using standard input (stdin), for example if users want t…</span>

They patented inhalers for a second time.  It&#x27;s the exact same drug.  The only thing that changed was the propellant.  It went from R-12 to R-134a.  Everyone who had to switch out R-12 from refrigeration to drug manufacturing switched to R-134a.  There was absolutely _nothing_ novel about it.
It was _criminal_ to allow them the second patent for just the propellant change.  It took generic $5 inhalers off the market and replaced them with $95 inhalers.  It was was one of the most corrupt swindles I&#x27;ve ever personally seen.</span>

                              <span>Weed being illegal on a federal level has had some interesting effects. Because of these laws, all legal weed has to be grown, processed, and retailed within a single state. So much industry and local employment has been created by the legal barriers in place.
It’s probably still a net positive to release the federal restriction, but I hope all these small/mid sized businesses don’t get gulped up by big tobacco or other mega corps</span>

Having worked on multiple very large Go codebases with many engineers, the lack of actual enums and a built-in optional type instead of nil drive me crazy.
I think I&#x27;m in love.

Looks like last commit was 7 months ago. Was this abandoned, or considered feature complete? I hope it&#x27;s not abandoned!</span>

Google is failing, so users start putting &quot;Reddit&quot; on the ends of their search results. Where do we go when Reddit is no longer useful and contains the same AI generated dreck as all the Google search results? It shows how many single points of failure there are on the informational web. Pretty much the only informational resource on the web that&#x27;s still unscathed is Wikipedia (thanks herculean-level efforts by its editors, mind you), but I wouldn&#x27;t bank on it in the same way I wouldn&#x27;t bank on Reddit.

- longhauls cancelled because obvious infrastructure limitations.  batteries and motors failing more frequently due to the load and the range.  reports of using tesla consumer vehicle components in the drivetrain.  switch to regional routes
- regional routes failing between AZ/CA due to thermal and performance issues.  range issues.

                              <span>With the release of Kubernetes 1.30, the feature to prevent the modification of the volume mode
of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

                              <span>With the exception of a brief period, India has been more fortunate than many other nations in being able to maintain parliamentary rule over the last 77 years. With 900 million voters—more than the populations of Europe and Australia put together—the Indian elections are hailed as the largest exhibition and celebration of democracy. The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

We identified four channels by which surplus value flows to the imperialist countries: currency (...)

Configuration to beta.
Today&#x27;s article is about authorization: deciding what someone can and cannot

Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking

Motivation
Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible
authentication system. The current system, while powerful, has some limitations

Workflow runs can cost as much as hundreds of thousands of US dollars. Given this large scale, scientists want to estimate the projected cost of their genomics workflow runs before deciding to launch them. In Part 6 of this series, […]</span>

As expected, there were no changes to the neoliberal policies promoted and imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions. A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.
A container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let&#x27;s explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can&#x27;t you just use docker
containers for building cloud?
The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.

start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.
Why complicate things? - after all, …</span>
