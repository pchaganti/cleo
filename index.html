Any rock music fan worthy of being considered as such knows that the Pacific Northwest was a major focal point of the music in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, a sound the industry called grunge began there. Essentially, grunge is punk rock with a lot more fuzz and a few more hooks in the melody lines. In its artistic heyday, so-called punk bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney, the Melvins and TAD played clubs, dorm rooms, basements, bars and art galleries in their quest for the fulfillment playing music brings. Somewhere along the line, the media and industry recognized the phenomenon and labeled it grunge. Some of the bands were able to make a living at it and some became incredibly wealthy—something which wasn’t necessarily the best (or the intended) outcome. Other bands brought in other sounds and styles to the music and the scene it created. Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell brought in his version of a soaring and melodic metal guitar; Bikini Kill and Mecca Normal brought in a feminist anger and a legion of female fans. The Gits did a bit of everything and, in doing so, stood alone in the scene; they weren’t grunge, metal, or riot grrl. Their singer Mia Zapata had a voice that sometimes sounded a little like Pat Benatar, sometimes a little like Patti Smith, and sometimes like that folksinger you heard one afternoon in the park. Comparisons barely help describe her singing because it remained distinctly her own. The guitar of Joe Spleen, the bass of Matt Dresdner, and the percussion section that included Bob Lee, Bruce Docheneaux and Steven Moriarty completed the sound.

This violated an agreement the Navajos thought they had with Energy Fuels, Inc. (EFI), federal and state agencies that required a two-week advance notice before hauling uranium ore through the Nation. It also violated a Navajo law that denied any hauling of radioactive material through the Nation, but Arizona and the feds declared their control over the route. More

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…</span>

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12. His trade was house painting and wallpaper hanging, but as we shall see, he was an able polemicist and poet; his words were a shot of adrenaline to ra…</span>

 Until today, we knew that the mechanisms of repression of the state and capital were the army, the police, the schools, the psychiatric hospitals. Now we know that along with them have been added the Greek Cypriot ‘rapprochement’ state intellectuals and social-patriots. How else could we explain the fact that these gentlemen invite representatives from all the supposedly re-reunificationist areas to such a meeting — for represe…</span>

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…</span>

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…</span>

Title: Get a Job!
Subtitle: On the Usefulness of Jobs and Small Businessess for Illegalist Anarchists

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target. 
 Socialist anarchists, on the other hand, are willing to engage in legitimate work, seeing it …</span>

 “Is it possible to exercise rulership righteously: without killing and without instigating others to kill, without confiscating and without instigating others to confiscate, without sorrowing and without causing sorrow?” 
 -The Buddha, SN 4.20 [1]
Introduction
 Buddhist Anarchism is a synthesis of Anarchism from Buddhist Religion. Buddhism is a religion over 2,500 years old that teaches people to free themselves from Dukkha (suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness) through practicing Sila, Samadhi and Panya (Virtue, Concentration and Wisdom) and achieving nibbana (enlightenment, freedom from dukkha).

5 jobs later, its been the same at any company that isn&#x27;t a startup. Execs have never been in the office, they have &quot;offsite&quot; meetings.</span>

The problem is that government doesn’t have a line, that line is defined by the resistance it faces. Today it might be people sharing MP3s, tomorrow they will come after you for hosting a parody of mickey mouse. 10 years from now they’ll be busting down doors for sharing illegal memes (Seems to already be the case in the UK).
Sitting by passively and praying that the system will come to its senses is a fool’s errand. Copyright holders, the government, and powerful interests are entities that have no problem playing dirty.</span>

I know it&#x27;s not as popular or sexy as it used to be, but the whole point of a foundation like Apache was to avoid these situations, even more than the way the Linux Foundation is setup. Apache _explicitly_ manages projects to avoid these downsides.
- Single corporation ownership. Projects cannot get out of the Incubator unless they demonstrate a diverse and healthy community. That doesn&#x27;t mean popular, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean best-in-class, but it means that there shouldn&#x27;t be just one entity backing a project.
- Membership in Apache is _personal_ not a seat for a given company. If you&#x27;re a committer on an Apache project and you move jobs, you&#x27;re _still_ a committer on that project
- The Foundation owns the trademarks. There have been fights about this in the past, but the whole idea is that the _community_ owns the name, so some corporation can&#x27;t claim to be the sole or official owner by naming their company or product after the open source product.
The core premise of the Apache Software Foundation is community over code, that healthy, diverse communities have a better chance of standing the test of time than open source projects backed by a single individual or company. That&#x27;s the thesis at least.
The is starkly different from several other foundations, notably the Linux Foundation or Eclipse Foundation which are modeled more around industry consortiums.
Both models have their place, but I believe Apache better models the core values many of us feel strongly about when it comes to free and open source software.</span>

                              <span>It seems that whenever an open source project is run by a VC-backed company, it sooner or later ends up like this.  Increasingly it seems that &quot;open source&quot; is just the teaser to get people interested and then when investors want revenue growth, the rug gets pulled.

                              <span>I understand the goal, and the perceived abuse of the Core edition. But the problem with the Enterprise edition is that it&#x27;s quite expensive, &quot;contact us&quot; salesy, and it feels like taking a bite of this edition is possibly getting into bed with a future Oracle/landlord type of relationship where you end up squeezed by your database vendor.
The Core offering made this palatable, one could fallback to Core features if the relationship with Cockroach Labs degraded, which made it possible to entertain the Enterprise license since there&#x27;s was a way to walk back from it. But now there&#x27;s no such mitigation available. By using non-PG native features, users of the Enterprise edition are accepting to get in bed with Cockroach Labs for effectively forever (databases), a single provider that has no competition.
I think this may backfire, as it now seems imprudent to go all in on Cockroach Labs. They may be nice folks today, but who knows who will run the place in 5y when the next round of squeeze comes?
I wish them the best, they&#x27;re a great team and I always liked the project and toyed with it for years, and currently am involved with a paid Enterprise license. But this change in the dynamics is really giving me pause.
Getting in bed with a single vendor for an incredibly sticky tool comes with a _lot_ of risk. It took at least 17y for Amazon to get rid of its last Oracle database: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-...</span>

                              <span>Kubernetes 1.29 introduced new fields MatchLabelKeys and MismatchLabelKeys in PodAffinity and PodAntiAffinity.
In Kubernetes 1.31, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity) gets enabled by default.
MatchLabelKeys - Enhanced scheduling for versatile rolling updates
During a workload&#x27;s (e.g., Deployment) rolling update, a cluster may have Pods from multiple versions at the same time.
However, the scheduler cannot distinguish between old and new versions based on the LabelSelector specified in PodAffinity or PodAntiAffinity. As a result, it will co-locate or disperse Pods regardless of their versions.
This can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcome, for example:
New version Pods are co-located with old version Pods (PodAffinity), which will ev…</span>

                              <span>PersistentVolume (or PVs for short) are
associated with Reclaim Policy.
The reclaim policy is used to determine the actions that need to be taken by the storage
backend on deletion of the PVC Bound to a PV.
When the reclaim policy is Delete, the expectation is that the storage backend
releases the storage resource allocated for the PV. In essence, the reclaim
policy needs to be honored on PV deletion.
With the recent Kubernetes v1.31 release, a beta feature lets you configure your
cluster to behave that way and honor the configured reclaim policy.
How did reclaim work in previous Kubernetes releases?
PersistentVolumeClaim (or PVC for short) is
a user&#x27;s request for storage. A PV and PVC are considered Bound
if a newly created PV or a matching PV is found. The PVs themselves are

Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) use cases in the future. While the
project has been designed to fulfill microservice architectures in the past,
it’s now time to listen to the end users and introduce features which have a
stronger focus on AI/ML.
One of these requirements is to support Open Container Initiative (OCI)
compatible images and artifacts (referred as OCI objects) directly as a native
volume source. This allows users to focus on OCI standards as well as enables
them to store and distribute any content using OCI registries. A feature like
this gives the Kubernetes project a chance to grow into use cases which go
beyond running particular images.
Given that, the Kubernetes community is proud to present…</span>

Long-term nominal contracts, other labour market frictions, imperfection in credit markets, all these and more are prayed in aid and, […]</span>

                              <span>I haven’t been feeling well the past few days. I have been feverishly urging myself with tasks throughout the day so I can get my mind off things. Better be productive than dwell with my thoughts, right?
This post isn&#x27;t a vent, but a candid depiction of the reality of living with depression. (And sometimes I have this strange notion, that perhaps I am helping someone out there also battling depression.)
Recently, I have been forcing myself to leave the house. Depression tries to trick me, to convince me: What will change if you go out? This happens every time I am stuck in the depression loop (as I like to call it). Out of bitterness, I would challenge myself to step out the house for two minutes, then I am free to hide back inside. But the moment I step out, I immediately feel better, and…</span>

The Millennial generation is huge on nostalgia. Here are some of the highlights I remember from growing up in the 1990s.
Fashion
Butterfly hair clips.
Gel bracelets, the more the better... mostly in black and red.
Tattoo chokers -- although I think these are making a comeback amongst the Gen Zs?
White eyeliner -- I&#x27;m not sure why I ever thought this looked good on me, but I tried.
Studded belts worn sideways.
Those milky gel pens that we&#x27;d use to draw/write on ourselves. I remember writing I &lt;3 and the initials of that week&#x27;s crush.
Music

                              <span>I found out a couple of days ago that one of the people I communicate with regularly on Mastodon, a fellow by the name of Jim Mitchell (@jimmitchell@mastodon.social) was the creator of an app I used to use back in the day called YASU, Yet Another System Utility. I was fairly surprised to have my real life and my IndyWeb life collide like that. Jim and I are about the same age and have had some similar life experiences, facts we know because we&#x27;ve read each other&#x27;s blogs.(Jim&#x27;s Blog) It just felt good to have two parts of my life meet each other like that.
Ten years ago I discovered the community of Apple People who were separate from the company. A lot of them were podcasters like David Sparks and the guys from the Accidental Tech Podcast, John Siracusa, Casey Liss and Marco Arment. There …</span>

                              <span>Volumes in Kubernetes have been described by two attributes: their storage class, and
their capacity. The storage class is an immutable property of the volume, while the
capacity can be changed dynamically with volume
resize.
This complicates vertical scaling of workloads with volumes. While cloud providers and
storage vendors often offer volumes which allow specifying IO quality of service
(Performance) parameters like IOPS or throughput and tuning them as workloads operate,
Kubernetes has no API which allows changing them.
We are pleased to announce that the VolumeAttributesClass
KEP,
alpha since Kubernetes 1.29, will be beta in 1.31. This provides a generic,
Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO.
Like all new volume features in Kubernetes, this API is…</span>

                              <span>Kubernetes is renowned for its robust orchestration of containerized applications,
but as clusters grow, the demands on the control plane can become a bottleneck.
A key challenge has been ensuring strongly consistent reads from the etcd datastore,
requiring resource-intensive quorum reads.
Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a major improvement:
consistent reads from cache, graduating to Beta in Kubernetes v1.31.
Why consistent reads matter
Consistent reads are essential for ensuring that Kubernetes components have an accurate view of the latest cluster state.
Guaranteeing consistent reads is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of Kubernetes operations,
enabling components to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

Once you find something that works, double down! shove!
for me writing is a tool for crystallizing thought. a snapshot of how I would describe a topic in my own words at that point in time. There are 3 ways I see this as useful:
It&#x27;s powerful like how any picture at any point in time is. Like a picture, you can see progress (taking the delta of the snapshot and some future point). Plus, as you continue to write, you have a body of work to point to that monotonically increases1.

He was about to throw the container from a burned-out tea light when he thought, &quot;I can make something out of that.&quot; He had made several different versions, and when I complimented him on its beauty and cleverness, he replied:
It&#x27;s nothing special. You just have to see it.
Indeed, you just have to see it. Like a sculptor who views a block of stone and envisions an elephant, then removes only what isn&#x27;t an elephant.
This &quot;seeing&quot; isn&#x27;t limited to creative pursuits. The same principle applies to how we perceive our surroundings and life circumstances. Our mindset makes a world of difference.
My boss always concludes his morning emails with &quot;Make yourself a good day.&quot; We possess that power if we choose to use it. Life in a castle can be a living hell, and life in a hut can be pure bliss.

Nick agrees, writing:
Right? It&#x27;s a cool idea, just not for me. I&#x27;ve read a ton of solid posts on that feed but I&#x27;m personally not great under pressure. Over the last couple weeks I&#x27;ve posted so many things I end up deleting a couple hours later because they felt rushed.

I&#x27;d also suggest maybe adding the channel names (like the comment you posted here) to the app itself (although i think it&#x27;s cool when it&#x27;s unnamed and you get the old-school feeling of channels just being numbers).
Also, I&#x27;d love to have permalinks for the channels. Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you&#x27;re watching right now.
Another thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called &quot;SoundFixer&quot; that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it&#x27;s super distracting), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they&#x27;re embedded. I don&#x27;t know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It&#x27;s probably too niche and hard to do though.
Also I don&#x27;t seem to find any volume control except mute?</span>

                              <span>The technology is impressive; achieving such a level requires a lot of efforts in dataset creation, neural architectural costs, and GPU shepherding.
What is the company’s ethical position though? It officially stemmed from Mr Musk’s objection that OpenAI was not open-source, but it too is not open-source. It followed Mr Musk’s letter to stop all AI development on frontier models, but it is a frontier model. It followed complaints that OpenAI trained on tweets, but it also trained on tweets.
Companies like Meta, Mistral, or DeepSeek, address those complaints better, and all now play in the big league.</span>

                              <span>The bug in the legal system is that by filing this motion/claim, Disney can only win.
In the unlikely best case, they get the case dismissed, but even in the most likely case that the motion is denied, they win by wearing down their opponent who has much more limited resources and is personally affected by the case dragging out, i.e. more likely to accept a (lower) settlement than without this tactic. The only downside is a tiny bit of legal costs.
Courts should be able to issue sanctions/extra damages for the use of such tactics. If using such a tactic turned the claim from &quot;you killed this person negligently&quot; to &quot;you killed this person negligently, then willfully tried sleazy tricks to create additional suffering for the husband&quot;, and had the potential to double the award, companies would be much less eager to play this game.</span>

The terms do require Disney+ users to &quot;agree to resolve, by binding individual arbitration as provided below, all Disputes&quot; with some IP exceptions.
But &quot;Disputes&quot; is a term of art that &quot;includes any claim, dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or common law, between you and Disney concerning the Disney Products or this Agreement&quot; (emphasis added).
What are the Disney Products? They are &quot;certain websites, software, applications, content, products, and services in any media format or channel.&quot;
I hope the lawyers get sanctioned and disbarred.</span>

 Comrades of the &#x27;Weal, 
 I am very glad to see that you had so successful a meeting on the 11th. We had a very good one at Sheffield too though the attendance was small, it was very heartily enthusiastic, and our speakers were well received. 
 It will probably be news for you that I have left Sheffield for Liverpool, where I hope to be able to settle down. The fact is, our paper dragged on but badly, we could never pay more than about the half of the cost, and we determined to stop it at least …</span>

Comrade Creaghe is doing some more practical propaganda, by refusing to pay poor rates. He has taken the opportunity to explain his views on the subject, in the Sheffield Independent. His letter is so good and interesting that we reprint the whole of it:
 To the Editor - I have been summoned to the Town Hall, to show cause why I have not paid and refuse to pay poor rate levied on me. My answer is in the first place that I do not wish to do anything that …</span>

As our readers may be interested in Comrade Creaghe&#x27;s &quot;trial for libel&quot; at Sheffield, we quote his plucky speech in the police court, which we have taken from the report of the Sheffield Evening Telegraph and Star:
 Our Comrade said: “I wish to make a statement about the matter and leave it for you to decide whether you wish to dismiss it here. I think it was absurd that a number of people should have to come together and have to oc…</span>

For decades now, the international media, of almost all political persuasions, has either ignored the often historic events taking place in Catalonia, or presented them in a way that would not displease Madrid&#x27;s rulers, of all persuasions, including the nostalgics of Franco.

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

                              <span>The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, where short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates, and active management of the reserve supply is not required. In yesterday’s post, we proposed a methodology to evaluate the ampleness of reserves in real time based on the slope of the reserve demand curve—the elasticity of the federal (fed) funds rate to reserve shocks. In this post, we propose a suite of complementary indicators of reserve ampleness that, jointly with our elasticity measure, can help policymakers ensure that reserves remain ample as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet.</span>

The debunk videos are his major stock in trade, but I personally love (and discovered him through) the explainers about frame rate and shutter speed, color spaces, interlacing, and other details of the video art.
And of course, his mindbogglingly detailed exploration of Flight of the Navigator -- if you&#x27;ve seen the film, make some time tonight and watch it.</span>

                              <span>The controversy is that we get 2 different numbers depending on which method (cosmic microwave background vs cosmic distance ladder) we use to calculate the present rate of expansion. These numbers used to have their error bars overlapping, so we assumed they would eventually converge to the true value. But as we get more data the opposite is happening: the numbers are diverging and their error bars are shrinking such that they no longer overlap.
This tells us that either our model of the universe is wrong (therefore the cosmic microwave background method is giving us an incorrect answer) or that something is wrong with how we&#x27;re calculating the distances along the cosmic distance ladder. The latter was originally the assumption that should be proven true with more and better data from newer telescopes. This is now turning out not to be the case: our cosmic distance ladder calculations seem to have been very good, so it now seems more likely that our model of the universe is wrong.</span>

- Western Industry.
- The blue-collar middle class
- The Middle Class
- Our health care system
- Our education
- Western Economic Leadership.
- Social Mobility
Now they are busy destroying western technology, science and innovation on their never-ending selfish wealth-extraction quest.
They convinced us that our homes are investments, so they can fleece us with their usurary schemes. So, what next? our organs?
They convinced us to exchange our pensions for the privilege of being the mark on a market where the sharks like them do whatever the fuck they want, from blatant insider trading, to pump and dump schemes, to outright fraud, having for all practical purposes bought the SEC a long time ago.
What they will kill next?
How long are we going to transfer wealth to those slimmy sweet talking ignorant greedy bean counters?
Our daily work is like being in a mad house because almost everything is subordinated to the the most sacred goal of cooking the next quarter numbers to ensure we maximize executive bonuses, and fuck the long run! crazy projects started, spin offs, merges, projects cancelled, company killing layoffs, fuck long term value generation! they want more and more, and more, and they fucking want it right now! the fucking bonus gollums.
Everything is fucked in our society but executive compensation. Xerox, HP, IBM, Boeing... How many other proud symbols of our economy and civilization are we going to let them destroy?</span>

                              <span>As Kubernetes continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of
container orchestration, the community has decided to move cgroup v1 support
into maintenance mode in v1.31.
This shift aligns with the broader industry&#x27;s move towards cgroup v2, offering
improved functionalities: including scalability and a more consistent interface.
Before we dive into the consequences for Kubernetes, let&#x27;s take a step back to
understand what cgroups are and their significance in Linux.
Understanding cgroups
Control groups, or
cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation, prioritization,
denial, and management of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O,
and network bandwidth) among processes. This functionality is crucial for
maintaining system performance and ensuring that…</span>

                              <span>Announcing the graduation to General Availability (GA) of the PersistentVolume lastTransitionTime status
field, in Kubernetes v1.31!
The Kubernetes SIG Storage team is excited to announce that the &quot;PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime&quot; feature, introduced
as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.28, has now reached GA status and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release. This enhancement
helps Kubernetes users understand when a PersistentVolume transitions between
different phases, allowing for more efficient and informed resource management.
For a v1.31 cluster, you can now assume that every PersistentVolume object has a
.status.lastTransitionTime field, that holds a timestamp of
when the volume last transitioned its phase. This change is not immediate; the new field will be populated whenever a PersistentVolume
is updated and first transitions between phases (Pending, Bound, or Released) after upgrading to Kubernetes v1.31.
What changed?
The API strategy for updating PersistentVolume objects has been modified to populate the .status.lastTransitionTime field with the
current timestamp whenever a PersistentVolume transitions phases. Users are allowed to set this field manually if needed, but it will
be overwritten when the PersistentVolume transitions phases again.
For more details, read about
Phase transition timestamp in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing the feature as alpha in v1.28.

                              <span>When I set up my blog, I hoped that it would give me a motivation boost to write more. I hoped that putting my writing out to the public, and maybe having someone accidentally read one of my posts, would encourage me.
I will admit, I visit the analytics page of my blog at least once a day. Maybe it&#x27;s not the healthiest thing to do, but I do it. I do it because knowing that someone is reading my new post excites me. It makes me feel that there is a point to writing a blog instead of writing to my hard-disk.
I try to make writing a habit, but a huge part of it is you who are reading it. The sense of community is what makes my writing habit the strongest.</span>

                              <span>As an indie blogger, our unique voice is our biggest asset. Blogging challenges, especially those requiring daily posts, often lead to low-quality content.
I prefer reading spontaneous posts that are authentic, not those written solely to meet a daily challenge goal. As a reader, I can easily tell the difference.
Write when you have something genuine to share, rather than forcing content to meet a challenge deadline. Just my opinion!</span>

                              <span>At least, that’s what I keep telling myself.
Or maybe something along the lines of: Life is too short to force yourself to finish a book you don’t even like.
I’m being a bit dramatic, but the sentiment remains the same. I’ve been in such a reading slump this summer and it&#x27;s taking me forever to finish my current book. I’ve been struggling with finishing Daughter of Fire by Sofia Robleda for my Book club book, and thought it was just me. Our book club met yesterday and it was such a relief to hear that the others struggled as much as me. The only difference is… they finished, and I didn’t. I don’t typically have issues with historical fiction books, but this one is a struggle.
My current predicament: Do I continue reading it or do I start on our next book club pick?
I hate starting things, and not finishing them. I am only 77% through the book so I still have about a quarter of it left (1h10m). My heart is not into this book, the book club discussion already happened (and I was still able to participate)… so is there still a reason to finish it?
My list of Did Not Finish books is growing and it’s making me antsy. Outside of this book, I have the following shelved to one day finish (or maybe not)…
Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert
The Housemaid’s Secret by Freida McFadden
One in a Millennial by Kate Kennedy (audiobook)
Interior Chinatown by Charles Yu
I’m trying to feel less guilty about these unfinished books. There are so many great books out there to spend my time on, and I shouldn’t feel bad putting away a book because I’m not enjoying it.
I just need to convince myself a little harder.

(No really, I was a professional writer before the Internet mocked writing as “anybody could write”). I wrote in the real world. Blogging, yes I admit, was fun-writing. A soul release. I got paid to promote product and service by writing, and not by placing actual or visual ad on my website/blog. I felt disgusted eventually. I felt like a literary prostitute.I sold by the number of words. Eww! Eek!
I lost interest in writing, both professionally and leisurely. I started travelling. It took up a new watersport called skimboarding. I wrote again. I wrote about skimboarding. I wrote about skimboarding season. I wrote about anything skimboarding. I even made a brand fo…</span>

                              <span>The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby short-term interest rates are controlled mainly through the setting of administered rates. To do so, the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in the policy rate, the so-called federal funds rate. As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet following the plan laid out by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2022, how can it assess when to stop so that the supply of reserves remains ample? In the first post of a two-part series, based on the methodology developed in our recent Staff Report, we propose to assess the ampleness of reserves in real time by estimating the slope of the reserve demand curve.</span>

The following is a preliminary draft of the preface to the Turkish edition of my book Post-Anarchism and Psychoanalysis, which will be published in a few months.
 This book is the result of spoken improvisations that occurred during a strange period of wandering. I was removed from my position as Professor and Chair of Sociology at a major Russian university due in part to a renewed military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The consequent wandering extended also to the streets of Tomsk, Sochi, Nur Sultan, Vienna, and Budapest, before arriving for a prolonged residential retreat in Cork, Ireland, under a temporary protection order from the Europe…</span>

                              <span>Today is my fourth day in the office this month. My roommate J also goes to the office on Mondays, so when I sleep in we sometimes find ourselves getting ready at the same time, taking turns in the bathroom while flitting around brushing teeth, buttoning shirts, buckling belts, lacing boots.
Every once in a while when we do this we&#x27;ll smile and then laugh. Here we are, friends that first met in science class as scrawny kids someteen years ago, now roommates getting dressed for important-looking jobs we both know are pointless. At first we laugh because it&#x27;s funny seeing each other in collars and slacks, and then we laugh at the absurdity of it all. What else can you really do, if you think about it? 8 AM Monday morning is no time to peer into the abyss.

                              <span>Some people reminisce about their exes when they hear sad, wistful songs. I reminisce about who I used to be (in a gifted kid burnout way, not a narcissistic way). The ghost of Valentine past, if you will.
I&#x27;m listening to NIKI&#x27;s new album Buzz while working on my planned projects for one of my college organizations. It&#x27;s taking me right back to high school, when I was stepping into my very first &quot;real&quot; leadership position in an executive committee.
Isn&#x27;t it funny how things that were so serious to you get so much less so over time? I remember tripping over my words that day, feeling the heat crawl up my neck and ears when it was my turn to speak. Little fifteen-year-old me, surrounded by older girls I looked up to. I wanted so badly to impress them. When our director messaged me after the meeting to tell me I did great, I sagged with relief.
Now that I&#x27;m older than she was back then, I see how I must&#x27;ve looked to her: just a girl trying so hard to seem like she had it all under control. She must&#x27;ve known how important her encouragement was to me.
I loved what I did there. I stayed until I graduated high school. But when I started college, I wanted to leave it all behind me. I was tired and burned out, and it didn&#x27;t seem like it having extracurriculars would help. Whether it was good instinct or a self-fulfilling prophecy, I was right. I changed in a bad way. I messed up everything I touched.
I&#x27;ve come a long way now from my disastrous freshman year. I&#x27;ve pulled up my grades. I&#x27;ve made a few good friends. My extracurriculars are starting to look up again—the entire catalyst of this post was the project presentation I was putting together. But I can&#x27;t help it. I still miss who I used to be before all this, even though I know it&#x27;s just my memories polishing themselves brighter than they really were. Nostalgia really is one hell of a drug.</span>

It&#x27;s not just the ads and all the tracking being shoved up your computer&#x27;s ass that piss me off, but the molds people have willingly shoved themselves into. I&#x27;ve missed people having space to just experiment with their own existence online. People are so, so polished and trying their hardest to sell themselves.

Per the report, unsatisfactory welding performed on a set of fuel tanks led directly to a seven-month delay in EUS completion.
&gt; “According to NASA officials, the welding issues arose due to Boeing’s inexperienced technicians and inadequate work order planning and supervision,” the OIG says. [...]
Welders are highly qualified and well-paid craftsmen. Wouldn’t surprise me if they’d been hit particularly hard by management that doesn’t value tenured, expensive employees.</span>

After about 50 feet, he demanded our ID, informed us we were on private property, and threatened to have us arrested for trespassing, all in the same sentence. The issue was that my colleague was one of the amateur radio VE for the ham radio village and happened to have his handheld with him. The guard was aggressive, entitled, and arrogant.
Yesterday, I poked another friend to see where they were at the conference. They were not at the conference. They were stuck at resorts world three hours after the conference had started. Their conference badges had been confiscated by security. The security team had tried to force them to throw them in the garbage, and for a while it appeared that security had thrown …</span>

This means that the evidence they obtained will not be suppressed in this case.
That the guy&#x27;s case gets a right affirmed yet in his individual case it won&#x27;t make a difference has to be a pretty bitter pill to swallow.</span>

                              <span>Another point that Patreon isn&#x27;t really emphasizing here that seems relevant to any conversations about &quot;fairness&quot; is that Apple&#x27;s fees on Patreon subscriptions in-app are now higher than Patreon&#x27;s fees.
It&#x27;s important to recognize any time that we&#x27;re talking about the market that services charge what they can, not what is fair. The market does not have a concept of fairness, only competition. This is why there is no such thing as a benevolent monopoly that charges fair prices - because fairness does not exist in the market, only competition.
BUT... since fairness gets so often brought into conversations about Apple&#x27;s fees, often with the implicit suggestion that Apple &quot;deserves&quot; to be compensated for all of the work they&#x27;re putting into hosting and curating apps and for (in heavy quotes) &quot;creating&quot; a market that they supposedly also don&#x27;t have duopoly control over: does anybody want to argue that Apple hosting the Patreon app on iOS provides more value to Patreon subscribers and creators than the existence of Patreon itself does?
Like, if we&#x27;re going to talk about what&#x27;s egregious and what&#x27;s not egregious, charging higher fees per-transaction than the platforms you are hosting seems like it might be a good indicator that things have gotten out of control.</span>

                              <span>Shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023, a consortium of eleven large U.S. financial institutions deposited $30 billion into First Republic Bank to bolster its liquidity and assuage panic among uninsured depositors. In the end, however, First Republic Bank did not survive, raising the question of whether a reallocation of liquidity among financial institutions can ever reduce the need for central bank balance sheet expansion in the fight against bank runs. We explore this question in this post, based on a recent working paper.</span>

Sketching Fortress-Europe
 Fortress-Europe means: strict guarding the sea and land borders of an imaginary, unified, “clean” European territory from the Others, the non-Europeans, those who live outside the fortress of supposed well-being. Fortress-Europe is the Dublin 2 law which forces immigrants to stay in their first country of arrival, trapping them there, destining them for deportation or an illegal journey. Fortress-Europe is the construction of visible (from the mines at Evros to Frontex) and invisible walls (see legal difficulties, minimal rights etc) that end up in deaths or deportations.

                              <span>Kubernetes components use on-off switches called feature gates to manage the risk of adding a new feature.
The feature gate mechanism is what enables incremental graduation of a feature through the stages Alpha, Beta, and GA.
Kubernetes components, such as kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler, use the client-go library to interact with the API.
The same library is used across the Kubernetes ecosystem to build controllers, tools, webhooks, and more. client-go now includes
its own feature gating mechanism, giving developers and cluster administrators more control over how they adopt client features.

In the absence of client-go feature gates, each new feature separated feature availability from enablement i…</span>

Nevertheless, given the social and economic orientation of the new Prime Minister, Muhammad Yunus, we can only fear that the neo-liberal capitalist extractivist export model will continue and that the debt system will also continue.

                              <span>During the weekend, I sat and fiddled with a new theme for Bear blog.
I&#x27;m not a professional designer and have no ambition to become one. I just think it&#x27;s very fun and interesting to tinker with. Time slips away in an almost meditative state as small snippets of text magically transform the canvas.
Regardless of what we like or do for work, I think it&#x27;s extremely important to have personal interests. Unfortunately, these are often the first things to go when we&#x27;re struggling.
I&#x27;ve been in the darkest of places myself. One by one, I abandoned my interests. Not because I&#x27;d lost interest, but because I thought it would fix what was broken.
A fruitless attempt, of course, to try to fix the inside by messing with the outside. A downward spiral that accelerated into the bottomless depths with each interest I let go. In the end, they were all gone – and I felt worse than ever.
Fortunately, I got the help I needed. Slowly but surely, I began to climb out of the grave I&#x27;d dug for myself. As time passed, I started to reintroduce my interests, slowly and cautiously: designing, photography, movies…
It wasn’t a quick fix, that’s for sure, and not the only change I had to make. But things were heading in the right direction.
Now I feel better than in a long, long time –although it’s still like being on a crab fishing boat on the Bering Sea, not knowing when the next storm will hit.
If it weren&#x27;t for rediscovering my love of my interests and letting them illuminate my life, I&#x27;d still be lost in the dark. My interests are lighthouses on the rough sea of life.</span>

I came to this thought the more posts I write. The fact that I&#x27;m writing for my own enjoyment rather than to show anyone makes it so rewarding and satisfying because I don&#x27;t have to deal with any pressures or expectations from others. It&#x27;s not some technical documentation that has to be comprehensible or an academic thesis that needs to be written to the highest degree. It&#x27;s my blog, and I can write whatever I want. It&#x27;s so freeing to just let my mind flow across the page and have my consciousness translated into intelligible language.
I write to write, whether it&#x27;s about a topic I&#x27;m interested in or a post or quote that I found cool and wanted to share. All my writings are simply words on a page that have originated from my imagination. Writing is…</span>
