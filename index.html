Let’s start at the beginning.
I’ve been writing for most of my life. As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way.

                              <span>Since Robert Birming released his Timeline design, I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and including it in some of my pages.
But I was also curious on how I could include it to make a microblog out of a typical Bearblog. Not that you can&#x27;t make short posts on here in a default look, but most of the design of Bearblog and its themes is decidedly for longform content. I wanted something that looks more like a microblogging/short post platform.
&#x3D;&#x3D;Some goals I had in mind for my own microblog:&#x3D;&#x3D;
I didn&#x27;t want these low effort posts to be in the Discovery section; make_discoverable has to be false in the Post preset.
The posts need to mention when they were made; I need to include {{ post_published_date }} in the h4 of the Timeline code.
I want the main page you land on to display the most recent …</span>

                              <span>When I was a child, I grew up in a hoarder home. My mother had me at 16. We lived with my grandmother and her then wife, who kept everything she ever received. I have vivid memories of two things in that house.
The first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.
 

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.
 

When I was 11, my mother …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lived in neighborhoods with a Homeowners Association1 all my life. There were times I found having one to be advantageous, but these days it&#x27;s just plain annoying.
The house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

                              <span>Disclaimer: I wrote this article before OpenAI released o1, which now hides its &quot;reasoning&quot; tokens making them inaccessible through the tiktoken library. I think o1 uses the same base tokenizer as GPT-o, but unfortunately we can no longer observe this directly.
GPT-o introduces a new tokenizer o200k_base, which both doubles the model&#x27;s vocabulary size to 200k (previously 100k with GPT-4) and significantly improves token compression, especially for non-English tokens.

Source: GPT-o release
Compression
For non-Latin scripts, o200k_base achieves significantly higher token compression compared to GPT-4&#x27;s c100k_base, demonstrating more efficient word tokenization.
For example, looking at the Tamil sentence நீ எப்படி இருக்கிறாய்? நான் நல்லா இருக்கேன். (translation: How are you? I am fine.), c10…</span>

Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

Thankfully, my sneakers were worn and in need of replacing so getting them soaked wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal; still, one is forced to ask oneself if they&#x27;re capable of making good life decisions when the wind starts howling against your umbrella. By the time I got to the halfway point of my walk, lightning was flashing furiously. Like I said, not a good life decision.

                              <span>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.

In supplemental questions to the February 2024 Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), we asked a representative sample of U.S. residents about their experience with genAI tools.

I&#x27;ve been writing on the internet for most of the time that I&#x27;ve been alive. I&#x27;ve done it on blogs, I&#x27;ve done it on social media. I&#x27;ve done it for money and I&#x27;ve done it for free. I&#x27;ve done it on Tumblr and on more than one defunct media vertical and in interactive fiction.
Cohost was the first place where it felt like, consistently, someone was always reading. Something about the site&#x27;s design and user culture created a magical space where people approached things with openness and curiosity and willingness to give their time and attention.
This felt like a place where you could write about anything and people would care. I&#x27;ve talked about the Put your Helmet…</span>

it really is precious, sometimes. to look at something and be able to experience it with your senses. it&#x27;s novel, most days. you just do it without thinking.
but then there&#x27;s times when you experience an intangible unreality so strong that it becomes a force in your life that can&#x27;t be measured. we don&#x27;t have scales for that, or weights that add up the unreal intangible space that exists between little lights in a grid &amp; your brain.
there is a space, somewhere within the imagination, that fills in bit by bit over time. like reading a book, making the world come to life, hearing voices, making up the parts that the author never tells you. internet spa…</span>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus. Also known as, at this time, the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force. Where she became an air traffic controller, as it is also known, air is notoriously difficult to control at any given time of the day or night.</span>

Do you want to present your blogging timeline in a stylish way? Or perhaps have a unique style for your micro thoughts? Or keep a changelog for documenting your blog’s development?
Say hello to the latest cub in the Bearming theme family: Timeline.
Here’s an example with the time-focused timeless song In the Year 2525 (further down the page, you’ll find instructions on how to implement it on your blog):
Year 3535
In the year 3535, ain&#x27;t gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie, everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.
Year 5555
In the year 5555, your arms hangin&#x27; limp at your sides, your legs got nothin&#x27; to do, some machine&#x27;s doin&#x27; that for you.

                              <span>Expectations can play a significant role in driving economic outcomes, with central banks factoring market sentiment into policy decisions and market participants forming their own assumptions about monetary policy. But how well do central banks understand the expectations of market participants—and vice versa? Our model, developed in a recent paper, features a dynamic game between (i) a monetary authority that cannot commit to an inflation target and (ii) a set of market participants that understand the incentives created by that credibility problem. In this post, we describe the game, a type of Keynesian beauty contest: its main novelty is that each side attempts, with varying degrees of accuracy, to forecast the other’s beliefs, resulting in new findings regarding the levels and trajectories of inflation.</span>

In this interview, Sandeep Kanabar, a deaf member of the DHHWG and part of the Kubernetes SIG ContribEx Communications team, sits down with Catherine to explore the impact of the DHHWG on cloud native projects like Kubernetes.
Sandeep’s journey is a testament to the power of inclusion.

a classic. delicious Y2K Teal. iconic. gotta love her. 4.5/5.
blueberry

barely distinguishable from the original Bondi Blue, but from what i can tell in photos online and in real life, it&#x27;s a slightly lighter color compared to bondi blue. but because of that, i think it&#x27;s missing some contrast. i don&#x27;t like it as much. 3/5
grape

underappreciated one! this color combination makes me think of the Teenz Zone at my library circa 2000. 4/5
tangerine

truthfully, my fondness for this one is 99% because of The Cheat&#x27;s computer. but it&#x27;s a fun, retrofuturistic color choice, especially with the form factor. on its own i give it a 4.5/5, but it gets elevated to 5/5 because it makes me think of Homestar.

                              <span>In a world of endless notifications, feature-bloated apps, and constant digital noise, I found myself yearning for simplicity. That&#x27;s why I created Nihil - a suite of minimalist tools designed to help you focus on what truly matters.
The Vision Behind Nihil
Nihil was born out of a personal need. As a developer and a user, I was frustrated with the complexity of many digital tools. I wanted something that would strip away the unnecessary and leave only the essential. Something that would help me think clearer and live more intentionally.
That&#x27;s the core of Nihil&#x27;s philosophy: less is more. Each tool in the Nihil suite serves a single, specific purpose. No bloat, no distractions - just pure functionality.

What Makes Nihil Different?
Purposeful Design
Every feature in Nihil is there because …</span>
