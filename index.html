                              <span>For a good part of my life, I tried to be religious and failed miserably. During my formative years, church was a social connection as well as a place for religious instruction. During elementary school, my Mom was married to a non-believer, so she didn&#x27;t attend church, but my siblings and I went with a neighbor to a Southern Baptist church on the outskirts near the prison. My brother and I were active in the boys’ youth group, called RAs for Royal Adventurers. In the summer, we went to VBS (Vacation Bible School).
In high school, I lived with my aunt and uncle. They went to a Presbyterian Church, one of many in the area, reflecting the Scottish heritage in the part of North Carolina where we lived. One of my favorite parts of each week was the Sunday evening Youth Fellowship meetings. It …</span>

                              <span>I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.
I cannot stand the fake positivity and cute-sounding arguments for returning to the office. It falls flat for so many and it’s trying to make it sound more legitimate by evoking this image of collaboration, being social, kindness, having a good time together when that’s not the point. The point is micromanagement and needing to justify the large office spaces they invested into. Very rarely are there positions or departments who truly need to collab in person, and then they can just do that for the occasion, not a fixed amount of days per week or month where they need to go in at all times.
It’s a joke. At my place, we don’t innovate, we don’t develop new products …</span>

                              <span>The National People&#x27;s Power (NPP) has made history. With its unprecedented, record-breaking electoral victory at the general election of 2024, the NPP has succeeded in engineering popular dissent towards comprehensive regime change. Its parliamentary super majority has been secured on the back of a near complete rout of the political establishment, while seemingly transcending the ethnic majoritarianism manifested by governments in the past to obtain electoral victories. Most significantly, (...)

In a previous post, we established three facts about failing banks that indicated that failing banks experience deteriorating fundamentals many years ahead of their failure and across a broad range of institutional settings. In this post, we document that bank failures are remarkably predictable based on simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements that measure a bank’s insolvency risk and funding vulnerabilities.</span>

We think of the family as a group that practices “basic communism”: from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. Any family is thought to be protected by bonds of kinship from the cruel laws of the outside world. Unlike businesses, rarely will a family throw out a sick child or an elderly parent because they are no longer “revenue-generating assets.” More

We do not recognize Putin’s view of NATO as a beast with encircling claws. At the same time, Russians can be forgiven for thinking that the Western narrative is not quite as defensive as it seems. “The spread of our values makes us safer” declared Tony Blair in Chicago in 1999, justifying NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia. This sets out the ground for forcible regime change when the opportunity offers. The underlying message is that democracy is the peaceful, dictatorship the warlike form of the state, so a war for democracy is necessarily a war for peace. Many Western analysts view the war in Ukraine as a war for regime change in Russia, which is why they cannot contemplate anything less than a Ukrainian victory. More

Ever since, overt manipulation of the reality of the West Papuan people has been the order of the day in the international arena.

                              <span>When it comes to building habits to enjoy reading, I’ve experimented with quite a few ideas. Some worked while others didn’t. The four strategies that follow have proven themselves, making and keeping reading enjoyable.
Here’s hoping they work just as well for you.
Quit Annoying Books (but not immediately)
Are you reading a book and still finding it just average after a hundred pages? Quit it. Put it away and move on. There are too many incredible books waiting to be read to waste time on ones you don’t enjoy. If there’s one thing that can destroy your joy of reading, it’s forcing yourself to read through books you don&#x27;t like. Think back to the books you were forced to read in school. For most of us, those didn’t exactly ignited our love for reading, did they?

ICC and the prosecutor are on very solid ground here.
The prosecutor asked opinions from a impartial panel of experts in international law. The panel included people like Theodor Meron (former Legal adviser for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs),  Helene Kennedy, Adrian Fulford.

                              <span>This is a great step in the right direction. I can&#x27;t speak directly for MIT, but there are issues with how these programs don&#x27;t apply to parents with small family businesses. My parents had a small business, with my father taking home a salary of $XX,XXX. Duke University used the business assets to determine the EFC (expected family contribution) of literally 90% of the salary. Essentially saying to sell off the family business for the college fund, which was a non-starter.
Small businesses are allegedly the backbone of America, and I feel these tuition support programs overlook this segment of the middle-class.</span>

                              <span>October 2023 there was similar incident where Chinese cargo ship cut Balticonnector cable and  EE-S1 cable. Chip named &#x27;Newnew Polar Bear&#x27; under Chinese flag and Chinese company Hainan Xin Xin Yang Shipping Co, Ltd. (aka Torgmoll) with CEO named Yelena V. Maksimova, drags anchor in the seabed cutting cables. Chinese investigation claims storm was the reason, but there was no storm, just normal windy autumn weather. The ship just lowered one anchor and dragged it with engines running long time across the seabed until the anchor broke.
These things happen sometimes, ship anchors sometimes damage cables, but not this often and without serious problems in the ship. Russians are attempting plausible deniability.</span>

                              <span>Something that comes up sometimes in programming languages is the difference between nominal and structural type systems.
nearly every programming language gets wrong.
But let&#x27;s start from the top
What&#x27;s In a Name
If you&#x27;re coming from a language like Java, Kotlin, Haskell, OCaml or Rust (or most other languages really), nominal types are what you would probably just think of as &quot;types&quot;.
In a language like this, a type needs to be defined in a type declaration where it is given a name that acts as its sole source of identity, without any regard for its implementation. Even if two separate types happen to share the same implementation, they are deemed unequal because they have different names.
For example, if I were to define two java classes
class A {
    int x;
}
class B {
    int x;
}

                              <span>Introduction
Continuation of the snake game series. This one is using C + Raylib and there will be another version with Zig + Raylib. You might wonder why did I wrote multiple versions of this snake games? My gamedev session is usually done in Godot 4, but I have always been curious how it differs when doing gamedev in Raylib.
What&#x27;s Raylib?

Taken from the website: a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no gui tools or editors... just coding in pure spartan-programmers way.
Key point: &quot;pure spartan-programmers way&quot;.
Yes compared to using Godot 4, I do feel like a Spartan warrior when using Raylib! Gamedev in Godot is a walk in the park comparatively.
NOTE: you&#x27;ll see a super similar code compared to the ASCII snake code.

My Dad woke up this morning and didn&#x27;t know what day it was. Panicked, he sent a text message to almost everyone in the family asking for help. At this point, that means my siblings and his. We are a close family and several of us sprang into action. His brother-in-law lives a couple of miles away and was the first to arrive. My aunt, a nurse with more than 40 years experience was there within the hour. They got him to the doctor and then the hospital where the doctors are running tests to rule out a stroke. His thinking seems to have cleared up since he sent the original text but he still couldn&#x27;t figure out how to set an alarm on his phone. That kind of thing is starting to happen with more frequency.

It&#x27;s everywhere right now - Bearblog, the news, other online spaces talking about the great eXodus. It ranged from singing praises to it just being the new thing or &quot;at least it&#x27;s not X&quot;. I have to say, some things about it are really enticing and cool; aside from it being a new shiny thing to try out, I love the idea of the starter packs, the import tools, the custom domains (and those also serving as a kind of verification system), algorithmic feeds, thread and feed preferences, labeling and more.
But what keeps me critical is wondering if we aren&#x27;t just repeating the cycle?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone through times when management would treat estimates as deadlines, and were deaf to any sort of reason about why it could be otherwise, like the usual thing of them changing the specification repeatedly.
So when those times have occurred I&#x27;ve (we&#x27;ve more accurately) adopted what I refer to the &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; response to just about anything non-trivial.  &quot;Hoo boy, that could be doozy.  I think someone on the team needs to take an hour or so and figure out what this is really going to take.&quot;  Then you&#x27;ll get asked to &quot;ballpark it&quot; because that&#x27;s what managers do, and they get a number that makes them rise up in their chair, and yes, that is the number they remember.  And then you do your hour of due diligence, and try your best not to actually give any other number than the ballpark at any time, and then you get it done &quot;ahead of time&quot; and look good.
Now, I&#x27;ve had good managers who totally didn&#x27;t need this strategy, and I loved &#x27;em to death.  But for the other numbnuts who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn their career skills, they get the whites of my eyes.
Also, just made meetings a lot more fun.</span>

Low RPM tosses: Most of the recordings are on crapy webcams with ~ 30FPS. The coin spin usually much faster than the sensor can record which results in often non-spinning-looking flips. Why did we take the videos in the first place? To check that everyone collected the data and to audit the results.
Building a flipping matching: The study is concerned with human coin flips. Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery&#x27;s (DHM, 2007) paper theorize that the imperfection of human flips causes the same-side bias. Building a machine completely defeats the purpose of the experiment.

It shows how the Coca-Cola Company turned to &quot;science&quot; when the company was beset by the obesity crisis of the 1990s and health advocates were calling for, among other things, soda taxes.
Coca-Cola &quot;mobilized allies in academia to create a soda-defense science that would protect profits by advocating exercise, not dietary restraint, as the priority solution to obesity.&quot; It was a successful campaign and did particularly well in the Far East. &quot;In China, this distorted science has left its mark not just on national obesity policies but on the apparatus for managing chronic disease generally.&quot;
Point being, the science that Coca-Cola propagated is entirely legitimate. But that science itself does not tell the whole, obvious truth, which is that there is certainly a correlation in a society between obesity rates and overall sugar-soda consumption rates. &quot;Coke’s research isn’t fake science, Greenhalgh argues; it was real science, conducted by real and eminent scientists, but distorted by its aim.&quot;
&quot;Trust the science&quot; can thus be a dangerous call to arms. Here&#x27;s the book, if anybody&#x27;s interested. https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo221451...</span>

                              <span>People here seem to be underestimating the advantages that Google gets just because of Chrome:
- When you sign in to Google, you sign in browser-wide. Google now gets all of your browsing data, perfect for advertising. (If you ever doubt it, go check out Google Takeout. You&#x27;ll be shocked at the amount of data you see there.)
- They have special APIs and features that they get to use, and nobody else. Only because they own Chrome. [1]
- They get to move forward with enabling and pushing features that allow for more advertising: see Manifest v3, FLoC.
- Google specifically serves a worse version of Search on Firefox for Mobile. You have to get an extension to get the full experience.
This isn&#x27;t an isolated attempt. You can see more of the same thing with Android.
- AOSP (the open source counterpart of Android) is now unusable. It doesn&#x27;t ship with most essential apps, including a Phone app. In previous versions of Android, all of these were a part of AOSP.
- Most third party launchers/stores struggle to implement features because they are only available for Google themselves.
- The signing in with Google thing from above continues here too: you sign in to Google system-wide.

                              <span>This is a misleading framing. The two cables last year were not taken out by an anchor as an accident, it was literally a ship putting down its anchor just before the cable and then dragging it over the cable. In other words, sabotage. There&#x27;s no point in trying to color any of this with rose tinted glasses when it&#x27;s clear who&#x27;s done it and why.</span>

In most universities here in New Zealand, articles have to be published in a journal indexed by Elsevier&#x27;s Scopus. Not in a Scopus-indexed journal, it does not count anymore than a reddit comment. This gives Elsevier tremendous power. But in CS/ML/AI most academics and students turn to Google Scholar first when doing searches.</span>

I think you’d be hard pressed to find any well-known actor of recent decades who did not work with them. My favourite is A Room with a View, which I’ve written […]</span>

Let´s define ´normal´ inflation as anything between 0 and 1% per month and anything between 1 and 50% per month as superinflation (1% a month is still a lot, yearly!).

                              <span>I feel like the peak internet for me was some time around 2004. The internet felt balanced, and I was happy with my relationship with it. Sure, I probably spent more time than I should have on the internet, but at least I wasn&#x27;t carrying it around with me. I wasn&#x27;t surfing the web on my bathroom breaks or while standing in line at the grocery store. The internet was a tool, not a conqueror of my attention.
For years, I&#x27;ve talked about wanting to set up a desktop or a designated computer space. Some place where I have go and sit down in order to log on. A place where I&#x27;ll keep my computer off and give myself a few seconds to decide whether looking up an actress in some random sitcom episode is truly worth the effort. I want to add a little friction to my computing and just see how my mental health responds. Will I feel better? Will my attention improve? These are the questions I&#x27;m curious about.
Being that I have a little free time on my hands, I thought now is as good of a time as ever to give this a shot. So, starting tonight at midnight, I&#x27;m disconnecting. For the next week, my MacBook will live on my dining room table. I&#x27;m uninstalling most of the apps that I use on my phone to make it as bare-bones as possible. My iPad will remain on, but with the Wi-Fi turned off. I have a lot of magazines downloaded courtesy of Archive.org and some books I plan to read with my free time.
I wonder how my browsing habits will change if I don&#x27;t have a piece of technology at my fingertips. Will I feel compelled to keep up with as much, or will I just find other mindless activities to fill my time? Heck, I even wonder if I&#x27;ll make it the whole week. But these are the questions I will hopefully have an answer to around this time next week. With that being said, if anyone needs to contact me e-mail is going to be your best bet, because I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll check that, but I&#x27;m probably going to miss a lot elsewhere.

whoa, i love your blog theme. super cute, sleek, while still very functional... i love it! definitely adding your blog to my rss feeds, i&#x27;ve liked your posts so far!
love the look of the blog.
I wanted to make it reminiscent to some elements from my art archive, but keep it pretty simple, both because Bear is pretty minimal by nature &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to let my perfectionist side take over.

                              <span>&gt; It&#x27;s better to have some wonky parameterization than it is to have multiple implementations of nearly the same thing. Improving the parameters will be easier than to consolidate four different implementations if this situation comes up again.
Hard disagree. If you cant decompose to avoid &quot;wonky parameters&quot; then keep them separate. Big smell is boolean flags (avoid altogether when you can) and more than one enum parameter.
IME &quot;heavy&quot; function signatures are always making things harder to maintain.</span>

And while I also love this I get the sense that many others here are maybe too young to remember that this kind of open access to data used to exist for lots websites. It inspired companion sites and loads of creativity. I find it tragic really, what the internet has become. I hope federated, and even more-so p2p, protocols take significant foothold on the internet and help revive this spirit of the web. The corpo-web is so fucking boring.</span>

She had said that Becca was a &quot;baby name,&quot; and that once she had turned six, she wanted to be called Rebecca. As Eric Meyer put it, &quot;She made it to six. For almost twelve hours, she was six. So Rebecca it is and must be.&quot;

I&#x27;ve got some small/tiny gamedev projects on my pocket that I haven&#x27;t documented here in my Bearblog account. The first one is an ASCII Snake game only using the curses library. There will be another similar post on making Snake game using Raylib.

                              <span>Every time a big company screws up, there are two highly informed sets of people who are guaranteed to be lurking, but rarely post, in a thread like this:
1) those directly involved with the incident, or employees of the same company.  They have too much to lose by circumventing the PR machine.
2) people at similar companies who operate similar systems with similar scale and risks.  Those people know how hard this is and aren’t likely to publicly flog someone doing their same job based on uninformed speculation. They know their own systems are Byzantine and don’t look like what random onlookers think it would look like.
So that leaves the rest, who offer insights based on how stuff works at a small scale, or better yet, pronouncements rooted in “first principles.”</span>
