                              <span>Because this opinion has surfaced a number of times here: Yes, Tolkien did care deeply about the realism of his world. And because he spent his whole life studying pre-modern societies, the societies he creates in Middle Earth do function very realistically. I think there are two reason why many readers miss this:
(1) Much of Tolkien&#x27;s world-building is implicit rather than explicit. He doesn&#x27;t talk about Aragorn&#x27;s tax policy because he doesn&#x27;t need to; Aragorn is recognisably a feudal king and there is a standard way taxes are done a feudal system (i.e. the vassals take care of gathering them). Tolkien has a deep understanding of how such societies function, but much of this comes out indirectly in the story, through the way the characters behave and what they can and cannot do.
(2) Pre-modern societies are so deeply different from modern ones (economically, culturally, and socially) that I think many readers stumble across things they find unexpected and dismiss it as &quot;unrealistic fantasy&quot;, without understanding that in such a context, this is exactly how one would expect the world to work. For example, the deep devotion and self-sacrificial service Sam shows to Frodo is often discussed in terms of friendship (and it is a great friendship), but one cannot fully understand it unless one also understands it as a (very positive) master-servant relationship.
If you want a better understanding of the deeper realism of LotR, I cannot recommend Bret Devereaux&#x27; blog highly enough. He is an ancient military historian and has written extensive (but entertaining!) analyses of both LotR and GoT. See here for two samples: https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helm..., https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-wa...</span>

                              <span>I understand the frustration, but at the end of the day I think they do serve a purpose. They&#x27;re not great at that purpose, but they&#x27;re good enough and they generally produce false negatives (smart people fail) rather than false positives (you hire an idiot). And this makes sense, because a false negative is low cost (maybe you spend 50% longer interviewing candidates) but a false positive is high cost (you hire an idiot and have to spend months establishing that, firing them and starting the hiring process again).
The side effect of this though, is that it&#x27;s an extremely painful process for the applicant. Even if you&#x27;re a great software engineer, you&#x27;re going to freeze up, miss something, have a bad day, and fail a few interviews. Now for most software engineers failure is an unusual and harrowing experience, so they react really badly to it. Especially ina 
 scenario where it&#x27;s difficult to blame anyone but yourself. But just don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s fine! just move on, there&#x27;s plenty of jobs and the interview process is a blunt tool, not a final evaluation of your worth in life.</span>

                              <span>Leetcode style interviews probably serve two functions:
1) A way to suppress wages and job mobility for SWE. Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.
2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear/similar objective.
Meet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…
Or is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.
To the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.
I’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree/number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.
Someone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree/number theory/inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.</span>

The best part was that instead of attacking the messenger and denying any problem, Cox seem to have acted like the very model of responsible security response in this kind of situation. I&#x27;d love to read a follow up on what the bug was that intermittently permitted unauthorised access to the APIs. It&#x27;s the kind of error that could easily be missed by superficial testing or depending on the reason behind the bug, perhaps not even experienced in the test environment.</span>

                              <span>My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.</span>

                              <span>Today is one of those days when I feel I have nothing to write.
Then I started thinking...
What is it that says you have to have something to write to start writing? It&#x27;s just an idea, an idea of how things work.
You have something to write.
You write it.
It doesn&#x27;t have to be like that. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.
There are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...
It should be sunny on Midsummer day (it&#x27;s a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).
When life doesn&#x27;t go the way it&#x27;s “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.
What if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things &quot;should be”? What if we face the day with a little &quot;let&#x27;s see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings&quot;?
It&#x27;s worth trying.

                              <span>This is a short story I wrote a while back :
It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…</span>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.</span>

                              <span>Many Americans are celebrating the news of Donald Trump’s conviction on 34 felony charges in a hush-money incident that took place ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Newspaper headlines screamed “TRUMP GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS” and media reports relied on superlatives such as “historic” and “unprecedented” to label the unanimous jury verdict. Given that Trump has been unusually adept at avoiding accountability for a staggering number of alleged crimes, the verdict felt like a long-overdue comeuppance. More

Hungary is slashing income tax for women with four or more children. Russia is offering women with 10 or more children a “Mother-Heroine” award. Greece, Italy, and South Korea are bribing women with attractive baby bonuses. China has instituted a three-child policy. Iran has outlawed free contraceptives and vasectomies. Japan has joined forces with the fertility industry to infiltrate schools to promote early childbearing. A leading UK demographer has proposed taxing the childless. Religious myths are preventing African men from getting vasectomies. A eugenics-inspired Natal conference just took place in the U.S., a nation leading the way in taking away reproductive rights.

                              <span>More than a desire to restore a supposed national glory, Trump’s quest to “make America great again” is the search for his own “authentic essence.” His narcissism is pathological. He displays pomposity, grandiosity, and superiority, constantly seeking attention. He expects perfect loyalty from others to affirm his own value. He chooses wives and lovers based solely on their looks to convince himself of his own, physical beauty. He belittles and bullies others to affirm himself. He plays the victim to make sure that any failure is the fault of others, since he is faultless. And he exhibits a profound sense of emptiness – his hours-long perorations at MAGA rallies are ways of filling the void in his spirit and soul. There, he mirrors the ideological stance of his most damaged and desperate working-class followers, and they do the same with him. More

During the extremely wet winter a year earlier, the great Tulare Lake had once again overflowed its dams, dikes, levees and ditches, as it does every once in a while despite all the efforts of government and agribusiness, and spread to its full size of 800 square miles just south of the Rancheria, The return of the lake brought new faith and determination to these extraordinary people, who have lived here since long before the coming of the Europeans whom they have barely managed to survive.

                              <span>Totally fair question! My reasons were:
1. To maximize Photon&#x27;s battery life I tried to make the hardware do the absolute minimum to record imagery. To that end, Photon stores images on an unformatted SD card (ie one huge linear array of bytes) which is easy and fast to index into.
2. A 16-bit MSP430 handles writing the image data, and the MSP430&#x27;s codespace is 99% exhausted without dealing with the complexities of a filesystem like FAT32, so adding support for a filesystem wouldn&#x27;t currently fit. (This line of MSP430, MSP430FR2433, has a maximum of 16 KB of FRAM, but perhaps I could use a different line.)
3. Photon stores images as RAW image data that require post-processing to view the images. Since I wanted to provide a polished app to view the imagery anyway, I figured I&#x27;d just make it a requirement.
I&#x27;m not saying those are all particularly good reasons, but that was my reasoning anyhow.</span>

                              <span>I think there’s one flaw in the overall theory presented in the article: it was demand for coal for heating independent of the industrial revolution that really kickstarted things and the labor exploited for coal mining was the lowest of the socioeconomic classes. Before the industrial revolution England was already mining around five times more coal than the rest of the world combined just to survive winters. Once they exhausted the easy surface deposits they had to go deeper and deeper which required mechanized power to work against the water seeping in. The first engines were invented not when labor became too expensive but when it was impossible to do with human labor at all.
After reading Coal - A Human History I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs and a surface supply of coal just big enough to get the industry started but not enough to supply the growing population without digging deeper.</span>

                              <span>Actually the limit predicted by Shannon can be significantly beaten, because Shannon assumes gaussian noise, but if we use photon counting receivers we need to use a  poisson distribution. This is the Gordon-Holevo limit.
To beat Shannon you need PPM formats and photon counters (single photon detectors).
One can do significantly better than the numbers from voyager in the article using optics even without photon cpunting. Our group has shown 1 photon/bit at 10 Gbit/s [1] but others have shown even higher sensitivity (albeit at much lower data rates).

                              <span>Wasn&#x27;t expecting my question to hit top of HN. I guess I&#x27;ll give some context for why I asked it.
I work in quantum error correction, and was trying to collect interesting and quantitative examples of repetition codes being used implicitly in classical systems. Stuff like DRAM storing a 0 or 1 via the presence or absence of 40K electrons [1], undersea cables sending X photons per bit (don&#x27;t know that one yet), some kind of number for a transistor switching (haven&#x27;t even decided on the number for that one yet), etc.
A key reason quantum computing is so hard is that by default repetition makes things worse instead of better, because every repetition is another chance for an unintended measurement. So protecting a qubit tends to require special physical properties, like the energy gap of a superconductor, or complex error correction strategies like surface codes. A surface code can easily use 1000 physical qubits to store 1 logical qubit [2], and I wanted to contrast that with the sizes of implicit repetition codes used in classical computing.

&gt; Unlike SerenityOS, Ladybird will have a relaxed NIH policy (instead of &quot;no 3rd party code!&quot;), and will leverage the greater OSS ecosystem.
SerenityOS wants to be an OS from scratch, to see how to do things better from existing implementations. When ladybird wants to target that OS as well, using 3rd party libraries would make it hard to stay compatible. Which is easier to do on just MacOS and Linux.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Ladybird now targets Linux and macOS. The SerenityOS target is dropped.
Why dropping the SerenityOS target??
Does this mean that SerenityOS&#x27;s Ladybird will need to continually pull patches from the new Ladybird project in order to keep development?
Also: is it really a fork if the new project gets to keep the name &quot;Ladybird&quot;? Will SerenityOS&#x27;s browser need to be renamed, or there will be two diverging Ladybird projects with the same name? (Maybe a qualifier would help, like SerenityOS Ladybird vs Open Ladybird or something?)</span>

                              <span>In 1993 I was interviewed for an operating job in a power plant for a major airline, assigned to their data center. At my current job, I was working in a high rise office building with sixty-six floors.
The operating system computer was a JC8520, which was running a version of MS-DOS. All commands had to be typed in correctly or nothing would happen. While operating the plant, several commands had to be entered every shift, since the owners didn&#x27;t purchase a very automated package.
In the interview for the data center job, I was asked if I had any experience with Windows. I didn&#x27;t understand the question because I wasn&#x27;t aware they were talking about a computer operating system! So, I replied at the office building I worked in there were outside contractors who cleaned the windows.
After my reply all seven of the interviewers were all grinning and I was aware I said something they weren&#x27;t looking for. One of the men politely told me Windows  was a computer operating system. My reply was, &quot;Oh, I see.&quot;
When I returned home I told my wife what happened and we shouldn&#x27;t get our hopes up. To my utter shock, a week later I was offered the job, which I took and after some training, learned something I didn&#x27;t know before.</span>

                              <span>I was a full-time mom and military wife when my kids were little. We moved into a 2 bedroom, 50 year old duplex at a new duty station and there was a low-ceiling basement that was mostly consumed by a giant boiler but there was one low-ceiling room down there and we made it a playroom because our two kids were sharing a really tiny bedroom.
So we set up a TV down there and it&#x27;s a rental so we don&#x27;t want to drill holes anywhere and I&#x27;m talking to my 8 year old about going to the store, buying like 100 feet of cable and running it the long way around the outer wall of the room etc. when he says &quot;What about the hole (in the wall, directly behind the TV and the other side is the stairs)?&quot;
To be fair, he spent time in that room and the opening in the cement block wall or whatever was full of insulation, so it wasn&#x27;t obvious, but man did I feel stupid for a minute.
And then very relieved because we already owned a long enough cable to set it up through the hole in the wall. The 100 foot cable would have been a bit of a financial burden and going to buy it and then run it the long way around would have eaten the rest of my day and this was resolved in minutes because I always encouraged my kids to ask questions and didn&#x27;t treat them like that was &quot;disrespecting my authority&quot; or something.</span>

After I came to America, I realized that I got good grades in China because I internalized the math concepts by doing large amounts of problem sets and it was actually a very slow learning process. In college mathematics courses, I realized that some of my American classmates can grasp new concepts and mental models ways faster than me, without doing much problem sets. We have just been learning math in very different ways.</span>

                              <span>Learning that some folks can produce so much value with crappy code.
I&#x27;ve seen entire teams burn so much money by overcomplicating projects. Bikesheding about how to implement DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, design patterns, complex queues that would maybe one day be required if the company scaled 1000x, unnecessary eventual consistency that required so much machinery and man hours to keep data integrity under control. Some of these projects were so late in their deadlines that had to be cancelled.
And then I&#x27;ve seen one man projects copy pasting spaghetti code around like there&#x27;s no tomorrow that had a working system within 1/10th of the budget.
Now I admire those who can just produce value without worrying too much about what&#x27;s under the hood. Very important mindset for most startups. And a very humbling realization.</span>

                              <span>In college, meeting someone that was better than me by every conceivable metric. You&#x27;d think that he beat me at one thing by neglecting another, but nope, the guy was excelling in every category. Perfect grades, involved in many communities, and generally pleasant to be around. There was no caveat, no excuse. Dude just straight up rocked.
I have met more people like that while travelling. I felt badass riding my motorcycle super far, but wherever I went, there was a greater badass riding along. Some of these travellers were on much longer journeys, on much smaller budgets, on a much worse bikes, riding offroad all the way, camping every night. Some were on bicycles, going around the world under their own power. I was just a rich tourist with a great bike who slept in hotels.
In a way, meeting those people was liberating. I will never be a world champion at anything, so I might as well play for the love of the sport.</span>

&quot;How can we design algorithms to detect...&quot; is the wrong question in response to this scandal—it&#x27;s completely in the wrong category. IMHO! These citation cliques are unsubtle and basically trivial to detect. It&#x27;s the professional work culture of research universities that&#x27;s the hard, unsolved problem.

                              <span>I was never what you would considered a singer or even an outgoing person (not that the two are the same). When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Synopsis
 How can the link between city and child be made more fruitful and enjoyable for both the child and the city? 
 At a time when a significant proportion of the city’s children are at war with their environment, the question raised by this book becomes ever more urgent for teachers and parents, citizens and policy makers. Through an enormously rich range of refere…</span>

Title: International Workers Aid To Bosnia
Subtitle: Syndicalists truck flour directly to Bosnia unions
Date: December 1994
Notes: This article, from a presentation on June 1993 at the European Syndicalist Conference, appeared in Nov.-Dec. 1994 Industrial Worker newspaper

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.

&quot;You need to share a unique thought&quot;
&quot;Your idea should be worth penning&quot;
&quot;You need to write in great detail&quot;
Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.
But today, I decided to squash that bug!
I don&#x27;t need unique thoughts. I don&#x27;t need amazing ideas. I don&#x27;t need to explain things in detail.
All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all I need to write on my blog.
So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</span>

                              <span>When I decided to start blogging again after a long absence, Bear was the platform I fell in love with. I published the first post, It&#x27;s alive!, on February 16, 2023, while on vacation in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
After about half a year, I went on a blogging tool spree. Why? I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe because of my love and fascination for the web.
I tried many different platforms. Eventually, there were three left:
Bear
Pika
Scribbles
They are all fantastic! If you&#x27;re on one of them today and find it to be the right blogging tool for you, congratulations. You made a great choice!
For me, Bear ended up being the winner. I will write a separate post on this later, but basically, it was the combination of simplicity and customization that won me over forever.
When I say &quot;forever,&quot; I mean “for the rest of my life”. I decided to upgrade to the lifetime plan. Partly because it&#x27;s a great deal, but also to keep me from looking elsewhere. This is my home, and I&#x27;m very happy to have found my way back.
I look forward to writing many more posts, but more importantly, I look forward to reading what other &quot;Bears&quot; publish in this beautiful community.
Happy blogging!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to messing with the blog&#x27;s CSS! I found this fantastic toast button by A Functioning Blog, which is everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted: the opportunity to make the toast button actual toast. Well, a croissant, in this case. Please have fun with it. Thank you so much, A Functioning Blog.
I&#x27;ve also been thinking about messing with the font on this site. I love serif fonts as much as the next guy, but I might go and change it to a sans serif for better readability. And the colors. I love the color of the blog as it is right now (off-white backgrounds hurt less than pure white!), but accent colors...
While I&#x27;m deciding, please enjoy the croissant button. It&#x27;s given me more serotonin than it should.</span>

                              <span>If anyone is perplexed or surprised why Americans are so upset about the economy, they should look no further than the Income Distribution and Dynamics in America (IDDA) recent report by the Federal Reserve Board of Minneapolis and its data site that looks at the stagnation of American income and economic mobility in America. It unfortunately confirms what we already know—the neoliberal state benefits unevenly and in ways that confound an ability to challenge it..

                              <span>One of the core responsibilities of central banks is to act as “lender of last resort” to the financial system. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has been operating as a lender of last resort through its “discount window” (DW) for more than a century. Historically, however, the DW has been plagued by stigma—banks’ reluctance to use the DW, even for benign reasons, out of concerns that it could be interpreted as a sign of financial weakness. In this post, we report on new research showing that once a DW facility is stigmatized, removing that stigma is difficult.</span>

                              <span>Becoming a PhD economist can provide a fulfilling and financially secure career path. However, getting started in the field can be daunting if you don’t know much about the preparation you’ll need and the available job opportunities. If you’re wondering what it means to be an economics researcher or how to become one, please read on. We’ll review how to prepare for a career in economics research, what an economics PhD program entails, and what types of opportunities it might bring. Economic education is a core component of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s mission to serve the community. To empower would-be economists, this post provides information for students who seek a career in economics research. We hope this information will be helpful to students interested in economics, regardless of their background and economic situation.  This information is most applicable to students applying to programs in the United States.</span>

In the months since then, she has not only quit her job, but also somehow gotten engaged AND married (in a courthouse wedding) without telling any of us. What is going on? Life is going 80 in a school zone and I don’t have my seat belt on. I haven&#x27;t even met her boyfriend (now husband) yet.
This is the third friend I grew up with to get married, and with all of them I struggle to use the right terms to refer to their partners. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t know the words. First fiancée, then husband and wife. I&#x27;ll start sentences fully intending to use the most up-to-date term but midway through &#x27;husband&#x27; will catch in my mouth and &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; will slip out instead.

MK: Hello and welcome to THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES, a podcast for and about queer and neurodivergent kids and teens living out anarchy and youth liberation. 
 Here at THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES we believe that youth autonomy is not only crucial to queer and trans liberation, but to anarchy itself. Governance is inherently based on projecting linear narratives of time and Development and gender onto our necessarily asynchronous and atemporal queer lives, and kids, teens, and everyone else affected by anti-child ageism are at the center of this form of oppression. 
 Our goal with the podcast is to create a s…</span>

 The first impression produced upon a stranger by a village in Great Russia is undoubtedly gloomy. The small, one-storied cottages have neither flowers in front nor clean, white-curtained windows. They look depressingly dark. The unwhitewashed walls are built of thick logs, if there are woods in the neighborhood, or else of rough stone. The windows, of which there are never more than three, are small, with tiny panes of glass,—for glass is expensive. 
 The straw roofs are unsightly, as in most cases they are unthatched and are merely made out of bundles of straw held together with straw ropes. Sometimes, when f…</span>

 Much has been written lately in condemnation of the free libraries, on the ground that they were chiefly used by those who cared only for light reading, and that the more serious books were rarely in demand. It is quite true that out of each six books taken during the year from the free library five will be novels. But it would be quite unfair to take no notice of the considerable number of more serious books that are read as well. Taking, for instance, the annual report of our Bromley Library, I see that during the last twelve months more than seven thousand books…</span>

 THE Russian educated woman is known to some extent in this country for the part which she took in the struggles for political freedom. Very little is known, however, about the hard, and often really heroic, struggles which Russian women have sustained simply to obtain the right to a better education; still less about the wonderful organizing powers which they have displayed in the creation and maintenance of their educational institutions. 
 If women have to struggle hard for their rights in this country, one can easily imagine the resistance they had to ov…</span>

 THE necessity of growing more foodstuffs in this country has perhaps never been so evident as it is now. That the population of these islands does not obtain from its land all that it could is no longer contested. Thus the question arises—Cannot we take advantage of the considerable numbers of Belgians, especially from Flanders, to whom we are giving hospitality, to learn something about their methods of intensive farming? Could not, let us say, several County Councils, especially in those counties where there are patches of a lighter soil, establish a number of sm…</span>

 The train had just arrived at the station of N—–, an out-of-the-way place on one of the branches of the South-Eastern system. The few travellers alighted—three men and a woman—and stood on the platform, waiting till the way was deal- to cross to the other side and make their way out. 
 The men belonged in the vicinity and knew each other. They talked together, while the woman—a young brunette, thin and poorly dressed in black—stood apart, leaning on the railing. Her eyes roved over the surrounding country and seemed to s…</span>

                              <span>One of the iron laws of people being creative on the internet is that it’s only a matter of time until the haters arrive.
Yesterday on Twitter, I saw post after post mocking the increasing popularity of bearblog, the “bear”-bones blogging platform that simply gives people a blank slate and lets them go at it. One post derided certain bearbloggers as “Mini Navals” -- essentially, amateurish wannabes in their early 20s regurgitating the wisdom of Naval without any life experience. Another mocked the entire activity of writing short essays and taking screenshots of them. &quot;Put white text on a dark blue background. The essay does not even need to be good. Follow the trend...&quot;
To the contrary - I&#x27;m loving the trend. Who cares if a few posts are cliché or badly written or a little amateurish. Sure, there’s some middling stuff on bearblog. But I’ve encountered dozens of essays that are genuinely superb. My favorite writer is Prakhesar, a Canadian who’s turned his life around in the last couple years and has taken to bearblog to tell the world about it.
In this age of spammy ads and cookie banners, the internet has become an overgrown forest. Amidst it all, bearblog stands tall as a quiet, &quot;old-internet&quot; venue -- a corner of the web well worth preserving.</span>
