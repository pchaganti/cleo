This is what I believe:
The Universe is Neutral. It Neither Loves Nor Hates You - I am all for the power of positive thinking. I tend to act as if things are going to turn out my way most of the time. Pessimistic people, and you surely know a Debbie Downer or two, are a drag to be around, and they grate on my nerves after a while. I am not a Pollyanna, though. I do not believe that &quot;everything will be all right&quot; because I am fully aware that I could be in a car accident on the way home or that my house could burn down tonight. Bad things happen to good people every day. What I believe, based on evidence, is my absolute ability to deal with whatever happens.

                              <span>Inspired by posts from Imperfect and Ava
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a while but couldn&#x27;t gather my thoughts together. I wrote that I was planning to do an online detox in December, but in reality, all I wanted was to get rid of doomscrolling on Twitter, as I was spending too much time on it every day.
How do people quit smoking? No, not through willpower - it doesn&#x27;t work long-term. You don&#x27;t smoke for a week, two, maximum several months, but you&#x27;re never free from the thought &quot;I wish I could stand on the balcony with a cigarette right now.&quot; That&#x27;s why people replace smoking with other habits - going to the gym, meditation (doesn&#x27;t help me), or some other activity where you don&#x27;t think about the old habit because you literally have no time.
Why was I on Twitter? I was bored - it&#x27;s simply a fact I didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge. So I decided - what could I replace this harmful habit with? And I came up with... games. To be honest, I played very little this year, just a couple dozen hours of Genshin throughout the year, and that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with games if they don&#x27;t interfere with main tasks and don&#x27;t cause negative emotions.
Besides games, I found a new activity - reading other people&#x27;s blogs. Until recently, I didn&#x27;t even know that Bearblog has a system similar to Hackernews, where you can see other people&#x27;s posts (thanks to Ava
for the tip). I&#x27;m very interested in reading what other people think about, especially since it&#x27;s much better implemented than Twitter, where between interesting posts you get visual garbage like memes and ads.</span>

                              <span>I feel like this is a mistake. Pat&#x27;s strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.
Intel&#x27;s stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don&#x27;t think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.
What this likely means is two-fold:
1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.
2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&amp;A but the board wants to do one or the other.
If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.</span>

                              <span>Film critic Pauline Kael, the epitome of New York sophistication, is often misquoted as having said that she didn’t know anyone who had voted for Nixon. Which is pretty funny. What she in fact said was that she knew “only one person who voted for Nixon,” that the rest of them were “outside my ken,” and that she could feel their presence only sometimes “when I’m in a theater.” Which is no longer funny, just irritating. Kael’s willful ignorance cannot be maintained outside the rarified world of New York. Yet, as the Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in her new book, the well-publicized contempt of the elites for those they consider “hillbillies” or “rednecks” significantly contributes to our current political malaise.

Settlers have killed an additional 21 Palestinians. There have been more than 3,500 attacks and incidents from settlers, many of them beatings and burnings of agriculture and homes. American-supplied Israeli rifles and bombs have wounded more than 5,000 Palestinians in the last 13 ½ months. Notably, there have been more than 100 airstrikes; airstrikes had not happened in the West Bank in more than 20 years. 18 of the 168 killed by Israeli warplanes and drones have been children. Before October 7th, the Israeli military gunned down and killed, on average, more than one Palestinian a day. In the first ten months of 2023, Israeli soldiers murdered nearly 50 children in the West Bank. Yet, many in the US believe history started on October 7th, 2023. More

Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh in central India, was then inhabited by nearly 900,000 people. The leakage occurred due to exothermic reactions that set off within a partially buried stainless steel tank containing about 42 tonnes of an extremely volatile and highly toxic chemical called methyl isocyanate (MIC), which was stored in liquid form.

Having grown up in India, I witnessed and internalized many biases, particularly around gender and sexuality. My worldview shifted when I moved for work, broadened my horizons, met diverse people, and engaged in conversations beyond the confines of my earlier experiences.
However, returning to conversations with old batchmates from Kerala brings a stark reality: some people remain unchanged. What troubles me most is their continued intolerance toward individuality. They mock people who are different, showing insensitivity that makes me uncomfortable. While I understand it&#x27;s not my place to change anyone&#x27;s personal beliefs, I worry about the ripple effects. These people are now parents, shaping young minds. Their intolerance and insensitivity will likely influence their children&#x27;s worldview.
Sometimes, I dream of a world where people could open their minds just a little bit more. Perhaps that&#x27;s idealistic. But watching those people remain frozen in outdated mindsets while the world moves forward is harder than I expected. I can&#x27;t help but hope that the next generation will choose a kinder path, even if their parents won&#x27;t.</span>

Title: Time and Being
Date: 11/25/2024

 Everything has its cost: our time, once spent, can be bought back neither by king nor trillionaire. We give up our time for what we do not want; 10-20 years for a house, 5-10 for a car, 50-100 hours per month for food, then phone bills, utilities, holiday gifts, shopping shopping shopping. We lose years to mortgage debt, car debt, student loan debt, credit card debt. Our careers become our lives. 
 In exchange for lost time we reproduce ourselves as obedient laborers, our consciousness accepts the global economic system as not only necessary but good, our taxes directly fund the imperialist monstrosities of the day, while our contribution to the GDP indirectly funds them. 
 We aim…</span>

Title: Union Independence?
Date: 19 March 1933
Notes: Originally published in Solidaridad Obrera as “¿Independencia sindical?”. English translation by Chuck Morse.

 One of the most pressing questions in our organization at the moment pertains to the anarchist’s influence in the unions. I remember past times when anarchists, who shunned rather than sought organizational posts, were seen as the best guarantee of revolutionary success, thanks to their moral solvency and especially their revolutionary intransigence. But apparently things have changed and now it is that very intransigence that is attacked most harshly. 
 “We defend the CNT’s independence,” they tell us, but then carry on about the so-called dictato…</span>

Title: Not even if they order it, Captain!

Notes: Written in response to Captain Rojas, who when asked why he carried out the Casas Viejas massacre, responded that he was following orders. Originally published in Solidaridad Obrera. English translation by Churck Morse.

 Captain, I’ve seen my comrades fall in slow death throes and then collapse on the ground, blood pouring out of their mouths, while life flees through small holes in their foreheads. These holes of death crush the skulls of their victims and comprehension in those who reflect upon them. Anido and Arlegui ordered it. 
 I’ve seen kicks destroy teeth, eyebrows, and lips; men fall unconscious only to be revived with pails of water…</span>

Now it’s just a way to make the number perpetually go up, sucking every last drop of value out of the system.
Plus the complete lack of vision or strategy from Google’s senior leadership.</span>

                              <span>The scary part is not the GPS installed by the fleet company that previously owned the car, which in all likelihood was just forgotten there, but the GPS and eSIM that comes with most (all?) new cars and that in most (all?) new cars cannot be disabled.
Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with &quot;driver impairment&quot; tech which was called a &quot;kill switch&quot;. Media rushed to say it&#x27;s not really a kill switch, just &quot;sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements&quot; and &quot;block the driver from operating the vehicle&quot;. So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497
Anyway, I&#x27;m staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I&#x27;ll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point.</span>

Title: The State and Social Economy
Date: 1902
Notes: Note In this text, taken from Pages of Social History, the author dismantles the idea that the state is a useful tool for the emancipation of the working class and that it can be used as a point of passage towards the stateless and classless society, as sustained by Marxists and social-democrats alike.

 If the fatalist law had turned many Socialists from the economic struggle, and driven the masses exclusively into electoral agitation, that would have been an evil, but only a partial one. For example, in Germany, where the Social Democratic party boasts so remarkable a success, the conditions of labor are far worse not…</span>

                              <span>Recently I wrote about needing to quit social media again, and I was debating internally even more after that. I felt like a fraud for writing about something, and not actually doing. Yesterday night, I read Sam&#x27;s post about social media, and it clicked for me.
I deleted instagram last night, and plan to stay off at least until the new year, if not longer. My big concern though, is whenever I get back on after an extended break, my newfound healthy habits get eroded away much quicker than it takes for me to learn them.
What I despise the most about instagram and platforms like it is the desensitization I&#x27;ve grown for all other kinds of media and intake. I no longer get absorbed into novels or movies, or anything quite as intensely as I used to. I&#x27;ve had to retrain myself into seeing details in things, into seeing a poem or piece in a little moment on the bus.
Now that I&#x27;m unshackled again, I&#x27;m making a conscious effort to notice the things around me more. Return to my people watching nature. In my little lounge spot in the studio right now, I&#x27;m tuned into 3 separate conversations around me. There is a deep sense of solitude in people watching alone, but also distinctly connective. I feel like I can analyze myself and my place in the world a bit better when I&#x27;m doing the same for other people.</span>

                              <span>Code reviews are supposed to be about improving code quality and sharing knowledge, but when PR comments start hitting the hundreds, something is very wrong. I’ve recently come across a discussion where a new developer joined a team and faced over 300 PR comments on their first contribution. Most of it was stylistic nitpicking. This isn’t just unproductive, it’s outright toxic.
Why This Happens
You’re Not Using Linters or Auto-Formatters
Prettier, ESLint, or Black exist for a reason. Not automating this is borderline malpractice in modern development.
Your Team Has a &quot;Style Over Substance&quot; Obsession
Metrics Gone Wild
Toxic Culture
What Needs to Change
Automate the Trivial Stuff
Focus on What Matters
Define (and Stick To) a Style Guide
Measure the Right Things
Stop Wasting Everyone’s Time
Hundreds of comments on a PR are a red flag, not a badge of honor. It means your process is broken. Fix the culture, fix the tooling, and focus on what actually matters: shipping high-quality, maintainable software. Anything else is just noise.</span>

                              <span>Although I love talking with people—whether it’s having deep chats or just exchanging simple hellos—initiating communication has never been my strong suit. Most of the time, I’ve remained passive in first interactions. However, whenever someone else took the first step, I always did my best to keep the conversation lively and meaningful.
After moving back to Japan recently and settling in the countryside, I’ve started noticing the power of a simple &quot;hello&quot; while wandering around the neighborhood. It makes me genuinely happy to receive these random greetings from strangers, accompanied by a smile. Inspired by this, I decided to try it myself.
And wow—turns out I might be more of an extrovert than I thought! Now, I don’t go overboard by greeting every single person I see (that would definitely be a bit creepy), but I’ve realized that you can often sense the vibe of another person and gauge whether they might be open to a friendly gesture. When I feel it’s appropriate, I say hello and slightly bow my head to passersby. So far, I haven’t received any negative reactions—just smiles, nods, and warm greetings in return.
For now, I’m enjoying my role as a &quot;hello-er&quot; and want to work on improving my overall communication skills. While I’m typically the more dominant side in conversations, taking the first step has always been a challenge for me. I figured that becoming a &quot;hello-er&quot; could be the first small but meaningful step toward overcoming this. Let’s see how it goes.</span>

                              <span>I’ve been an avid user of anything that makes me use tech less. I love trying it out and seeing the effects. I think I was most into it in 2016-2018 when I had read The Shallows and other books criticizing addictive effects in the devices we use. I’ve used TimeGuard, various browser extensions, ScreenTime, Cold Turkey, onesec…
I’ve mellowed out a bit since. I need less friction between me and my devices or specific websites now - both because of the websites being boring/annoying to me now, and an internal shift where I am just not as interested into online stuff nowadays. Maybe I am aging out of it, maybe I am not the target group anymore. And of course friction helps when you want to spend less time on some feed, but it sucks when you just want to edit the grocery list or respond to an e…</span>

                              <span>Twenty-five years ago this week, the streets of Seattle erupted into the kind of militant protest rarely seen in the US. Over the course of five days, thousands of street activists counterpunched the global managers of neoliberalism in the face at their own confab, humiliated Bill Clinton and took the ruling class entirely off guard. The battle in Seattle became a kind of operational template for the popular protests of the both the right and left that followed in its wake: Code Pink&#x27;s anti-Iraq war demos, the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and, even, MAGA. The populist right certainly absorbed more lessons from the Battle of Seattle than the liberal elites of the Democratic Party–to their peril and ultimate doom. More

Those brokers charged a fortune – natch, because with a 2023 city rental vacancy rate of 1.41 percent, they could set their fees sky high. But on November 13, the city council approved a new law with a veto-proof majority to make landlords fork over those fees. According to the New York Times that day, “the fee is typically more than one month’s rent, and right now the median rent is roughly $3,4000.” So up-front costs to get a new place in Gotham were often over $10,000.

The animal agriculture industry is also a front-runner for water risk, which makes it an environmentally unsustainable practice. More

                              <span>Tell that to Synapse customers. Many millions of dollars are missing.
Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying &quot;FBO&quot; accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer&#x27;s balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse&#x27;s case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I&#x27;m willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.
FWIW, after seeing &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;, I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.

                              <span>I deleted my Instagram a few weeks ago. It felt like the most difficult platform to give up in my quest to redefine my relationship to the internet and reduce the time I spent doomscrolling. There was no other social media that had a hold on me quite like Instagram - especially once their infinite scrolling Reels feature became a key part of the app. I made my first account on the app at age 11, meaning I have spent more than half of the days in my life so far logging into the platform.

                              <span>Statement from the City of London Corporation which is closing them down:
&gt; Chris Hayward, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said the
&gt; decision represented a &quot;positive new chapter&quot; for the markets as it &quot;empowers
&gt; traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their
&gt; long-term business goals&quot;.
This is a great statement. Like firing people to free them up to find jobs that better align with their desire for employment.</span>

                              <span>They are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.
&gt; All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. […]
&gt; So, no, I don’t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.

                              <span>I thought the whole point of these camera LEDs was to have them wired to/through the power to the camera, so they are always on when the camera is getting power, no matter what.
Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this.</span>

                              <span>I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate “cloud shit”, and a small part of me is convinced that literally no one actually likes it, and everyone is playing a joke on me.
I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it.
I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange.  I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.
If I ever start a company, I am going to work my damndest to avoid “cloud integration crap” as possible.  Just have a VM or a physical server and let me install everything myself.  If I get to tens of millions of users, maybe I’ll worry about it then.</span>

So...I&#x27;m supposed to be on my DevOps arc, but here I am writing a piece on Low Level programming! The pull to this path is too strong, I can&#x27;t fight it..I&#x27;ll get back to DevOps by the end of the week, I promise!
Autograd
There are great references on Autograd:
Pytorch Autograd: text and video.
Medium article
Taken from Pytorch&#x27;s website:
PyTorch’s Autograd feature is part of what make PyTorch flexible and fast for building machine learning projects. It allows for the rapid and easy computation of multiple partial derivatives (also referred to as gradients) over a complex computation. This operation is central to backpropagation-based neural network learning.
Machine Learning in general use case.
Machine Learning has been proven to be highly useful in variety of sectors:

Every time I experience a break up, I watch “How To Be Single” (2016). It came out when I was near the end of the high school and really didn’t have much dating experience. It’s almost a decade, and I’ve had a lot of romantic misadventures under my belt at this point. I’ve experience everything that movie showed. Also, I just like how charming Dakota Johnson is in this. Every time I watch the film, I relate to all of the characters more and more with every romantic connection I’ve had.

此文就是记录从我调研到购买和使用的一系列功课的汇总，如果你也桌备购入，希望能够帮助到你。
购前
🤔 如果你要使用 Apple TV 就意味着……
在中国大陆地区，想要使用 Apple TV 还是需要一些技巧的，这里作为前提先列出来：
一个 Apple ID（为了体验最大化，并不推荐使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID）；
一台电视或一台显示器；
流畅的网络环境（为了体验最大化，最好是比较科学的网络条件）；
一条 HDMI2.0/2.1 连接线（随包装不会附赠）；
接下来，我会逐一讲解上述因素。
🍎 Apple ID
使用 Apple 设备和服务的基础因素。这里需要注意的是，由于Apple TV 并没有正式在中国大陆地区销售，并不推荐你使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 进行登录和使用，因为体验会收到最大程度的折损。
使用中国大陆地区的 Apple ID 登录时，Apple TV 将没有 App Store ，无法下载新的 App。同时预装的 Apple Music 也不会显示，即使该 Apple ID 已经订阅了中国大陆地区的 Apple Music 亦无法使用相关功能。但是，若先用其他地区的 Apple ID 登录，并在 APP Store 下载第三方 APP，再切换回中国大陆地区的 Apple ID，则已下载的第三方 APP 仍会保留。
所以，如果你想要正常体验 Apple TV 的原生各项服务，下载并享受其他第三方 App，请使用非大陆地区 Apple ID，我个人推荐使用美区 Apple ID。
📺 显示器/电视
最推荐的当然是一台电视，如果你有足够大的空间的话。否则，一台合适尺寸的显示器也是可以的。比较理想的是一台支持杜比视界的 4k 电视/显…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been happily using an iPhone 8 for the last 7 years. It has been, and still is, a perfect smartphone. I&#x27;ve never bumped up against the limitations of the hardware (gaming on a phone is a bit of a mystery to me), and all of my photos and videos are synced to the cloud, so I&#x27;ve never even run out of the 64gb of storage space.
About a year ago the battery wasn&#x27;t making it through a full day. So I replaced the battery and breathed new life into my phone. It felt brand new.
But then this year,  it started happening. Certain apps become unavailable, requiring iOS 17 or later. The iPhone 8 will never support iOS 17 since Apple only provides software updates for 6 years after the device&#x27;s release date1. So I&#x27;m stuck at 16.7.10 in perpetuity.
And now I feel quite bitter. I have a perfectly fun…</span>

                              <span>The World Bank and the IMF are 80 years old. 80 years of financial neo-colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment. 80 years is enough! The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.
