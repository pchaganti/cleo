All evidence so far indicates they will not make it right, but instead they may make it even worse. Your faith is wildly misplaced. Seriously, talk to a lawyer.
Keep in mind, just because you seek advice from a lawyer doesn&#x27;t mean you need to take legal action against the school. Talking to a lawyer is not an escalation; the school doesn&#x27;t even need to know you consulted one. A lawyer will advise whether you should take legal action and any more amicable alternatives available before they do anything on your behalf.</span>

The public nature of the announcement is certainly marketing for our AI offerings as well, but at this point I think most engineers are just worried there will be additional layoffs, in the event management cannibalizes product for short term stock gains again.</span>

                              <span>Update: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.
They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.
Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.
I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing.
Update #2:
I appreciate you guys for all of your advice.
This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.
I&#x27;m not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away.</span>

But it looks pretty political in the broader context, so maybe it&#x27;s just a way of saying that certain kinds of &#x27;content&#x27; like attacking trans people is going to be ok now.

All of the articles I&#x27;m seeing about this online are ideological, but this feels like the kind of decision that should have been in the works for multiple quarters now, given how effective Notes have been, and how comically ineffective and off-putting fact-checkers have been. The user experience of fact-checkers (forget about people pushing bogus facts, I just mean for ordinary people who primarily consume content rather than producing it) is roughly that of a PSA ad spot series saying &quot;this platform is full of junk, be on your guard&quot;.</span>

But stories have an arc; there is a return from the abyss. Terrible, tragic things happen, even things which we might never heal from, but people change and adapt and weave the terrible into the story of their life. People die, but their influence lives on, their memory is celebrated and valued by those who knew and loved them. People suffer but they learn something and grow from their experiences, somehow, however awful they are. ‘Your gift will come from your wound,’ as the storytellers say.  More

Carter is lauded more for his post-presidential humanitarian projects, while his presidency is deemed a mixed bag by left and right alike. For many Vietnam War resisters – myself included, it is more personal. Jimmy Carter’s  More

                              <span>One interesting bit of context is that the author of this post is a legit world-class software engineer already (though probably too modest to admit it). Former staff engineer at Google and co-founder / CTO of Tailscale. He doesn&#x27;t need LLMs. That he says LLMs make him more productive at all as a hands-on developer, especially around first drafts on a new idea, means a lot to me personally.
His post reminds me of an old idea I had of a language where all you wrote was function signatures and high-level control flow, and maybe some conformance tests around them. The language was designed around filling in the implementations for you. 20 years ago that would have been from a live online database, with implementations vying for popularity on the basis of speed or correctness. Nowadays LLMs would generate most of it on the fly, presumably.
Most ideas are unoriginal, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this has been tried already.</span>

                              <span>I think it’s worth noting that the weekend before this, local residents of Ottawa had basically “stormed” one of the trucker convoy camps to unblock a road. There were genuine concerns that the residents of Ottawa were ready to take matters into their own hands, and it would be a bloodbath. Not to mention the blockade in Alberta where they were found with guns and a pipe bomb, with their communications indicating they were planning to murder the RCMP officers on site!
Declaring the Emergency acts was overwhelmingly popular in Canada and remains one of the most popular things Trudeau ever did. The moves to restrict access to banking affected less than 20 people (and I think they were generally funnelling money from international propaganda groups or committing similar financial crimes).</span>

                              <span>Patio11 has some good coverage of Trudeau&#x27;s handling of the trucker protest against the government&#x27;s handling of COVID-19 [1].
Whatever you think of the truckers&#x27; position or protest tactics, any punishment for their actions ought to go through the laws and court system.  Trudeau instead essentially told the banking system &quot;You can&#x27;t do business with those people, they&#x27;re terrorists.&quot;  Patio11&#x27;s words of what happened next:
&quot;The assistant deputy finance minister...said...&#x27;The intent was not to get at the families&#x27;, and when a democratic government starts a sentence that way something deeply #*&amp;$#ed up has happened.&quot;
I&#x27;m not on the pulse of Canadian politics, so I don&#x27;t really know what sins or political circumstances have led Trudeau to this point, or if he has any redeeming qualities.  Personally, I&#x27;m glad to see him gone.

                              <span>Now having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one&#x27;s team (/one&#x27;s department) and market oneself (one&#x27;s team) to your manager (/your company).
So much mental bandwidth was spent.
I also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete InputOutput expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you&#x27;ve effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is &#x27;number of suicides averted&#x27;. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that&#x27;s instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you&#x27;re doing X, but you&#x27;re really doing Y. Because you&#x27;re disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies.</span>

Clearly the author is ignorant. Canadians are sick of immigration. Young Canadians doubly so. Racism is becoming more acceptable by the day.</span>

I truly mean this in an entirely non-judgemental way. I wish the author luck in achieving his dream of becoming high agency rather than simply high freedom. I wish it for everyone who wants it.</span>

He takes one hike and throws away 60m. Doesn’t try to find anything interesting to do at Atlassian just calls his coworkers NPCs. This is zero-empathy Peter Pan syndrome at its worse.
Sad how he just goes adventure hopping to try and find meaning. The problem is no matter where you are you are also there. Time to look inward and not outward.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think you have to have Fuck You Money to get to this point. Most people eventually become disillusioned with work enough that they reevaluate what matters to them. Getting a very profitable exit is just one way to trigger that experience.
In my experience, a lot of people who get into this state start self-sabotaging hard as a way of rejecting what feels, ironically, like losing control. Sudden freedom can feel foreign and lot like your world got forcibly taken away from you. I&#x27;m not surprised the author is turning down opportunities and breaking off with his girlfriend. It&#x27;s a way of taking back control.
When this happened to me, I pivoted hard from getting satisfaction out of what I built to getting satisfaction out of developing people. Now I take great pride out of the careers I&#x27;ve nurtured...a lot more than what I&#x27;ve built, in most ways. I&#x27;ve heard others express similar ideas in different ways, like &quot;I now enjoy making other people rich.&quot;
No matter what, I encourage the author to use this time to build connections instead of destroying them (real connections...not work or SF acquaintances). Something I did not read in this essay is how he grew closer to anyone (in fact, I read the opposite). No path out of this valley involves traveling alone.</span>

I think his problem is his identity (founder of Loom) suddenly disappeared.
Now he needs to develop a new identity.
This is especially difficult for single founders without kids (in the sense that people with spouse/kids already derive much of their identity from those 2 things).
Selling a company isn’t all that different from going through a divorce (in the sense that your identity needs to be completely rebuilt from scratch)</span>

That&#x27;s a CAN-SPAM act violation.
FTC: &quot;Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future marketing email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting marketing email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all marketing messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.&quot;[1]
Experian was recently fined for making it hard to opt out of their marketing emails.
The actual regulation text:
§ 316.5 Prohibition on charging a fee or imposing other requirements on recipients who wish to opt out.
Neither a sender nor any person acting on behalf of a sender may require that any recipient pay any fee, provide any information other than the recipient&#x27;s electronic mail address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps except sending a reply electronic mail message or visiting a single Internet Web page, in order to:
(a) Use a return electronic mail address or other Internet-based mechanism, required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3), to submit a request not to receive future commercial electronic mail messages from a sender; or
(b) Have such a request honored as required by 15 U.S.C. 7704(a)(3)(B) and (a)(4).
That seems to cover it. File a CAN-SPAM act complaint (spam@uce.gov). Send a copy to the legal department of the sender.
