                              <span>I&#x27;m drinking a very strong cup of coffee.
I&#x27;m back in my own apartment after being in the country again for the last few days. It&#x27;s nice to be around my own things and have some time to write some personal email letters, read blogs, journal, and be alone for a bit.
ideas/thoughts/reading:
-Working on a zine: Summer Diaries. This will be a short edition of maybe 20 copies. Tiny snippets about my country jaunts (written on my typewriter) with Polaroid pictures of said jaunts. Each copy will receive a different Polaroid from the zine. This project is born from wanting a more physical existence, a continuation of my quest for solid/analog experiences. A tangible proof of ordinary days.

                              <span>Back in early 2016 I had a medical emergency I never saw coming and had something happen to me that resulted in my having to take early retirement. Though I am thankful it wasn&#x27;t permanent retirement to the grave.
The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can&#x27;t say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…</span>

                              <span>A story of the time I got a disciplinary hearing after hacking into CMU&#x27;s dining system.
I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It&#x27;s citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers&#x27; losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).
Similarly, CMU students are driven not by dreams of passion o…</span>

                              <span>Spending it on other projects is a bad idea:
- it&#x27;d be distracting, they&#x27;re open source devs/maintainers not fund managers
- it could be divisive and they&#x27;d risk taking flak if they get it &quot;wrong&quot;
- it creates a class of &quot;approved&quot; clients and related projects
I think the Jellyfin team&#x27;s approach is pretty reasonable.
That said, if I was them I&#x27;d probably do what the Helix devs do [0] and rather than telling people to stop donating, remind them that donations are a &quot;tip&quot; to the project and shouldn&#x27;t be assumed to be buying you anything or paying to ramp up development (or marketing or anything else). I really appreciate that stance and their attitude that it&#x27;s great to have the money and they&#x27;ll spend it if and when they need it, while also encouraging people to consider donating elsewhere if they want to have a bigger impact.

                              <span>NATO’s Washington Declaration contains a section that is puzzling. It says that China “has become a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine.” The term “decisive enabler” has attracted significant attention within China, where the government immediately condemned NATO’s characterization of the war in Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that NATO’s statement “is ill-motivated and makes no sense.” Shortly after Russian troops entered Ukraine, China’s Wang Wenbin of the Foreign Ministry said that “all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and upheld.” This is precisely the opposite of cheerleading for the war.

The failure of Israel’s two most important allies, the US and UK, to put an end to the slaughter of the civilian population in Gaza in 2023-2024 and the American and British mainstream media’s refusal to contextualize the 7 October attack raises questions about their status as democratic states. What many independent journalists and academics have described as Israel’s genocidal policy in Gaza has a parallel in America’s “Indian removal” policies in the 19th century and British colonialism in India, where violent imperial rule brought about tens of millions of excess deaths between 1880 and 1920 (Sullivan &amp; Hickel, 2022). The racist underpinnings of settler colonialism have thus been present in Western, specifically Judeo-Christian, political culture since Europeans first explored continents beyond their own. Modern day Zionism is a retrograde form of colonialism and imperialism that is rooted in 19th-century nationalist, militarist, capital-expansionist, and racist practices and outlooks of Western Europe from which it sprung.

                              <span>&gt; various European nations [...] some immigrant groups
American Jew here, who spent years living in France and Spain. I&#x27;ve heard the same polite euphemisms refering to Arabs and Gypsies from the mouths of members of the Front National. You know, before 1945 it was said in Europe that Jews weren&#x27;t able to integrate fully with the host society.
One might ask: Was that the Jews&#x27; fault? Or the host society&#x27;s fault?
It&#x27;s a relevant question. You are blaming it on the particular group of migrants involved in the case of Europe right now. But historically Europe has ghettoized other groups.
When the US ghettoized Chinese economic migrants, American politicians claimed they could never integrate. And yet the Chinese-American population is well integrated and hugely successful since the host society allowed it. Same with Jews in America, and increasingly with Hispanics.
Why is it that economic migrants do, after a few generations, become successfully integrated in America, while they tend not to in Europe?
I don&#x27;t think the evidence definitively supports the conclusion that it&#x27;s down to which group. Europe has a problem with integration that has its roots in the ethnic character of its states (something America does not have), in deep-seated xenophobia that causes social exclusion of immigrant or out-groups, and in the fact that its states&#x27; reasons for existence are based on tribal boundaries and wars for territory rather than on achieving broader democratic and economic flourishing by harnessing the capability of the whole population. And thus Europe presents neither a dream of integration nor a path toward integration (as in, &quot;to become American&quot;; there is neither an equivalent aspiration nor option &quot;to become French&quot;). And then, once again, Europe blames the groups it refuses to accept.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I&#x27;m not concerned about the crime
You may not be concerned about the crime, but many voters are. The author of the article you linked to also exhorts the Somali immigrant community to not engage in crime.
&gt; because that seems like a somewhat higher tendency until the 2nd and 3rd generation is able to make it into established society.
History and data from various European nations suggest that some immigrant groups aren&#x27;t able to integrate with the host society after multiple generations, and remain ghettoized with low employment and high crime rates (vastly higher than the native population, for certain categories of crime).
It&#x27;s clear that the national interest is in accepting skilled immigrants who migrate legally and are able to integrate fully into the host society, a la Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s dropping of the hyphen. It is not desirable to have separate ethnic groups who &quot;share the same language, culture and faith&quot; distinct from the mainstream.</span>

Eva is an incredibly gifted hacker and a responsible one, a16z should treat them better.

                              <span>I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It&#x27;s a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.
Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let&#x27;s call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There&#x27;s more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it&#x27;s completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.

                              <span>I got my commuter card in the mail this week from work, and today I used it for the first time! I was so excited about it I even texted my friend. It&#x27;s a silly thing to be excited about, considering that it&#x27;s literally just a Visa prepaid debit card with my own money on it, the only benefit being I&#x27;m not taxed for money put on that debit card. But it still makes me happy, for reasons besides the few hundred dollars it&#x27;ll save me in taxes that I cannot explain. (Maybe it makes me feel like the Responsible Independent Adult in the city that I always wanted to be.)
Back in college my friends and I would do things like leave amusement parks early to grocery shop and make healthy dinners together back at home. We&#x27;re turning into our parents, we&#x27;d say, laughing, the irony of a bunch of teenagers…</span>

                              <span>Pour bien commencer ce blog, je vais faire un article égocentrique.
J&#x27;espère que parmi celles et ceux qui le liront,
il y aura quand même 2-3 &quot;pélo&quot; qui arriveront à s&#x27;identifier à mon ressenti.
Ces dernières années, j&#x27;ai mené de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle.
Mais j&#x27;ai souvent été déçu.
Elles n&#x27;avaient pourtant pas de problèmes intrinsèques.
J&#x27;entends par là qu&#x27;a priori, je crois que les joueurs s&#x27;amusaient.
Je pense d&#x27;ailleurs que je m&#x27;amusais aussi durant la partie.
Bien sûr, tout n&#x27;était pas mémorable, tout ne se valait pas,
il y a eu des bonnes et des mauvaises rencontres,
mais j&#x27;estime que ces parties n&#x27;étaient pas &quot;mauvaises&quot;.
La déception dont je parle est plus personnelle.
Et elle va plus loin que la partie en tant que telle.

The International Court of Justice has made definitive what has been obvious for decades: It’s about the apartheid, stupid. In a sweeping ruling announced on Friday at the Hague, the Court ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories violates international law and should be ended. It determined that the occupation amounts to “annexation” of Palestinian lands and that all Israeli settlements should be evacuated and the land returned to Palestinians. It said that all Palestinians who had been forced into exile should be granted the right to return and that Israel must pay them reparations for its destructive actions. The court described Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories as a form of racial segregation and apartheid and called for the dismantling of the apartheid wall, checkpoints and other barriers to travel.

                              <span>Better satellites and other aerial survey data has determined that oil and gas  related methane emissions are far, far higher than industry reports.  Everywhere independent researchers look along the production, transmission, distribution and end use pipeline they find more leakage than has been assumed because industry has provided the numbers the assumptions are based on for years.
Along some particularly leaky production paths methane emissions are so great that the impact is greater than coal over 100 year timescale.  For example, some parts of NM Permian have a 9% (!) leakage rate.  When combusted methane releases about half the amount of CO2 that coal does.  The eGHG potential of methane is 20x CO2 over 100 year timescale, so you have to add 180% to the total GHG potential, making it 40% worse than coal w/o even considering other leakage along the pipeline.

                              <span>Some context: Students are protesting to reform the quota system. Which was abolished in 2018 after protest but recently brought back again. The Quota system basically reserves 56% of public sector jobs, i.e. 30% to relatives of war veteran.
The war happened in 1971. To get public job and avail the quota, it must be their 3rd or 4th generation now. Which is plain unfair.
But it’s not about that, the gov loyalists and their goons fake these veteran certificates to land these jobs. Bangladesh is one of the most corrupted countries in the world after all. So real veteran relatives are seldom the beneficiary.
These students just wanted to reform this system. But our fascist gov and their goons used force and killed 50+ unarmed students until yesterday (3 from my alma mater alone.) This was completely unprovoked and unnecessary. Basically any forms of dissent have been dealt with this way since 2009. No one can criticize or protest the big brother.
We have a dictatorship since 2009. People are angry - due to corruption, inflation, joblessness and tyranny. This is just some outburst of it.
When you see the videos how the police are killing teenagers and university students in the road - our future generation - no one can tolerate this.
Now the fascist gov has closed all internet and phone connection to outside world. I can&#x27;t contact my family anymore. I don&#x27;t know their well being.
There is of course more to it. But this is the summary.</span>

                              <span>I work for a diesel truck repair facility and just locked up the doors after a 40 minute day :( .
- lifts wont operate.
- cant disarm the building alarms. (have been blaring 
nonstop...)
- cranes are all locked in standby/return/err.
- laser aligners are all offline.
- lathe hardware runs but controllers are all down.
- cant email suppliers.
- phones are all down.
- HVAC is also down for some reason (its getting hot in 
here.)
the police drove by and told us to close up for the day since we dont have 911 either.
alarms for the building are all offline/error so we chained things as best we could (might drive by a few times today.)
we dont know how many orders we have, we dont even know whos on schedule or if we will get paid.</span>

That was my first thought too. Our company does firmware updates to hundreds of thousands of devices every month and those updates always go through 3 rounds of internal testing, then to a couple dozen real world users who we have a close relationship with (and we supply them with spare hardware that is not on the early update path in case there is a problem with an early rollout). Then the update goes to a small subset of users who opt in to those updates, then they get rolled out in batches to the regular users in case we still somehow missed something along the way. Nothing has ever gotten past our two dozen real world users.</span>

                              <span>Wow, this hits close to home. Doing a page fault where you can&#x27;t in the kernel is exactly what I did with my very first patch I submitted after I joined the Microsoft BitLocker team in 2009. I added a check on the driver initialization path and didn&#x27;t annotate the code as non-paged because frankly I didn&#x27;t know at the time that the Windows kernel was paged. All my kernel development experience up to that point was with Linux, which isn&#x27;t paged.
BitLocker is a storage driver, so that code turned into a circular dependency. The attempt to page in the code resulted a call to that not-yet-paged-in code.
The reason I didn&#x27;t catch it with local testing was because I never tried rebooting with BitLocker enabled on my dev box when I was working on that code. For everyone on the team that did have BitLocker enabled they got the BSOD when they rebooted. Even then the &quot;blast radius&quot; was only the BitLocker team with about 8 devs, since local changes were qualified at the team level before they were merged up the chain.
The controls in place not only protected Windows more generally, but they even protected the majority of the Windows development group. It blows my mind that a kernel driver with the level of proliferation in industry could make it out the door apparently without even the most basic level of qualification.</span>

There are so many other similarities in corrections that my family and I would unfortunately go on to discover over the years, things that until you experience them firsthand, either by yourself or a loved one being incarcerated, that you likely wouldn&#x27;t believe.</span>

Florida charges their inmates $50/day as a &quot;bed fee&quot; that they must pay when they are released. If you were found guilty and sentenced to 5 years in prison, but were released after 1 month because your charge was overturned, you still have to pay the fee for the full 5 years you would have been there.

                              <span>Crowdstrike did this to our production linux fleet back on April 19th, and I&#x27;ve been dying to rant about it.
The short version was: we&#x27;re a civic tech lab, so we have a bunch of different production websites made at different times on different infrastructure. We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.
When we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let&#x27;s file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.
Crowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn&#x27;t cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- &quot;we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it&#x27;s urgent, without testing it&quot; seems to be core to the model, particularly if you&#x27;re a small IT part of a large enterprise. What they&#x27;re selling to the enterprise is exactly that they&#x27;ll do that.</span>

                              <span>1. The government decides that prisoners can make phone calls, but they can only use a single prison-approved phone operator, and that operator is a private company.
2. The private company realizes it has no competition, raises prices as much as it wants.
3. The government is surprised with the outcome.
I would say the government is at fault here for prohibiting competition, not the companies.
It&#x27;s the 21st century, you could establish a system where any company, with an appropriate license and government approval, could offer tablets / cell phones for prisoner use, with appropriate limitations and restrictions placed on them of course. Prisoners could then choose which company they want to go with. That would instantly eliminate the problem.</span>

                              <span>Some Canonical guy I think many years ago mentioned this as their sales strategy a few year ago after a particularly nasty Windows outage:
We don&#x27;t ask customers to switch all systems from Windows to Ubuntu, but to consider moving maybe a third to Ubuntu so they won&#x27;t sit completely helpless next time Windows fail spectacularly.
While I see more and more Ubuntu systems, and recently have even spotted Landscape in the wild I don&#x27;t think they were as successful as they hoped with that strategy.
That said, maybe there is a silver lining on todays clouds both WRT Ubuntu and Linux in general, and also WRT IT departments stopping to reconsider some security best practices.</span>

                              <span>So CrowdStrike is deployed as third party software into the critical path of mission critical systems and then left to update itself. It&#x27;s easy to blame CrowdStrike but that seems too easy on both the orgs that do this but also the upstream forces that compel them to do it.
My org which does mission critical healthcare just deployed ZScaler on every computer which is now in the critical path of every computer starting up and then in the critical path of every network connection the computer makes. The risk of ZScaler being a central point of failure is not considered. But - the risk of failing the compliance checkbox it satisfies is paramount.
All over the place I&#x27;m seeing checkbox compliance being prioritised above actual real risks from how the compliance is implemented. Orgs are doing this because they are more scared of failing an audit than they are of the consequences failure of the underlying systems the audits are supposed to be protecting. So we need to hold regulatory bodies accountable as well - when they frame regulation such that organisations are cornered into this they get to be part of the culpability here too.</span>

                              <span>Throwaway account...
CrowdStrike in this context is a NT kernel loadable module (a .sys file) which does syscall level interception and logs then to a separate process on the machine. It can also STOP syscalls from working if they are trying to connect out to other nodes and accessing files they shouldn&#x27;t be (using some drunk ass heuristics).
What happened here was they pushed a new kernel driver out to every client without authorization to fix an issue with slowness and latency that was in the previous Falcon sensor product. They have a staging system which is supposed to give clients control over this but they pissed over everyone&#x27;s staging and rules and just pushed this to production.
This has taken us out and we have 30 people currently doing recovery and DR. Most of our nodes are boot looping with blue screens which in the cloud is not something you can just hit F8 and remove the driver. We have to literally take each node down, attach the disk to a working node, delete the .sys file and bring it up. Either that or bring up a new node entirely from a snapshot.
This is fine but EC2 is rammed with people doing this now so it&#x27;s taking forever. Storage latency is through the roof.
I fought for months to keep this shit out of production because of this reason. I am now busy but vindicated.
Edit: to all the people moaning about windows, we&#x27;ve had no problems with Windows. This is not a windows issue. This is a third party security vendor shitting in the kernel.</span>

Without one, you will remain stagnant at best!
You see, I finally figured out my health and fitness after many years. Over the years, I have jumped from one fad to the next, trying keto, intermittent fasting, low fat, high fat, you name it!
Additionally, I have found myself committing to a workout program for a few weeks only to switch it up on myself and try something else that seemed more exciting in the moment. Because of this constant change, very little progress was being made. In fact, I was simply maintaining at best!
Finally, I made a change to my way of thinking!

Crooks is the next variation on Kyle Rittenhouse, a fucked up white kid, working a dead-end job in a shabbily run nursing home, who ventured forth bound for glory with a semi-automatic rifle in the Republic of the Shooter.

                              <span>As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project&#x27;s overall health.
This article outlines some planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.31 release that the release team feels you should be aware of for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment.
The information listed below is based on the current status of the v1.31 release.
It may change before the actual release date.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features.
This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level.
A deprecated API has been marked for remo…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, I wrote a blog post titled “To Blogroll, or to not?” With my thought process of not adding a Blogroll to my page, but opting to add a Postroll instead. Since that post went live, I have gotten replies from both ends of the spectrum agreeing and (respectfully) disagreeing with my thought process. I’ve highlighted some of those responses at the bottom of the post under the 💬 Community Echoes, if you were curious.
Anyways, this got me really thinking about Discovery and Community, especially since I’m seeing a few articles written ranging from “WTF Happened to Blogs” to “indie blogs are doing OK: here’s how to find them”. I wanted a way to contribute to the blogging community, which has made me feel immensely welcomed since I rejoined at the end of March.
So here we go…

either because you&#x27;re too late
or you didn&#x27;t prepare enough and it has high competition
your mind and logic says: there is no way
but your brain (or soul?) says: f*ck it we do it anyway.
and somehow (most of the time) it works out!
and even if it doesn&#x27;t -- u don&#x27;t feel thaaat bad..
u say gg and move on.
that leap of faith is real!
i hope such happy ending occurs again in my upcoming move inshallah.

                              <span>this is the first time i&#x27;m revealing my age on bear, something i kept hidden for privacy&#x27;s sake. 

i&#x27;m quitting my part-time job next week. 

is it okay to be unemployed at 26? 

i think it&#x27;s mainly because i don&#x27;t like where i am right now. 

when i was a kid i picked up on things very quickly. 

i know (i hope) i won&#x27;t be stuck here forever. 

i&#x27;m still struggling, and even if i tell myself and others that there is no such thing as being behind, i can&#x27;t help but feel dissatisfied with my current situation. 

i&#x27;m trying to have faith in myself but i&#x27;m not so good on my own, so please put your faith in me as well. 
and hope with me that this too shall pass.</span>

-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don&#x27;t read them. I&#x27;m a collector of nightstand-books.
-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I&#x27;m in love.
-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.
-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you&#x27;re shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you&#x27;re wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.
-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).
-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don&#x27;t know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes I feel really bummed out I am getting 1/2 (or less?) of Google compensation. But then I open my eyes - see the workers in my daughter&#x27;s kindergarten slaving away taking care of 30 toddlers for less than half what I make, nurses and doctors working in conditions I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tolerate for more than a few months without mentally collapsing, the people in the supermarkets, gas stations, police, fire departments, social workers, teachers etc etc.
Really I don&#x27;t see what we have to complain about - whether its a 3 man startup with &quot;low&quot; compensation or anything else. 
You&#x27;re getting paid for solving code riddles the whole day.  You&#x27;re getting paid a lot. Quit comparing yourself to your friends that work in Google and try to learn how to cultivate a peaceful and happy mind.</span>

                              <span>I unapologetically love this thing. It&#x27;s of course very silly, and I&#x27;m sure commenters here are going to talk about all the ways that it isn&#x27;t practical or that it&#x27;s a niche idea, but I love whimsical silly niche hardware ideas that make it into actual hardware. I love that they put in all of the effort to figure out a mechanical linkage between the clickwheel and the digital crown!
I don&#x27;t think all hardware needs to be take-over-the-world hundred-million-unit ideas; I think sometimes it&#x27;s fine for hardware to be whimsical niche things like this Apple Watch case or Andrew McCalip&#x27;s doomscroller doo-dad [1]!

                              <span>I generally like the article but the author seems to have a really inflated view of what jobs are paying. At one point he’s claiming that a stable non tech company like a tractor manufacturer is paying 5k-10k.
Even assuming that’s including taxes so divide by two, and constraining to just software employees for that claim. There is no way the average pay is nearly a million a year. The average software engineer in the US is making around 135-150k a year and that average is including all the faang engineers with the top end salary</span>

                              <span>I will add my two cents for people who believe that this might be related only to the SWE and tangent industries: It&#x27;s really not. I have many friends (in Europe) who are trying to get through to different jobs in unrelated industries ranging from finance to fashion, or just trying to get promoted vertically (or horizontally), failing rather miserably.
Most jobs are now hoops after hoops, not taking into consideration your particular profile or the contributions you can make. Keep in mind also that a CV in the pile via a job portal is always going to be sediment at the bottom of the barrel. Try to make use of your networks and friends as much as possible.
As for my situation, I too feel a bit burned by the diminishing number of tech jobs, as I was in the process of trying to get a job via a software consultancy firm, but remained benched for 8 months. I dropped it, went back to doing corporate and tax valuations. Being underemployed is, thus far, better than nothing at all, especially mentally.

I&#x27;ve read your post a life lived diligently, and it made me want to write to you.
When I was younger, I dreamed every day of becoming a product designer. I had convinced myself I was going to go study abroad, become self-employed, and the riches and fame would be mine.
poor, depressed artist aesthetic, after which I would be discovered and prove everyone wrong about not chasing your dreams. My peers would see me on TV and gawk. Grand finale: let the curtain fall; everyone applauds.
I&#x27;m happy to say none of that came true.
The truth is, your 20s are a little bit of a bitch. These are the years someone can either be going steady with a child on each hip or they can be partying &#x27;til the sun goes down. Comparison is hard to keep at bay since everyone is going at a different pace and …</span>

                              <span>Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.</span>

Introduction
TO BEGIN...
 “We recognize that the feminist camp has made great efforts, by revealing the mechanisms that oppress women and dissidence, and by naming issues that used to be invisible. However, this does not mean that the concepts and categories, and therefore the theoretical frameworks, are all equally valid. As especifist anarchists we task ourselves with taking from these theoretical productions, the concepts and categories that are consistent with our own ideology. Referring to the guiding principles of other currents will not only lead us down a different ideological path but also have concrete effects on the militancy, on the political level as on the …</span>

I.
 It was Autumn. A carriage and a calesche were proceeding at a sharp trot along the high-road. In the carriage sat two women. One of them was the mistress, thin and pale. The other was the maid, smug, florid, and buxom. Her short dry tresses peeped forth from under her faded bonnet, her pretty hand in her torn glove readjusted them from time to time; her swelling bosom, covered by a rug, was full of the breath of health; her quick black eyes glanced at one moment out of the window at the scurrying fields, at another stared boldly at her mistress, or glanced uneasily at the corners of the carriage.

 Most of what comes out in the text “Addicted to Losing” is not new. Black anarchists and anti-authoritarians have been critiquing black non-profits, Black academics, Black activists and black authoritarians for years before the 2020 uprising. Black anarchists who have been active PRIOR to 2020 have been deeply aware of these critiques, mainly based on their experiences. We are unsure how connected the author is to Black anti-authoritarians but, best believe Black anarchists been having these conversations. There has been so much ta…</span>

___________

Yesterday, when I woke up to go for work. I always take a shower &amp; change cloths.
I was half sleep ironing my pant &amp; shirt while yawning . Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.
The bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)

Then I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .
My half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.
My grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?
I told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.
I cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).
I was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.
I felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth. I even shudder just thinking about this event.
