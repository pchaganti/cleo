                              <span>Yes. What too few people realized was that the rollout of DEI was driven by what was trending at the time, designed to win political points with the groups that were politically ascendant. These programs were never a victory for the principles or the people, they were marketing.
So it should come as no shock whatsoever that now that another political group is politically ascendant the marketing that is valuable has changed, so there go the marketing programs that were designed for the old power structure.
Change that occurs through fear of your power can only last as long as your power. Lasting change is only possible by actually changing hearts and minds. Progressives have forgotten in the last 10-15 years that the progress which we&#x27;ve won took generations not because our predecessors were weak and slow but because it inherently takes generations to effect lasting change. It&#x27;s a slow, painful process, and if you think you accomplished it in a decade you&#x27;re almost certainly wrong.</span>

I am really tired of being caught in the maw of people fighting about my identity, what I am owed, and to some extent what place my identity has in society.
To the pro-DEI crowd: I have some hard truths for you. Actual change requires commitment and focus over an extremely long period of time. That means you have to choose probably 1 cause among the many worthy causes, and then invest in it instead of the others. You can&#x27;t do everything. The problems that afflict my community are running water, drug addiction, lack of educational resources, and secular trends have have made our traditional industries obsolete.

                              <span>I wrote about my experience working as a software developer and being black in the industry and I was lucky to have it published on BBC [1].
What immediately followed, every large company reached out to have me work as a consultant for their diversity program. I found it fascinating that they had a team of DEI experts in place already. Like what makes one an expert?
In addition to my job, I spent nights developing programs trying to help these companies. Some folks right here on HN shared their successful experiences and I presented it to several companies. I was met with resistance every step of the way.
Over the course of a year and hundreds of candidates I presented, I&#x27;ve managed to place just one developer in a company.
However, most these companies were happy to change their social media profile to a solid black image or black lives matters. They sent memos, they organized lunches, even sold merch and donated. But hiring, that was too much to ask. A lot of graduates told me they never even got to do a technical interview.
Those DEI programs like to produce a show. Something visible that gives the impression that important work is being done. Like Microsoft reading who owned the land where the campus was built [2] in the beginning of every program. It eerily reminds me of &quot;the loyalty oath crusade&quot; in Catch-22.

On the one hand, you&#x27;re acknowledging rolling back DEI initiatives in part because of the &quot;political landscape,&quot; and that you were already committed to diversity on your teams. That&#x27;s all well and good, but then, why the initiative in the first place? It seems to me you&#x27;re doing at least 1 thing here, and acknowledging that such DEI program was performative in the first place. This kind of announcement seems extremely self defeating and unlikely to please anyone and piss off just about anyone that cares about this in any way shape or form, on either side.</span>

One of the games was a &quot;spot the differences&quot; between two pictures with an ever decreasing timer for each round. Using this trick I was able to easily surpass the high score, and garner a crowd watching me perform this mind numbing feat.
Probably my peak fame right there.</span>

Kim Kelly is a writer and labor activist based in Philadelphia. She is the author of Fight Like Hell: The Untold History of American Labor.
Hamilton Nolan is a labor journalist who writes regularly for In These Times magazine and The Guardian. His new book is The Hammer: Power, Inequality, and the Struggle for the Soul of Labor. More

The air quality is horrendous, and my eyes are dry and itchy. My throat is sore. Two major fires are still raging out of control in Los Angeles, the city I love, with little to no containment. Another has just erupted in Woodland Hills. Fortunately, we&#x27;re in a safe zone away from the infernos. Many more are not so lucky.
Scrolling through the latest fire updates on social media, I quickly read commenters who are cheering on the flames as if they’ve been ignited to smoke out the wealthy elites from their mansions. They seem gleeful. A few conspiracists I come across believe this is all a planned land grab (by whom I&#x27;m unsure), while others spread lies that the shadowy Deep State, the ones behind weather-altering chemtrails, is somehow responsible.  More

Like the Chinooks of the Rockies and the Mistrals of the Rhone Valley, these winds play on the mind. They tell you they’re coming for you. They whisper the dangers they bring with them. Van Gogh believed the mistral inflamed his madness. Another kind of madness seems to be inflicting LA, the madness of boundless consumption. More

                              <span>From early December 2024 to early January 2025, the body temperature of eight babies fell below any acceptable amount and they froze to death. This condition is known as hypothermia. The most recent of these children to die, Yousef, was sleeping beside his mother because, as she told Al Jazeera, of the very cold weather. Temperatures in Gaza have fallen to just above freezing, which in the context of a lack of housing, blankets, and warm bedclothes is deadly. Body heat is the only protection, which is minimal for an infant. Yousef’s mother said, “He slept next to me and in the morning I found him frozen and dead. I don’t know what to say. No one can feel my misery. No one in the world can understand our catastrophic situation.” More

Dozens of participants and thousands of onlookers thronged to the event and when, in the midst of the proceedings, the famed actor himself appeared the throng went into paroxysms of ecstasy. Seemingly equipped with endless stores of good humor, good looks, and God-given talent, Chalamet made his way through the roiling sea of admirers and impersonators and let himself be photographed with the winner, Miles Mitchell, who had come costumed as Chalamet as Willy Wonka, the title role assumed by the actor in the latest movie remake devoted to the campy chocolatier.

                              <span>Sébastien Michiels, Arnaud Natal, Isabelle Guérin and Timothée Narring have authored a paper on household debt in the North and Global South, which CADTM is pleased to publish. The paper looks at the measurement of household debt, the use of credit cards, and the gendered and racial dimensions of debt. It also proposes a reading in terms of social classes.
 Sushovan Dhar and Vicki Briault Manus have translated the paper. (...)

Throughout the year, the CADTM will be publishing analyses and documents to help us understand what happened.

                              <span>SQL NULLs aren&#x27;t weird, they&#x27;re just based off of Kleene&#x27;s TRUE-FALSE-UNKNOWN logic!
If you want you can read NULL as UNKNOWN and suddenly a whole bunch of operations involving them become a lot more intuitive:
1. TRUE OR UNKNOWN &#x3D; TRUE, because you know you have at least one TRUE already.
2. TRUE AND UNKNOWN &#x3D; UNKNOWN, because you don&#x27;t know whether you have two TRUEs or not. It&#x27;s just out there.
3. UNKNOWN XOR UNKNOWN &#x3D; UNKNOWN, because it could darn near be anything: TRUE XOR TRUE, TRUE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR FALSE, FALSE XOR TRUE... Internalizing this is where SQL&#x27;s use of NULL / UNKNOWN really becomes intuitive.
4. (TRUE AND FALSE) XOR (TRUE OR UNKNOWN) &#x3D; (FALSE) XOR (TRUE) per #1 &#x3D; TRUE. See, it&#x27;s consistent, you just need to keep in mind that if you have a lot of known UNKNOWNs they&#x27;re quite parasitic and your final outcome is likely to be, itself, an UNKNOWN. Just like in real life!</span>

Wow. Literally blackmailing a student to do illegal work (at least would be categorized like that in my country). A student that already paid money for class and potentially a degree the univ is trying to block, mind blowing. OP, 1000% lawyer up.</span>

To make it easier: it sounds like you&#x27;re still registered. University of Washington offers Student Legal Services ( https://depts.washington.edu/slsuw/ ). Set up a referral with one of them and talk to them. Even if they&#x27;re employees of the university and don&#x27;t want to work with you to sue the university itself they may be able to give you good advice about how to proceed.</span>

All evidence so far indicates they will not make it right, but instead they may make it even worse. Your faith is wildly misplaced. Seriously, talk to a lawyer.
Keep in mind, just because you seek advice from a lawyer doesn&#x27;t mean you need to take legal action against the school. Talking to a lawyer is not an escalation; the school doesn&#x27;t even need to know you consulted one. A lawyer will advise whether you should take legal action and any more amicable alternatives available before they do anything on your behalf.</span>

                              <span>I was at Salesforce for 4 years, and during those years the company made a massive deal about:
2020: the first AI craze, introducing “Einstein” as their name for their analytics platform, and officially changing the corporate vision to being the “No. 1 AI CRM company”.
2021: Now it’s all about “Customer 360”, i.e. account-based marketing, i.e. what basically everyone else does without such a memeable name. You wouldn’t believe the number of slide decks I had to sit through with all our little product logos orbiting this stock art character straight out of Women Laughing While Eating Salad.
2022: Never mind, now we’re betting the company on a real-time unified database called Genie, which was neither real-time nor unified (and eventually not called Genie either). Got sued for that one.
2024: AGENTS. AGENTS EVERYWHERE. WE ARE AN AGENT COMPANY NOW.
So, let’s see how this holds up in the face of the next hot thing.</span>

The public nature of the announcement is certainly marketing for our AI offerings as well, but at this point I think most engineers are just worried there will be additional layoffs, in the event management cannibalizes product for short term stock gains again.</span>

                              <span>Update: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.
They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.
Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.
I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing.
Update #2:
I appreciate you guys for all of your advice.
This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.
I&#x27;m not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away.</span>

                              <span>I agree that consistency is important — but what about when the existing codebase is already inconsistent? Even worse, what if the existing codebase is both inconsistent and the &quot;right way to do things&quot; is undocumented? That&#x27;s much closer to what I&#x27;ve experienced when joining companies with lots of existing code.
In this scenario, I&#x27;ve found that the only productive way forward is to do the best job you can, in your own isolated code, and share loudly and frequently why you&#x27;re doing things your new different way. Write your code to be re-used and shared. Write docs for it. Explain why it&#x27;s the correct approach. Ask for feedback from the wider engineering org (although don&#x27;t block on it if they&#x27;re not directly involved with your work.) You&#x27;ll quickly find out if other engineers agree that your approach is better. If it&#x27;s actually better, others will start following your lead. If it&#x27;s not, you&#x27;ll be able to adjust.
Of course, when working in the existing code, try to be as locally consistent as possible with the surrounding code, even if it&#x27;s terrible. I like to think of this as &quot;getting in and out&quot; as quickly as possible.
If you encounter particularly sticky/unhelpful/reticent team members, it can help to remind them that (a) the existing code is worse than what you&#x27;re writing, (b) there is no documented pattern that you&#x27;re breaking, (c) your work is an experiment and you will later revise it. Often asking them to simply document the convention that you are supposedly breaking is enough to get them to go away, since they won&#x27;t bother to spend the effort.</span>

                              <span>The ideological bits are:
* Dana White added to the board.
* &quot;Move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US content review to Texas. This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.&quot; - like people being in Texas makes them more objective?!
The actual mechanisms of running a social media network at scale are tricky and I think most of us would be fine with some experimentation. But it looks pretty political in the broader context, so maybe it&#x27;s just a way of saying that certain kinds of &#x27;content&#x27; like attacking trans people is going to be ok now.
I can&#x27;t quite FB entirely, but Threads looks like a much less interesting option with Blue Sky being available and gaining in popularity.</span>

All of the articles I&#x27;m seeing about this online are ideological, but this feels like the kind of decision that should have been in the works for multiple quarters now, given how effective Notes have been, and how comically ineffective and off-putting fact-checkers have been. The user experience of fact-checkers (forget about people pushing bogus facts, I just mean for ordinary people who primarily consume content rather than producing it) is roughly that of a PSA ad spot series saying &quot;this platform is full of junk, be on your guard&quot;.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at my Jetson Nano in the corner which is fulfilling its post-retirement role as a paper weight because Nvidia abandoned it in 4 years.
Nvidia Jetson Nano, A SBC for &quot;AI&quot; debuted with already aging custom Ubuntu 18.04 and when 18.04 went EOL, Nvidia abandoned it completely without any further updates to its proprietary  jet-pack or drivers and without them all of Machine Learning stack like CUDA, Pytorch etc. became useless.
I&#x27;ll never buy a SBC from Nvidia unless all the SW support is up-streamed  to Linux kernel.</span>

                              <span>One interesting bit of context is that the author of this post is a legit world-class software engineer already (though probably too modest to admit it). Former staff engineer at Google and co-founder / CTO of Tailscale. He doesn&#x27;t need LLMs. That he says LLMs make him more productive at all as a hands-on developer, especially around first drafts on a new idea, means a lot to me personally.
His post reminds me of an old idea I had of a language where all you wrote was function signatures and high-level control flow, and maybe some conformance tests around them. The language was designed around filling in the implementations for you. 20 years ago that would have been from a live online database, with implementations vying for popularity on the basis of speed or correctness. Nowadays LLMs would generate most of it on the fly, presumably.
Most ideas are unoriginal, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this has been tried already.</span>
