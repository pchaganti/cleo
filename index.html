                              <span>This shouldn&#x27;t be controversial. FTC isn&#x27;t banning these fees, it is only requiring merchants to disclose the fees. Why would anyone be against that?
Another good rule is click-to-cancel. Just a couple of days ago I logged into my Dish Network account to cancel it (after they hiked prices). There is no way to cancel online. There is no way to cancel via chat. You have to call. As soon as you call you&#x27;re told the wait time is over 45 minutes. There is no call back option. Why should a consumer have to be on the phone for 45 minutes to cancel? (Typically they will drop the call after 45 minutes and you have to call again.) If you call Dish to sign up service the wait time is 0 minutes: they answer immediately. If you then tell that you&#x27;re actually calling to cancel, they forward you to the cancellation number with the wait. This is an abusive business practice, and banning it should not be controversial.</span>

                              <span>Passkeys are a terrible idea. They are security theater and a disaster for users waiting to happen.
Imagine you&#x27;re on vacation and have lost your phone. You want to go to a cafe and log into a chat app, an email service, whatever to contact your family. In the world that passkey advocates want this is impossible via the passkey flow. If you can&#x27;t authenticate via a primary device that contains your private key, you&#x27;re f-ed. Service providers know this so of course they will provide recovery mechanisms. (Not consistent recovery mechanisms of course, each will have their own convoluted and likely to be broken ones). If the recovery mechanism allows for knowledge based recovery (challenge questions) then you&#x27;re basically telling people that they need N passwords rather than one password. Maybe that challenge question is just a long password (recovery key). Maybe it requires access to another system, which you likely don&#x27;t have in this circumstance. So you&#x27;re either back to having passwords, or you&#x27;re f-ed. Security theater or a disaster.
A service only has value if I can access it. I should be able to sit down at any computer in the world with the knowledge in my head and get access to any online service to which I subscribe.</span>

My aunt was alone for the last three years of her live, up to 94 years old. She had almost no visitors, and was not able to go out by herself. I went there about every week, and was always the only visitor.
Then came the funeral, with well over 400 people there, and around 200 people at the coffee table after the funeral. And I was like: Where the hell were you guys the past three years? She was alone (after her husband died) and most of you never visited her since (and no they were not living far away or unable to visit).
Go to the funeral yes, but don&#x27;t wait until.</span>

                              <span>The world’s first live-streamed genocide in the Gaza Strip, and the growing spontaneous compassion, thus solidarity, with the Palestinian victims, helped recenter priorities from the typical political and ideological conflicts back to where they should have always remained: the plight of the Palestinian people. In other words, it is the sheer criminality of Israel, the steadfastness, resilience and dignity of the Palestinians, and the genuine love for Palestine by ordinary people that have imposed themselves on the rest of the world.

                              <span>International law is by nature multilateral.  Its ontology is universal and cannot be interpreted or applied selectively, today this way, tomorrow somewhat differently -- or not at all.  In some cases violations of international law are loudly denounced by the international community; in other circumstances, comparable violations are followed by a deafening silence.  Indeed, the “crime of silence” implies tacit consent.  Qui tacet consentire videtur.  Individuals and States can thereby become complicit in the crime.  If not legally, certainly morally.

                              <span>Trump will attract liberal support, however quietly or even secretively, not because of his bridge-building genius — in reality, he couldn’t even get a bridge-building infrastructure bill through Congress in his first term — but because all too many liberals have already moved inexorably rightward on issues ranging from China and the Middle East to immigration. The MAGA minority has seized the machinery of power by weaponizing mendacity and ruthlessly breaking rules, in the process transforming politics much the way the Bolshevik minority did in Russia more than a century ago. In the pot that those Republicans put on the stove, the water has been boiling for more than a decade and yet the left-of-center frogs barely seem to recognize just how altered our circumstances have become.

                              <span>Nothing because I’m a senior and LLM’s never provide code that pass my sniff test, and it remains a waste of time.
I have a job at a place I love and get more people in my direct network and extended contacting me about work than ever before in my 20 year career.
And finally I keep myself sharp by always making sure I challenge myself creatively. I’m not afraid to delve into areas to understand them that might look “solved” to others. For example I have a CPU-only custom 2D pixel blitter engine  I wrote to make 2D games in styles practically impossible with modern GPU-based texture rendering engines, and I recently did 3D in it from scratch as well.
All the while re-evaluating all my assumptions and that of others.
If there’s ever a day where there’s an AI that can do these things, then I’ll gladly retire. But I think that’s generations away at best.
Honestly this fear that there will soon be no need for human programmers stems from people who either themselves don’t understand how LLM’s work, or from people who do that have a business interest convincing others that it’s more than it is as a technology. I say that with confidence.</span>

                              <span>This is called prototyping, which is a valuable part of the design process; some people call it &quot;pathfinding&quot;.
These are all inputs into the design. But a design is still needed, of the appropriate size, otherwise you&#x27;re just making things up as you go. You need to define the problem your are solving and what that solution is. Sometimes that&#x27;s a 1-page doc without a formal review, sometimes it&#x27;s many more pages with weeks of reviews and iterations with feedback.
Don&#x27;t forget: &quot;weeks of coding can save hours of planning&quot; ;)</span>

                              <span>My mom got hooked in 99 after she slipped on ice at her house in Bluefield, WV.
Became a full blown addict after getting prescribed for the subsequent back injury.
She lost everything, disappeared, became a homeless addict drifting from DC to Baltimore to NYC and back, until she died of an overdose of heroin in a parking lot of a 7-11 in DC in December 2015.  Her story and the impact on me and my 4 siblings is a drop in an ocean of suffering these smug assholes inflicted on this country.
This slap on the wrist is an insult to all of us, especially us Appalachians, who saw this starting in the 90s and got ignored because “hillbillies are genetically prone to addiction” as Purdue told the FDA.</span>

                              <span>There are some pretty callous comments on this thread.
This is really sad. Suchir was just 26, and graduated from Berkeley 3 years ago.
Here’s his personal site: https://suchir.net/.
I think he was pretty brave for standing up against what is generally perceived as an injustice being done by one of the biggest companies in the world, just a few years out of college. I’m not sure how many people in his position would do the same.
I’m sorry for his family. He was clearly a talented engineer. On his LinkedIn he has some competitive programming prizes which are impressive too. He probably had a HN account.
Before others post about the definition of whistleblower or talk about assassination theories just pause to consider whether, if in his position, you would that want that to be written about you or a friend.</span>

                              <span>Congrats! The design looks nice, but I&#x27;m not very fond of the website design. There isn&#x27;t a single picture of Trefolo that doesn&#x27;t crop-out some part of it. Also, every picture is in a &quot;sterile&quot; environment. It would be nice to have a picture of it on a real kitchen counter or coffee corner to put its dimensions into perspective, and also demonstrate how it &quot;fades back into the environment&quot;.
Also, IMHO, the sustainability pitch is a nice one but needs to be put down in more precise terms. It is good as it is for people who would otherwise buy a Nespresso machine, but anyone who has bought something above that level would need more convincing.
Overall, a good espresso machine already scores pretty high sustainability-wise. Apart from the used of sustainable/premium materials, a key factor to that is the replacement parts and repairability. So, how does Trefolo do in terms of replacement parts and compatibility with 3rd party parts?
For me, the future lack of replacement parts is especially concerning for the Turbina coffee grinder. The use of bespoke grinding burrs adds a wow factor and may be functionally superior to other types of burrs. But this is the one part in the whole setup that is guaranteed to need replacement down the road. What are the provisions for that? How much would it cost? And if you decide to stop selling it, would you e.g. be willing to commit to releasing the burr design so owners or some independent manufacturer can machine replacements?</span>

                              <span>My dad (age 75) got diagnosed with ALS and within a month of the diagnosis opted for MAID. He had only just lost control of one leg, but he knew what was coming. As much as we begged him for more time, he didn&#x27;t want any of it.
Till his dying breath he kept repeating how thankful he was that he lived in a country that didn&#x27;t force him to live on when he didn&#x27;t want to.
He was a clear Track 1 case, and I realize Track 2 cases are more complicated, but just wanted to add my story as reporting on MAID spins out of control in our culture war milieu.</span>

                              <span>My Canadian parents are in their 80&#x27;s so naturally a lot of their friends of the same age are dying. And two of them have been via MAID.
In one case, which was surprising to me, a man who had survived cancer - he was not terminal but certainly wasn&#x27;t getting any better - elected to die via MAID after his wife died. She passed, he called his doctor and less than a week later he was also dead. He got a chance to visit his family, apparently drive around his hobby farm one more time and then that was it. He didn&#x27;t want to deal with being alone and seriously ill.
Another friend was in renal and congestive heart failure and possibly could have lived longer but they were driving 100km daily to get to the nearest dialysis clinic and again, this person was definitely dying. So made and appointment and decided to go sooner rather than suffer along for an indeterminate amount of time.
It&#x27;s quite surprising to me, but these people are in their mid to late 80&#x27;s and of sound mind and know what they want.</span>

                              <span>I was struck by Ding&#x27;s thoughtfulness, objectivity and humility when asked how he felt after the match (while clearly utterly dejected):
&gt; How do you feel?
&gt; I think I played my best tournament of the year. I think it was a fair tournament in the end. I have no regrets.
&gt; Any message for fans?
&gt; Thank you, I will continue to play, I hope I can show strength like this time.
Gukesh was equally as objective, humble, and gentlemanly in victory.
These attributes are what makes chess and its superstars so appealing.</span>

                              <span>That was a absolutely horrible finish to a really exciting championship if you ask me.
For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, there was a lot of drama because Gukesh was playing amazingly coming into this (eg winning the gold medal on board 1 at the olympiad in crushing style) and Ding had been playing terribly. Then there were 13 games of back and forth with stalwart defending and imaginative computer preparation by both sides, playing a lot of fresh chess and both of them going for the most critical and challenging moves in each position. Ding was playing a lot better than a lot of people had expected and the previous game had been one of the best games in a world championship for a long time. Everything was tied going into the last game of the classical portion and the &quot;bar room consensus&quot; was that since Gukesh was so young and doesn&#x27;t focus at all on the faster forms of chess (rapid and blitz) and is therefore much lower rated than Ding in those formats, that if this game was a draw then Ding would be a substantial favourite in the ensuing tiebreaks.
The final game was a complex struggle, with Ding keeping everything in lockdown with the white pieces so as not to give Gukesh a ghost of a chance. Most of the pieces had been traded and it was the most drawish of drawn endgames. Gukesh was up a pawn, but they both had a rook and bishop and all Ding had to do was hang on to his pieces and keep them well away from the enemy king. On the stream I was watching IM David Pruess had just been asked by someone in chat whether Gukesh could win and he said &quot;1% chance&quot;.
Then all of a sudden Ding made 3 bad moves in a row. The first two were just poor endgame technique, putting his rook and bishop both on bad squares too close to the enemy king, then the real blunder. Completely inexplicably he traded off the pieces.  Now he was in an endgame that was just dead lost. After 14 games of 4+ hours each It had gone from being a dead draw with him a big favourite in tie breaks to all over in a few seconds.</span>
