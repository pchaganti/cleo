                              <span>There is something of a loose, informal social contract inherent to a successful human society, and that is the condition of reciprocal empathy.

The problem is the fundamental disconnect between what&#x27;s good for users and what&#x27;s good for the company.  The company wants you to have to pay them money every month and control how you interact with the product, so that they can be a services company with recurring revenue.
The consumer wants a device that they buy once and it just works.</span>

                              <span>Please stop putting salespeople in charge of highly technical product companies like Sonos. I&#x27;m so glad that Tom Conrad is an engineer by training. I hope he can turn this mess around.
The key technical change that broke Sonos was abandoning their reliable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) system for device discovery in favor of mDNS, while also shifting from direct device communication to a cloud-based API approach. This new architecture made all network traffic encrypted and routed through Sonos cloud servers (even for local operations), adding significant overhead and latency, especially for older Sonos devices with limited processing power. They also switched from native platform-specific UX frameworks to a JavaScript-based interface while moving music service interactions through their cloud instead of direct SMAPI calls, resulting in slower performance and reduced functionality.
For a more extended discussion, see this excellent LinkedIn post from Andy Pennell, a principal engineer at Microsoft with a deep technical understanding of Sonos systems. He created one of the most successful third-party Sonos apps for Windows Phone and worked directly with Sonos on their official Windows Phone 8 app.

I don&#x27;t know what Graham thinks &#x27;political correctness&#x27; would have looked like in the 1960s – most Americans still thought women&#x27;s lib was a joke, many Americans were fighting to preserve segregation, and nobody had heard of such a thing as a gay rights movement.</span>

                              <span>“Woke”, for the most part, is a boogeyman that the conservative right uses as a summary label for various political movements on the left. Basically nobody on the left talks about “woke” except for perhaps a period of six months back in 2017.
Many political groups do this: they identify some aspect of the opposition, preferably one that is easy to ridicule, and then repeat those accusations ad-nauseum. The complaints about, say, LatinX have far surpassed the number of actual proponents of it, which were a small number of people of the left. However, it still brought up again and again because it forms a useful image of what people are fighting against.
The trouble with this is that a groups idea of the “enemy” typically outlasts and often surpasses the actual enemy that idea is based off of. People on the right will write endless articles and videos about wokeness not because there actually exists a problem with wokeness but to try to gain political and social status with their political group.</span>

                              <span>I think the word “woke” means very different things to some people.
As an example I think people from the American political left to somewhere(?) in the middle see it as what it has been introduced as, that being looking past the status quo and instead looking at your own values, i.e. the morality of homelessness and not having a disdain for them but empathy for them instead.
and then on the other side it feels like the people on the American political right see it as what this website describes it as “ A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others.”
I think the divide has originated from taking unlikeable behaviour and labeling that as ‘woke’ (in bad faith of course) and some people have just bonded to that definition so much that they see it as that.
At least that’s what I’ve noticed online over the past few (bonkers) years</span>

                              <span>&gt; Imagine having to explain to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the phrase &quot;people of color&quot; is considered particularly enlightened, but saying &quot;colored people&quot; gets you fired. [...] There are no underlying principles.
To understand much of our language, Gnorts would have to already be aware that our words and symbols gain meaning from how they&#x27;re used, and you couldn&#x27;t, for instance, determine that a swastika is offensive (in the west) by its shape alone.
In this case, the term &quot;colored people&quot; gained racist connotations from its history of being used for discrimination and segregation - and avoiding it for that reason is the primary principle at play. There&#x27;s also the secondary/less universal principle of preferring &quot;person-first language&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Earlier on Wednesday, January 8th, I saw a prominent Zionist commentator and Twitter/X User post, “Has Greta Thunberg taken her keffiyeh off to address the fires in LA yet or are there too many Jews living here for her to be concerned?” The weird implications about a mythical antisemitic malice that climate activist Greta Thunberg has to supposedly fuel her anti-genocide and ecocide beliefs aside, the post is equally embarrassing in its lack of understanding about the exacerbators of Los Angeles’ most destructive fires in the metropolitan area’s history. Sadly, the disconnect that this post showcases is representative of many people and institutions, not only in explicitly pro-Israel spaces but also in the environmental movement. The US military is the #1 institutional polluter in the world. Cities across the country have been sacrificed by the local and federal prioritization of militarism and policing. Our endless wars have pushed forward the climate crisis, and now its catastrophic results are once again terrifyingly visible inside the belly of the beast. More

This policy was called the 10 AM policy, and it meant that all wildfires should be suppressed by 10 AM of the morning  More

                              <span>There are a ton of products on the market that are vastly more dangerous than computers: guns, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, chainsaws, table saws, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food. Yes, consumers do sometimes harm themselves by using these products. That&#x27;s the price of freedom. I think it&#x27;s bizarre that we treat computers as the most dangerous products in the world that for some reason demand paternalism, when none of these other products are locked down by the vendor.
The reason that computers are locked down by the vendors is not that computers are somehow more dangerous than other things we buy. The reason is simply that it&#x27;s technically possible to lock down computers, and vendors have found that it&#x27;s massively, MASSIVELY profitable to do so. It&#x27;s all about protecting their profits, not protecting us. We know that the crApp Store is full of scams that steal literally millions of dollars from consumers, and we know that the computer vendors violate our privacy by phoning home with &quot;analytics&quot; covering everything we do on the devices. This is not intended for our benefit but rather for theirs.</span>

Nobody who uses the term &quot;cargo cult&quot; in a technical settings does it out of spite or even refers to specific nations or peoples. Just refers to the core takeaway of a practice which might as we be all lore.

Turns out that a lot of people I knew posted huge life updates that I completely missed out on. I asked them why they didn’t tell me and they were confused. They said the posted it on social media. I can’t speak for everyone, but I know a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely. I have a few close friends and that’s it.
Maybe that’s an ok tradeoff to make, but it’s worth knowing that before getting into it.</span>

                              <span>People in Global South countries have agency. They can and do understand the realities of their material conditions. Apparently it is necessary to write the preceding two sentences.
You, dear reader, may be wondering why I have written such obvious statements. Don’t people everywhere possess agency, the ability to understand and act upon the political, cultural and social conditions of their community, nation and country? Yes of course they do. So why write the obvious? Because it appears that there are those, sadly partisans of the Left, that don’t believe the peoples of the Global South have agency.

                              <span>&gt; The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.
It really depends on your personal psychology. After I burnt out in a demanding role that I adopted as a big part of my identity, I joined a new company vowing to not take work as seriously (I remember telling myself, &quot;if excess effort isn&#x27;t rewarded, the optimal strategy is to maximize compensation, minimize necessary effort, and eliminate excess effort&quot;).
After a few months of recovery and ruminating on why I still felt so bad (plus therapy), I learned a few things about myself:
1. I feel like garbage when I&#x27;m half-assing something at work or not giving my all -- especially when the people around me are putting in the work.
2. When I am giving my all and I feel like I&#x27;m …</span>

                              <span>Yes. What too few people realized was that the rollout of DEI was driven by what was trending at the time, designed to win political points with the groups that were politically ascendant. These programs were never a victory for the principles or the people, they were marketing.
So it should come as no shock whatsoever that now that another political group is politically ascendant the marketing that is valuable has changed, so there go the marketing programs that were designed for the old power structure.
Change that occurs through fear of your power can only last as long as your power. Lasting change is only possible by actually changing hearts and minds. Progressives have forgotten in the last 10-15 years that the progress which we&#x27;ve won took generations not because our predecessors were weak and slow but because it inherently takes generations to effect lasting change. It&#x27;s a slow, painful process, and if you think you accomplished it in a decade you&#x27;re almost certainly wrong.</span>

I am really tired of being caught in the maw of people fighting about my identity, what I am owed, and to some extent what place my identity has in society.
To the pro-DEI crowd: I have some hard truths for you. Actual change requires commitment and focus over an extremely long period of time. That means you have to choose probably 1 cause among the many worthy causes, and then invest in it instead of the others. You can&#x27;t do everything. The problems that afflict my community are running water, drug addiction, lack of educational resources, and secular trends have have made our traditional industries obsolete.

                              <span>I wrote about my experience working as a software developer and being black in the industry and I was lucky to have it published on BBC [1].
What immediately followed, every large company reached out to have me work as a consultant for their diversity program. I found it fascinating that they had a team of DEI experts in place already. Like what makes one an expert?
In addition to my job, I spent nights developing programs trying to help these companies. Some folks right here on HN shared their successful experiences and I presented it to several companies. I was met with resistance every step of the way.
Over the course of a year and hundreds of candidates I presented, I&#x27;ve managed to place just one developer in a company.
However, most these companies were happy to change their social media profile to a solid black image or black lives matters. They sent memos, they organized lunches, even sold merch and donated. But hiring, that was too much to ask. A lot of graduates told me they never even got to do a technical interview.
Those DEI programs like to produce a show. Something visible that gives the impression that important work is being done. Like Microsoft reading who owned the land where the campus was built [2] in the beginning of every program. It eerily reminds me of &quot;the loyalty oath crusade&quot; in Catch-22.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a PoC, and stuff like this reads extremely bizarre to me. On the one hand, you&#x27;re acknowledging rolling back DEI initiatives in part because of the &quot;political landscape,&quot; and that you were already committed to diversity on your teams. That&#x27;s all well and good, but then, why the initiative in the first place? It seems to me you&#x27;re doing at least 1 thing here, and acknowledging that such DEI program was performative in the first place. This kind of announcement seems extremely self defeating and unlikely to please anyone and piss off just about anyone that cares about this in any way shape or form, on either side.</span>

                              <span>At a local bar they had a game machine, and if you got a high score on any of the games, your tab for the evening was free.
One of the games was a &quot;spot the differences&quot; between two pictures with an ever decreasing timer for each round. Using this trick I was able to easily surpass the high score, and garner a crowd watching me perform this mind numbing feat.
Probably my peak fame right there.</span>

Throughout the year, the CADTM will be publishing analyses and documents to help us understand what happened. In this spirit, we are publishing a new extract from Christoph Sorg&#x27;s doctoral thesis. This extract covers the CADTM&#x27;s action in Greece from 2010 onwards. This includes the (...)

To make it easier: it sounds like you&#x27;re still registered. University of Washington offers Student Legal Services ( https://depts.washington.edu/slsuw/ ). Set up a referral with one of them and talk to them. Even if they&#x27;re employees of the university and don&#x27;t want to work with you to sue the university itself they may be able to give you good advice about how to proceed.</span>

                              <span>&gt; I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.
All evidence so far indicates they will not make it right, but instead they may make it even worse. Your faith is wildly misplaced. Seriously, talk to a lawyer.
Keep in mind, just because you seek advice from a lawyer doesn&#x27;t mean you need to take legal action against the school. Talking to a lawyer is not an escalation; the school doesn&#x27;t even need to know you consulted one. A lawyer will advise whether you should take legal action and any more amicable alternatives available before they do anything on your behalf.</span>

                              <span>Current SFDC software engineer - this is just cover for a widespread engineering hiring freeze since the layoffs in January 2023. There&#x27;s a ton of pressure to control costs after the near shareholder revolt that caused the layoffs.
The public nature of the announcement is certainly marketing for our AI offerings as well, but at this point I think most engineers are just worried there will be additional layoffs, in the event management cannibalizes product for short term stock gains again.</span>

                              <span>Update: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.
They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.
Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.
I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing.
Update #2:
I appreciate you guys for all of your advice.
This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end.
I&#x27;m not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away.</span>
