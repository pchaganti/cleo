Imagine the lavish banquets, gladiatorial bouts, use and abuse of young men and women for the pleasure of the rich, and so much more that characterized the later years of that empire. And none of it seems that far off from the situation we, in these increasingly dis-United States, find ourselves in today. More

Within this unequal social reality, “people worry more about how they’re seen and judged.” Status rules supreme, leaving some among us “overcome with a sense of inadequacy and depression” while a fortunate few view life through an exceptionally narcissistic lens.

I will be going from basic definitions, illustrations, and explanations to the actual code implementation in this series.
Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
In the part 1 of &quot;Tensors from Scratch&quot; we discussed about what tensors actually are how the shape of a tensor can give us important information about the tensor itself. As a recap:
tensor is an umbrella term for &quot;mathematical objects&quot; or &quot;containers&quot; that have a rank/dimensionality associated with them.
Scalars are rank-0 tensors, vectors are rank-1 tensors, matrices are rank-2 tensors and so on.
One important property of a tensor is its shape. Shape is defined as: the number of elements p…</span>

                              <span>&gt; Navajo also has a complex phenology [sic], featuring sounds that don’t exist in many other languages. It counts 33 consonants, including affricates and fricatives, and 12 vowels. (By comparison, the English alphabet has 21 and 5, respectively).
Someone else clarified this [0] but got flagged to death for being a bit too harsh, but I do think it&#x27;s worth mentioning because this is used mistakenly as a prominent example of Navajo&#x27;s difficulty: the raw numbers of consonants and vowels are not particularly extreme in Navajo, and the numbers that TFA cites for English are wrong.
They seem to have done a relatively simple analysis of the alphabet, but that&#x27;s not how linguists think about phonology. The alphabet is our way of representing a much more complex system that underlies English, and English&#x27;s vowel system in particular is far more complex than the alphabet makes it appear.
Our total number of consonants sits at about 24—the alphabet alone would make you forget about some of our affricates (ch as in charge) and some of our fricatives (sh as in shush, zh as in vision, th as in theme, dh as in though), plus a nasal (ng as in ring).
Our vowel system, meanwhile, has anywhere between ~16 in American English to ~25 in Received Pronunciation. Native speakers don&#x27;t tend to realize just how complicated our vowels are, but getting them wrong is one of the most common ways to get recognized for having an accent.
All told, English has between 40 and 49 phonemes (again, depending on accent), which is quite comparable to Navajo&#x27;s 45.
I&#x27;ve no doubt that Navajo is harder to learn for most people than English is, but I don&#x27;t think the phonology plays a big role in that. English&#x27;s phonology is plenty difficult.

I might be missing context here, but this kind of problem speaks more to a company’s inability to create useful observability, or worse, their lack of conviction around solving noisy alerts (which upon investigation might not even be “just” noise)! Your product is welcome and we can certainly use more competition in this space, but this aspect of it is basically enabling bad cultural practices and I wouldn’t highlight it as a main selling point.</span>

                              <span>I believe the original studies were shown to be faulty because they didn’t account for the fact that the cases were ordered. Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.
“Danziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study—as well as other self-collected data—and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented—it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases”

I spent yesterday morning accompanying a close friend from college while he shopped for a 6 monthversary gift. I&#x27;ve met his girlfriend a few times and we get along well, which comes as a small surprise to me because while I am on good terms with the rest of my friends&#x27; partners, I can&#x27;t think of any that I would be friends with in other contexts.

                              <span>Over the past week, I have enjoyed reading various Bear Blog blogs. It&#x27;s really interesting to see different viewpoints, and thoughts that are less filtered, and more raw. It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.
A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?</span>

It&#x27;s a thoughtful place for me, but it&#x27;s also felt like a sort of put-on place, like I&#x27;m playing a specific version of myself, or like my site has developed a brand or style, which I&#x27;ve already mentioned not liking. So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let&#x27;s get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I&#x27;ll be switching to Bear&#x27;s &quot;Plain HTML&quot; theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I&#x27;m not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!</span>

                              <span>This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To &quot;bear the boredness&quot;. (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X &#x3D; the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!</span>

                              <span>Eriq&#x27;s entry in my guestbook led me to his recent post, Going from spark to a steady fire. He describes how passions often ignite intensely before rapidly fading away.
I completely resonate with this, just as he did after reading my post I wish I was more dedicated:
It&#x27;s ridiculous how well that echoes into what I&#x27;ve written above.
Several others have reached out about the same post. One email started with &quot;Dude, that&#x27;s my life too.&quot; The sender described being incredibly invested in a project one week and wanting to abandon it entirely the next.
I&#x27;ve been on the brink of shutting down this blog multiple times, as recently as yesterday. It&#x27;s hanging by a thread. I’m fighting to keep it going, but the outcome is far from certain.
It&#x27;s living on borrowed time, like a patient on a ventilator. I&#x27;m constantly considering pulling the plug. It&#x27;s like a dragonfly that&#x27;s been granted several extra lives, but now feels like its luck is running out. It&#x27;s sneaking around like a cat aware that its nine lives are nearly spent.
It might sound bleak, but it&#x27;s my reality. I doubt it will ever change. Yet, there&#x27;s beauty in it too:
I&#x27;m not alone.
It becomes so clear when we share our doubts and shortcomings. When others comment on our posts or send messages.
We&#x27;re not alone.
Blogging is a fantastic outlet for venting while also fostering a sense of community. Keeping a private diary doesn&#x27;t have the same impact for me.
Blogging is both liberating and inclusive.
I&#x27;m not alone. You&#x27;re not alone.
We have a blogline.</span>

                              <span>Recently, I stumbled across the Blaugust blogging challenge and thought it would be a good idea to participate. So I decided to join in.
&quot;Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.&quot;

I hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...</span>

Between armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.
Profitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.

Many accused the GOP of attempting to impose a sanitized version of America’s […]

I believe almost everyone, including the author here, misunderstands what made Minecraft take off.
It was NOT just the fact that you have creative control (which is what most people mistakenly assume is the main point) or that you need to learn how to craft to advance, or the procedural generation. It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!
Without exploring, crafting and building, you can&#x27;t survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.
And people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.
Pulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn&#x27;t just lucky. He mastered programming and game design and created a novel experience.</span>

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x &#x3D; 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is &quot;dimensionless&quot; i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

                              <span>The eternal problem with companies like Tailscale (and Cloudflare, Google, etc. etc.) is that, by solving a problem with the modern internet which the internet should have been designed to solve by itself, like simple end-to-end secure connectivity, Tailscale becomes incentivized to keep the problem. What the internet would need is something like IPv6 with automatic encryption via IPsec, with PKI provided by DNSSEC. But Tailscale has every incentive to prevent such things to be widely and compatibly implemented, because it would destroy their business. Their whole business depends on the problem persisting.

                              <span>This is a ruling by a District Court. It could be appealed to the Circuit Court, and then to the Supreme Court.
In the federal court system, District Court decisions are not binding precedent. Circuit Court decisions bind the District Courts in their circuit, and Supreme Court decisions bind all lower courts.
This District Court is in the Second Circuit. Another District Court in the same Circuit made a similar decision in US v. Smith, but the Second Circuit Court has not yet ruled on warrantless border searches of cell phones. Several other Circuit Courts have, however, and their rulings were all opposite of this one: the First Circuit in Alasaad v. Mayorkas; the Fifth Circuit in US v. Castillo; the Seventh Circuit in US v. Wanjiku; and the Ninth Circuit in US v. Cano.
In short: this decision is not binding precedent, and a substantial amount of binding precedent exists in the opposite direction within other circuits.

                              <span>The EU is free to pass laws preventing gatekeepers and insisting on interoperability requirements and Apple is free to refuse to do that and not offer their non-competitive gatekeeping products in the EU.
There&#x27;s zero reason to think that this will mean the EU won&#x27;t have a tech market. It just won&#x27;t have one that includes Apple products which refuse to follow the law. Seems like a massive win for the EU, and because Apple is the one deciding to pull their products rather than follow the law they can&#x27;t really complain either, so win/win I guess.</span>

                              <span>Nobody is against regulation that disfavors large incumbents to support competition instead.
You&#x27;ll struggle to find people who are against the Digital Markets Act for this reason. It literally only targets the potential monopolists.
However, virtually every other piece of regulation does the opposite.
Regulation usually gets trotted out after the downside of doing [new innovation] is experienced. This always happens, because doing something new always involves unknown risk. Most people aren&#x27;t entrepreneurs and hate risk, so they pass regulation, and the market gets locked down so nothing new happens again. Incumbents and their army of lawyers can easily comply or are grandfathered in, and challengers are permanently disadvantaged. That market is officially dead until the next fundamental leap forward in technology.
What&#x27;s different now though, is the hysteria over AI is leading regulators to pass this incumbent-cementing regulation before we&#x27;ve even had a chance to experience both the upside and downside, so the innovation never happens at all.
Combine this with a rapidly aging demography in Europe, and I only see this trend increasing. If there&#x27;s one thing old people hate, it&#x27;s risk and doing new things. Meanwhile, those same old folks are expecting massive payouts (social benefits) via taxation of the same private sector they&#x27;re currently kneecapping with red tape. While ironic, those two trends converging aren&#x27;t great for Europe.</span>

                              <span>A company that provides a phone service (mobile or other) has to conform to a large amount of regulatory red tape. Why? because either a company before tried to monopolise the entire country, or they killed someone.
Now, large tech companies haven&#x27;t wholesale killed people (unlike say tobacco, or talc powder, 3M and half of their solvents, weed killer, most car makers, etc etc)
but they have been trying desperately to stop all competition.
They&#x27;ve also been trying to extract as much personal info as possible for profit. Because regulators in the USA are hamstrung, they are used to being able to basically doing stuff that would be illegal if it were in physical stores/pre-existing industries.</span>

                              <span>The city of Cracow in Poland banned billboards (and other visual advertising quite aggressively) about 2 years ago. Great outcomes. There are still some workarounds that companies do to put this s..t out in the public (e.g. covers of renovation works can contain up to 50% of advertising area, so we have renovations of just finished buildings only to put the covers with ads). 
Now, when I visit another city when there&#x27;s no such ban I cannot stand this visual garbage.
This should be banned everywhere.</span>

It&#x27;s all happening...
Thinking about lost friendships. How one minute you&#x27;re saying i love you, and the next, they&#x27;re gone, and you&#x27;re left wondering what they&#x27;re doing with their time, and wishing you could to talk to them like it was the old days.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t written much on my blog in the last few weeks...
I&#x27;ve started some blog posts here and there but haven&#x27;t finished them. Or I simply didn&#x27;t publish them for various reasons.
Instead, I created a few slash pages, experimented with my site design, jotted down a few new ideas, read plenty of blog posts from the discovery feed and emailed with some wonderful Bear Blog bloggers.
And I had a lot of fun doing these things...
At first, it felt weird not to finish and publish any blog posts. It also caused me some anxiety. But blogging should be fun...
For me, Bear Blog is fun.
So instead of thinking too much about writing…
I enjoyed experimenting, reading and socializing on Bear Blog.</span>

Title: We Want to Be Great Like Our Crime
Subtitle: The Criminal Ego and the Struggle in Society
Date: June 20, 2010
Source: The Anvil Review

 On Isabelle Eberhardt&#x27;s “Criminal” and Renzo Novatore&#x27;s “Toward the Creative Nothing” 
 Quotes refer to the Eberhardt Press edition and the Venomous Butterfly Publications edition, respectively. 
Crime
 In “Criminal,” Isabelle Eberhardt&#x27;s memoir of land colonization in Algeria written around the turn of the last century, the farmer Mohammed Achouri cuts an interesting figure. A “tall thin old man with the face of an ascetic, his hard features set in an expression of constant preoccupation”, a quiet character who stands “a bit apart from the others”, he is not a likely hero. Though he stands out, and in fact his inability to fit…</span>

                              <span>There is overwhelming evidence that Israeli forces under Netanyahu’s leadership have committed massive human rights atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza.

                              <span>People with websites used to have a clear reason to allow bots to crawl and index our sites. Google and everyone sent us traffic. There was something of a trade off. Google has been slowly changing that trade by displaying more and more of our sites on google.com rather than sending people our way.
As far as I can see there&#x27;s no sending people away from SearchGPT, it just gives answers. I can&#x27;t see any reason to allow AI crawlers on my sites, all they do is crawl my site and slow things down. I&#x27;m glad that most of them seem to respect robots.txt.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to add that reverse engineering can also be done without any peeking at the thing you&#x27;re trying to reverse-engineer.
Andrew Tridgell explaining how he reverse engineered Microsoft&#x27;s SMB protocol with the &quot;French cafe technique&quot;: https://www.samba.org/ftp/tridge/misc/french_cafe.txt
Tridge also reverse engineered BitKeeper, the proprietary software that Linus foolishly used to host Linux kernel development for a while. He noticed that if you telnet to the BitKeeper address:port rather than use its proprietary client, you can type &quot;help&quot; and it then spits out a list of commands to try...
You can then interrogate the repository with these commands and get a complete understanding of all the internal data structures, without ever using the proprietary software, let alone having to disassemble it.
The fact that Tridge did this reverse-engineering led BitKeeper&#x27;s owner, Larry McVoy, to rescind the Linux community&#x27;s use of his software, so Linus wrote git.</span>

                              <span>As a permanent &quot;out of style&quot; curmudgeon in the last ~15 years, I like that people are discovering that maybe VMs are in fact the best approach for a lot of workloads and the LXC cottage industry and Docker industrial complex that developed around solving problems created by themselves or solved decades ago might need to take a hike.
Modern &quot;containers&quot; were invented to make things more reproducible ( check ) and simplify dev and deployments ( NOT check ).
Personally FreeBSD Jails / Solaris Zones are the thing I like to dream are pretty much as secure as a VM and a perfect fit for a sane dev and ops workflow, I didn&#x27;t dig too deep into this is practice, maybe I&#x27;m afraid to learn the contrary, but I hope not.
Either way Docker is &quot;fine&quot; but WAY overused and overrated IMO.</span>

Also, I feel like this tool selects for active commenters, not for knowledgeable experts. Not to mention throwaway accounts.

&gt; First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand.
The non-geometry problems which were solved were all of the form &quot;Determine all X such that…&quot;, and the resulting theorem statements are all of the form &quot;We show that the set of all X is {foo}&quot;. The downloadable solutions from https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B... don&#x27;t make it clear whether the set {foo} was decided by a human during this translation step, or whether the computer found it. I want to believe that the computer found it, but I can&#x27;t find anything to confirm. Anyone know?</span>

                              <span>I think it&#x27;s easy to look at this with an existing, successful business in mind - but things don&#x27;t always work out that way.
How would a business like this get started? Usually the owner is the one who invests a lot of their own time and/or money into the business to get it off the ground in the first place. Would we be asking workers to pony up in those early years when failure is likely? With Central States, the story picks up AFTER all that, when the business is already large and successful, and the owner just wants to retire.
And what happens when the business struggles or fails later? In the case of Central States, the workers were asked to buy shares from the owner, probably using a portion of the salary they&#x27;d otherwise get. IOW, they&#x27;re being underpaid relative to market, in exchange for ownership, expecting to get more later when they sell the shares. So far so good, but how does this look when the business has a rough patch, even one that&#x27;s not their fault?</span>

A bank: No! If region A goes down, do not process updates in B until A is back up! We’d rather be down than wrong!
A web forum: Yes! We can reconcile later when A comes back up. Until then keep serving traffic!
CAP theorem doesn’t let you treat the cloud as a magic infinite availability box. You still have to design your system to pick the appropriate behavior when something breaks. No one without deep insight into your business needs can decide for you, either. You’re on the hook for choosing.</span>

                              <span>Employee stock options are not a new idea, obviously.
If the story is &quot;every company should offer stock options to its employees&quot;, then sure, that&#x27;s often a good business plan. The reason not every company does it to all its employees is probably that for those employees, it wouldn&#x27;t affect incentives much and it would make payment subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day.
If the story is &quot;it should be the law that every company offers stock options&quot;, then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above.
If the story is &quot;all companies must be fully employee-owned workers&#x27; cooperatives&quot;, then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers&#x27; rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can&#x27;t sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There&#x27;s a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won&#x27;t sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers&#x27; stake.</span>

                              <span>One thing to note is that it is impossible to strip types from TypeScript without a grammar of TypeScript. Stripping types is not a token-level operation, and the TypeScript grammar is changing all the time.
Consider for example: &#x60;foo  ( x )&#x60;. In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo (x)) because bar&amp;baz wasn’t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I’m going back in time here but it’s a nice simple example.
If you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date. For people who like to stick on node LTS releases this may be an unacceptable compromise.</span>

                              <span>Like many people, my view of birdwatching (&quot;birding&quot;) and its practitioners were neutral at best, holding their stereotypical focal gear, donning vests and hats.
I learned that my friend casually did it on his walks and stuff, and was able to identify birds. That was cool, and made the hobby a bit more approachable for me.
It wasn&#x27;t until COVID when I saw a pair of cute yellow birds in the tree. Because the leaves haven&#x27;t grown in yet, I was able to watch them fly around the tree, landing in different spots, and ultimately move on to other spots. I was so mesmerized, I thought I had just seen a legendary pokemon. I immediately went to google, and found that it was an American Goldfinch.
It wasn&#x27;t really easy to find though. Google took me down an old-web looking site with the title &quot;Birds …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling rather listless about coding recently. I briefly tried some things on a sideproject website of mine to get back into it, and it was like pulling teeth. I haven&#x27;t properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there&#x27;s more to it.
I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn&#x27;t gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I&#x27;m so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩
