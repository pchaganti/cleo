                              <span>Found out that the CrowdStrike Mac agent (Falcon) sends all your secrets from environment variables to their cloud hosted SIEM. In plain text.
Anyone with access to your CS SIEM can search for GitHub, aws, etc creds. Anything your devs, ops and sec teams use on their Macs.
Only the Mac version does this. There is no way to disable this behaviour or a way to redact things.
Another really odd design decision. They probably have many many thousands of plain text secrets from their customers stored in their SIEM.</span>

Except the biggest IT outage ever.  And a postmortem showing their validation checks were insufficient.  And a rollout process that did not stage at all, just rawdogged straight to global prod.  And no lab where the new code was actually installed and run prior to global rawdogging.
I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s smoke, and numerous accounts of fire, which this can be taken in the context of.</span>

                              <span>Okay this is just getting suspicious. Their excuses for keeping the chain of thought hidden are dubious at best [1], and honestly just seemed anti-competitive if anything. Worst is their argument that they want to monitor it for attempts to escape the prompt, but you can&#x27;t. However the weirdest is that they note that:
&gt; for this to work the model must have freedom to express its thoughts in unaltered form, so we cannot train any policy compliance or user preferences onto the chain of thought.
Which makes it sound like they really don&#x27;t want it to become public what the model is &#x27;thinking&#x27;. This is strengthened by actions like this that just seem needlessly harsh, or at least a lot stricter than they were.
Honestly with all the hubbub about superintelligence you&#x27;d almost think o1 is secretly plotting the demise of humanity but is not yet smart enough to completely hide it.

                              <span>What I find fascinating/disturbing with OnlyFans and in some way with Twitch and streaming in general is more the client side than the creators. Here are basically people paying, and paying a lot, for parasocial relationships. Because clearly it’s not about the content per see which is a dim a dozen and available for free in trove.
I think it says something quite dark about our society as a whole that we have basically commoditised distress and are encouraging some people often themselves in dire circumstances to prey on others to the benefits of the middle men. I find these new pimps scarier than the old sort in that they pretend to have clean hands.</span>

* Annapurna Pictures (the parent company of Interactive) had some financial issues previously at least (see [0] from 2019) while Annapurna Interactive was doing well for itself.
* Annapurna Pictures wanted to integrate the gaming division in-house (possibly to prop up the rest of the company)
* Staff and exec at Annapurna Interactive wanted to be spin off (see [1])
* Negotiations fell through, so most exec and staff at Interactive left

That’s the problem: it’s a _terrible_ intern. A good intern will ask clarifying questions, tell me “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure I did it right”. LLMs do none of that, they will take whatever you ask and give a reasonable-sounding output that might be anything between brilliant and nonsense.
With an intern, I don’t need to measure how good my prompting is, we’ll usually interact to arrive to a common understanding. With a LLM, I need to put a huge amount of thought into the prompt and have no idea whether the LLM understood what I’m asking and if it’s able to do it.</span>

                              <span>Boeing spent $43B on stock buybacks between 2013 and 2019 while paying their CEO ~$30M/year.
&gt; To support its share price, the company under McNerney poured billions into stock buybacks instead of investing profits into the kind of research and development needed to stay competitive. McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.
&gt; McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.
&gt; McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)

                              <span>The failure is in how you&#x27;re using it. I don&#x27;t mean this as a personal attack, but more to shed light on what&#x27;s happening.
A lot of people use LLMs as a search engine. It makes sense - it&#x27;s basically a lossy compressed database of everything its ever read, and it generates output that is statistically likely - varying degrees of likeliness depending on the temperature, as well as how many times the particular weights your prompt ends up activating.
The magic of LLMs, especially one like this that supposedly has advanced reasoning, isn&#x27;t the existing knowledge in its weights. The magic is that _it knows english_. It knows english at or above a level equal to most fluent speakers, and it also can produce output that is not just a likely output, but is a logical output. It&#x27;s not _just_ an output engine. It&#x27;s an engine that outputs.
Asking it about nuanced details in the corpus of data it has read won&#x27;t give you good output unless it read a bunch of it.
On the other hand, if you were to paste the entire documentation set to a tool it has never seen and ask it to use the tool in a way to accomplish your goals, THEN this model would be likely to produce useful output, despite the fact that it had never encountered the tool or its documentation before.
Don&#x27;t treat it as a database. Treat it as a naive but intelligent intern. Provide it data, give it a task, and let it surprise you with its output.</span>

13 facts and things I love about Cocoa1
The way she lights up when she&#x27;s excited, doing those adorable hoppity hops to express her joy.
Typically, she grabs her closest toy, runs away, and then circles back when she&#x27;s excited—her unique way of releasing cute aggression.
Those little licks (kisses) as she passes by, letting me know she&#x27;s thinking of me and loves me.
When we&#x27;re hanging out on the couch, she always has to be touching me somehow, usually making sure her butt is pressed against me. Bonus points if she&#x27;s touching both LC and me at the same time.
The constant smell of Fritos, as if she&#x27;s working overtime at the Frito factor…</span>

                              <span>hello! it&#x27;s blogging time.
now that cohost is shutting down, i&#x27;m setting up a new home for whatever long-form (or even medium-form) writing i do. i&#x27;ve found over time that the microblogging formats of most social media don&#x27;t really work for me, and i like having ownership / control of my writing. so here we are.
i&#x27;m spending some time migrating some of my favorite posts over from cohost to here; you can view them in the #cohost tag if you so wish.
i&#x27;m planning to write more about my overall Feelings around the cohost shutdown soon; there&#x27;s a lot of things i&#x27;d do differently if we were to do it again, but i&#x27;m proud of what we accomplished regardless.
one thing that i&#x27;ve been contending with in the wake of the shutdown announcement is the outpouring of love for cohost that i&#x27;ve gotten from s…</span>

As someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.
Active alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I&#x27;d been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours. I was never the kind of person to keep beer in the fridge for later or to maintain a bar so that I could m…</span>

                              <span>I did not think I would ever be spinning a blog again. I think I did in the, like, pre-Google Blogger days? Or something? I was 14. I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.
This will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized &quot;here&#x27;s an important update&quot; kinda thing but that&#x27;s a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don&#x27;t think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.
So here&#x27;s a blog. How often will I post here? I don&#x27;t know! I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s actually kind of nice! I don&#x27;t need to give a shit about it. It&#x27;s a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don&#x27;t need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!
Subscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.
If you&#x27;d like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.
Thanks for reading and if you&#x27;re coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active. The community there was something I&#x27;ll cherish forever.</span>

The upcoming UN General Assembly, the UN Summit of the Future and the Global Renewables Summit all taking place one after the other in September provide an important opportunity to reiterate our demands and escalate public pressure to compel governments, international institutions and corporations to listen and take action.

Almost 60% of AIPAC’s money comes from corporate CEOs and other top executives from Fortune 500 companies. The largest single donor to the United Democracy Project is Jan Koum, the multibillionaire former CEO of WhatsApp and a regular Republican funder. The biggest institutional contributors to UDP come from FIRE, finance/insurance and real estate sectors. More

                              <span>The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More

                              <span>President Biden’s neglect of arms control and disarmament means that the next president will inherit a nuclear landscape that is more threatening and volatile than any other since the Cuban missile crisis more than 60 years ago.  The Cuban missile crisis, however, was a wake up call for both President John F. Kennedy and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, leading to a series of arms control and disarmament treaties beginning with the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963.   More

                              <span>The day after the debate, I woke up to the resounding evidence that Harris had floated like a butterfly over the proceedings and occasionally had stung the hapless Trump like a bee. He, I was assured, had done no better on tariffs, Gaza, Ukraine, abortion, climate change, or January 6 than he had with his eloquence over the Springfield protein diet. Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

                              <span>The very notion that it is acceptable to tie one&#x27;s health in a civilized nation to having ample cash is clearly anathema to most of the world, but it&#x27;s the way things are in the United States. Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More

                              <span>At a time when voters and politicians are historically divided, there is one issue that Americans largely agree upon: It’s time to legalize marijuana. Months ago, Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted that “Nobody should have to go to jail for weed.” Despite her past oppositionto marijuana legalization, she’s since become the first major presidential nominee  More

It&#x27;s the usual string of &quot;You&#x27;re absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. [Let me make another guess.]&quot;
While the reasoning may have been improved, this doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of the model having no way to assess if what it conjures up from its weights is factual or not.</span>

                              <span>This is incredible. In April I used the standard GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to help me reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol used by my kitchen fan to integrate it into Home Assistant.
It was helpful in a rubber duck way, but could not determine the pattern used to transmit the remaining runtime of the fan in a certain mode. Initial prompt here [0]
I pasted the same prompt into o1-preview and o1-mini and both correctly understood and decoded the pattern using a slightly different method than I devised in April. Asking the models to determine if my code is equivalent to what they reverse engineered resulted in a nuanced and thorough examination, and eventual conclusion that it is equivalent. [1]
Testing the same prompt with gpt4o leads to the same result as April&#x27;s GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) model.
Amazing progress.

                              <span>I love the idea of a digital garden. I first heard about them in an article by Maggie Appleton where she wrote:
Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.
I’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  It&#x27;s a place where I can experiment with creative projects and test new ideas.
Some Examples
This week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.

Neither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.
I also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.
I’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.
Over time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.
None of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.
What are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?</span>

hi! i’m Lena Raine. i’ve written the music you may have heard in indie games such as Celeste &amp; Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and slightly larger games like Minecraft &amp; Guild Wars 2.

                              <span>well, here we are again. this time in a new space. less eggbug, less (immediate) community… but still a place for me to put words &amp; hopefully have some degree of long-form posting that i’m comfortable with.
i was contemplating setting up a newsletter, and that is well and dandy, but ultimately there’s a lot of baggage that comes from blasting out emails to everyone’s inboxes every time i want to write something on a whim. that’s not necessarily what i’m here for!
i&#x27;ve done my best to port over &amp; fill out the archive with some of my game blogs and other ‘best of’ from cohost, tagging those where appropriate! and then we’ll keep on going… i hope you’ll stick around, subscribe to the rss or atom feed, whatever keeps you updated!
so if you’re new here, have a little dose of introduction:
hi! i’m lena raine. i’ve written the music you may have heard in indie games such as Celeste &amp; Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and slightly larger games like Minecraft &amp; Guild Wars 2.
i have also written and designed a visual novel called ESC, and am currently working on a brand new game called ANOTHEREAL. i’ll be introducing the game &amp; talking about its development in these little blogs, so stay tuned if you want to find out more!

                              <span>I am aware I&#x27;ve been navigating heavy topics in recent blogposts - childhood trauma, depression, and mental health in general. On Bear, I have regularly shared light, easily digestible reads, like slices of life and productivity takes. But I have also shared the brutal reality of living with mental health struggles.
I created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist&#x27;s advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.

It&#x27;s ten in the morning. I&#x27;m sitting on a wooden chair in my room. A
breeze brings a hint of fragrant morning dew through the open window. The robins are screaming their good mornings and the first maple leaves are starting to burn mauve and brown and let go of their branches. I slept wonderfully last night — a deep, dreamless slumber — and while that is likely the result of accumulated sleep debt, there is something about this place that puts me at ease. I love the chorus of cicadas and crickets, the verdant air, the quiet rush of cars passing by, the caress of my velvet bedspread, the pale yellow walls surrounding me, even the intermittent buzz…</span>

                              <span>I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.
There came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.
I continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.
While I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.
I’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.

 1. the vandalism of capitalist propaganda 
 2. subvertising; parodies of advertisements 
 3. protest art to hide advertisement. 
 Our main goal is removing advertisement from the public space. 
 As citizens we should have a say in how our public space looks, we do not accept government renting out the space to some companies, that is supposed to be for all of us. 
 We accept bus stop advertisement as a method to support the bus stop. But there is no excuse for stand alone advertisement in the public space, in this zine we will show some tactics to rem…</span>

Abstract
 The article explores the theoretical complicities between the thought of Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille. Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized. In this way, through an analy…</span>

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

That felt like a huge breach of privacy.

They politely told me to kick rocks, so I went on TWN&#x27;s website and froze that report so no one would be able to request it, and it will be a cold day in hell before I thaw it.</span>

                              <span>I have never heard of Pave before, but this just sounds like yet another copy of Equifax&#x27;s &quot;The Work Number&quot; [1].  Basically, HR at many companies gives your salary and employment history data to Equifax, who then sells access to the information to certain parties with supposed need to access it, including potential and current employers and creditors.  This report is likely one of the most invasive consumer files out there for many people.
I cannot comment on the legality of this kind of data sharing, but as I and others have pointed out, it has existed for a while.  I do agree that it is concerning.  You can freeze your Equifax The Work Number report at least, just like other credit reports.

&gt; As part of our research, we discovered that a few years ago the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD migrated from whois.dotmobiregistry.net to whois.nic.mobi – and the dotmobiregistry.net domain had been left to expire seemingly in December 2023.
Never ever ever ever let a domain expire. If you&#x27;re a business and you&#x27;re looking to pick up a new domain because it&#x27;s only $10/year, consider that you&#x27;re going to be paying $10/year forever, because once you associate that domain with your business, you can never get rid of that association.</span>

 There is but a simple difference between the standpoint of those collectivists who believe that it is useless to vote to abolish the right of inheritance after having voted &quot;for collective property, and that of those collectivists who think, as do we, that it is useful and even necessary to do so. 
 They place themselves entirely in the future and, taking collective property as their point of departure, discover that there is no longer any good reason to be concerned with the right of inheritance.

 We have stated from the very start that the beginning of a full-scale war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 is an imperialist aggression of the Russian state. That is still true. 
Our position on the war in Ukraine
“Autonomous Action” is not on the side of the Ukrainian state — and not on the side of any other state. However, in the current circumstances, the victory of Russia is not beneficial to the peoples of neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor Belarus. Fighting against Russian aggression is now beneficial to everyone except the Kremlin. It is easy to see why it is beneficial to the Ukrainian authorities. But why is it also beneficial to people (and, accordingly…</span>

WARZONE DISTRO is dedicated to challenging the very foundations of oppression, wherever it festers, and in whatever form. 
 In our interview below, we delve into the radical philosophy driving WARZONE DISTRO, exploring how they blend anarchist and vegan ideals to craft a vision of true total liberation. We talk about the unique ch…</span>

 Along the horridly neglected path out of being commanded and subjected, from the stinking bowels of the societies of oiled gears, permanent emissions, bright screens, information haze and ceaseless masturbation to worn-out sensibility, there arises a shrill hissing of such stupid nature, of such whining entitlement, that the lone rebel catches herself snickering — then nearly dying laughing . . . 
 &quot;You have a left-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a right-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a centrist bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have an extremist bias!&quot;

Title: Blackness and Democratic Modernity
Date: January 10, 2023

 “Modernity as a concept means time, the present. There are different moderns, depending on the age. From Sumerian modernity to Roman modernity, and even before and after them, there have been…many examples of modernity.” 
 Abdullah Öcalan, The Sociology of Freedom
 “The Negro’s revolutionary history is rich, inspiring, and unknown. Negroes revolted against the slave raiders in Africa; they revolted against the slave traders on the Atlantic passage. They revolted on the plantations. The docile Negro is a myth… The only place where Negroes did not revolt is in the pages of capitalist historians.”

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursi…</span>

                              <span>This post will be very plain. That is because Bear Blog is excellent in a way that is obvious and requires little explaining.  Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.
It pleases me that Bear Blog doesn&#x27;t have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals. In fact, if you look at its roadmap, you will notice that…</span>

                              <span>At the end of July, I moved my domain away from Bear Blog, and back to a site hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, thinking I would get to do whatever creative things I wanted to on my own site where I control everything. The site then sat there and did nothing, but that was fine, because I didn&#x27;t need to have an actual blog, I had cohost1 for any kind of longer-than-a-tweet writing I wanted to do.
Then two things happened.
First, I got nervous about social media. I feel weird about the way it works and the kind of interaction it encourages, and especially the way endless feeds hijack my ADHD brain. I decided to put all my accounts essentially on hold, including my cohost, and not post for a while, figuring I&#x27;d come back eventually. In the mean time, maybe I&#x27;d start blogging again?

                              <span>I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).
And then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.
Ever since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.
Yesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.
Although I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.
It was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.
And if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.

                              <span>The year is 2024. Social media is melting down and locking down their content behind increasingly expensive APIs. Websites are increasing ads to a ridiculous degree because they aren&#x27;t as profitable as they used to be. The first 5 articles on top of Google are garbage created using AI specifically tuned to maximize search engine optimization. 90% of comments on that one review you read are astroturfing accounts trying to sell you something. Youtube still cannot stop the &quot;pu$$y In BIO!!&quot; spam comments.
The bad news everyone figured out is that the internet is getting more chaotic and buckling under the stress of spam and bot accounts running around everywhere. The worse news is that nobody knows what to do about it.

                              <span>Part of the reason I sadly stopped running any exit nodes was law enforcement harassment.
I ran a few exits for about about ~5 years. In those 5 years, my hosting provider (DigitalOcean) received 3 subpoenas for my account information.
The first two were random. The 1st one was someone sent a bomb threat email to a university. The 2nd one was someone sending a phishing email.
The last and final subpoena was the most serious one. Some nation-state hackers from Qatar had ended up using my exit IP to break into some email accounts belonging to people they were interested in and spied upon them and stole some info.
Thankfully both the Tor Project and the EFF were able to help me pro-bono. The EFF lawyer that was assigned to me helped me fight this subpoena but ultimately we had to turn over my account information to the DOJ + I had to give an affidavit stating that I was simply just an operator and nothing on the server in question would be useful to their investigation (by design).
The stress of having to deal with law enforcement, lawyers, and having to entertain the possibility of having my home raided over something so silly ultimately led to me finally shutting down my exits.
Even though I had all of my exits using a reduced exit policy and I would blacklist known malicious IPs and c2/malware infra from being able to use it, I was still a target.
I feel law enforcement realizes this is a big weakness they can target since a lot of Tor exit operators are individuals with not a lot of resources to fight them. They can use the legal system to scare operators into shutting down.

                              <span>For non-EU readers, note that taxation is explicitly not a competency of the EU (i.e. Ireland can set its tax levels to whatever it wants). The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn&#x27;t, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists.</span>

Abstract
 The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…</span>

Title: Anarchists Against Counter-Revolution
Date: 9/7/2024

 There has been a disturbing trend within anarchism in the last few years. It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. 
 The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently &#x27;anarchist.&#x27; 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to &#x27;anarchist&#x27; batt…</span>

 Note: The present passage was written on 11-16 December 2002 (period of the Cyprus entry into the European Union) by anarchist prisoner Giorgos Garakasian in the jails of free Cypriot democracy. 
 Through the general secretary of United Criminals Kofi Annan the Americans and British have been attempting for some time now to impose a ‘fair and viable solution’ upon the inhabitants of Cyprus. 
 The period that we are living in is characterized by the reorganization of global dominion, which has completed its first phase of ‘anti-terrorist’ hysteria with the devastating intervention in Afgha…</span>

                              <span>They need to crack down on companies that ruin hardware (or will one day ruin hardware) when they shut off their last cloud server.
There&#x27;s no excuse for an appliance to brick itself or lose functionality just because of the manufacturer&#x27;s remote action. When I buy a device, I don&#x27;t want a perpetual, tethered relationship with the manufacturer in order to work the device. I don&#x27;t want it to ask the manufacturer for permission to run every day. I don&#x27;t want it to be dependent on the manufacturer to keep it alive. I don&#x27;t want to create an account. I don&#x27;t want to log in to the manufacturer&#x27;s servers. I don&#x27;t want them to know my IP address or my home address. Leave me alone, I&#x27;m just not that into you!
A hardware device should work on day 10,000 just as it worked on day 1. If you as a company can&#x27;t do that, you should not be able to sell the device (EDIT: OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as &quot;dependent on the manufacturer&#x27;s servers&quot;)</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know that I completely agree. To some degree, sure — most folks probably don&#x27;t notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.
But my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she&#x27;d have no idea what the term &quot;continuity&quot; means in this context. She notices that it&#x27;s easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it&#x27;s so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there&#x27;s very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn&#x27;t need to write down passwords anymore.
I think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don&#x27;t have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity — long before my mother did — it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I&#x27;m a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.
I&#x27;m also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they&#x27;re switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.</span>

Battery replacement costs at Apple are $69-99 and offered all the way back to the iPhone SE 1st Generation. That&#x27;s the all-in cost where you bring it in, they open it up, swap it out, and give your phone back to you.
An OEM battery for an Android phone is like $50.
Budgeting $69-99 once every 3-4 years hardly seems like it&#x27;s going to nuke their business from orbit.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m conflicted.
It&#x27;s absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models &quot;boring&quot;.
The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I&#x27;ll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.
She can&#x27;t tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.
You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back.
You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn&#x27;t notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn&#x27;t know they even exist.
All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.
You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she&#x27;s highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It&#x27;s not that she&#x27;s unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn&#x27;t care.
It&#x27;s becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.
I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don&#x27;t buy the pro and they&#x27;re desperate for selling points in the regular model.
If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.</span>

                              <span>You sound like you&#x27;re proud of this work and this plan and this sequence of events.
code.google going away, without the excuse that google itself was going away, after I had started to rely on it and link to it in docs and scripts all over the place, is what taught me to never depend on google for anything.
If google had said &quot;The purpose of this service is an academic goal of Googles, not to serve users needs. This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.&quot; I would not have used it.
But Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.
Do you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it&#x27;s own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn&#x27;t even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.
So thanks for all your work making the world a better place.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s a good article. The whole history is there.
The commercial side has made huge progress, too. Look up &quot;diamond making machine&quot; on Alibaba. You can buy a high-pressure, high temperature six sided press for about US$200,000. A chemical vapor deposition machine is about the same price.
De Beers, the diamond cartel, has an R&amp;D operation, Element Six. They sell synthetic diamonds for lasers and other exotic applications. The technology is good enough to achieve flaw levels in the parts per billion range, and to make diamond windows for lasers 10cm across.[1]
This is way above jewelry grade.
Over on the natural diamond side, there&#x27;s been a breakthrough. The industry used to break up some large diamonds during rock crushing. Now there&#x27;s a industrial X-ray system which is used to examine rocks before crushing to find diamonds. It&#x27;s working quite well. A 2500 carat diamond was found recently.[1][2] TOMRA, which makes high-volume sorters for everything from recyclables to rice, has a sorter for this job. This is working so well that there&#x27;s now something of a glut of giant diamonds too big for jewelry.
The finishing processes of cutting and polishing have been automated. The machinery for that comes mostly from China and India.
Diamonds are now something you can buy by the kilo, in plastic bags.

                              <span>I have mild tinnitus and the best advice I&#x27;ve ever read on the internet for it is: Stop reading. Don&#x27;t look up information about tinnitus. Don&#x27;t think about it. If you happen to notice it, try to distract yourself immediately. There maybe legitimate hearing damage but for the psychological aspect, the more you think about it the worse it becomes. I think I saw a quora answer somewhere where the doctor said &quot;Nobody complains about tinnitus while playing Playstation&quot;. And it&#x27;s very true. Until this post just now, I hadn&#x27;t thought about it in weeks (months?).</span>

                              <span>Well Sourceforge literally bundled malware for a while. So everyone had to move.

This articles about the open source distribution side but I will also point out that the number of developers who don’t realise your remote GitHub repo can be located on any machine with an ssh connection and nothing more is surprising. As in people use private GitHub repos thinking that’s THE way you work with git. If GitHub was just for open source hosting I suspect they’d have trouble monetising like sourceforge clearly did which led to scammy attempts to make money. But they always had this huge usage of private GitHub repos supporting the rest. This must have helped a lot imho.</span>

                              <span>Actually, Google Code was never trying to win.
It was simply trying to prevent SF from becoming a shitty monoculture that hurt everyone, which it was when Google Code launched.  Google was 100% consistent on this from the day it launched to the day it folded. It was not trying to make money, or whatever
I was there, working on it, when it was 4 of us :)
So to write all these funny things about taste or what not, is totally besides the point.
We folded it up because we achieved the goal we sought at the time, and didn&#x27;t see a reason to continue.
People could get a good experience with the competition that now existed, and we would have just ended up cannibalizing the market.
So we chose to exit, and worked with Github/bitbucket/others to provide migration tools.
All of this would have been easy to find out simply by asking, but it appears nobody bothers to actually ask other people things anymore, and I guess that doesn&#x27;t make as good a story as &quot;we totally destroyed them because they had no taste, so they up and folded&quot;.</span>

This gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It&#x27;s also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.
Actually, the gallery add-on itself isn&#x27;t very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here&#x27;s the result (instructions below):









Instructions
The gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a &quot;section&quot;) with the class gallery. Example:


* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Since the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:


* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Finally, add the following styles to your theme:
/* Gallery */
.gallery ul  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
  padding: 20px 0;
  list-style: none;
}
.gallery li {
  position: relative;
  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


There have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.
I hope you find the gallery useful!</span>
