 One time, maybe ten years back, I was on the DC metro with my family. My brother and I were happily talking about the feminist implications of GI Joe, because my brother is cool as hell, when a stranger looked over at my father (not knowing we were related) to complain about how I spoke. 
 “They really don’t teach people how to speak English anymore,” the stranger complained. 
 I’m not the world’s fighty-est person, but I’ve also never been the world’s least fighty person, so I confronted him immediately. “Oh?!” I asked. “What’s wrong with the way we’re talking?!”

 There’s not much to be said about an episode of repression, after all it’s the simple cyclical occurrence of action and reaction – or even on how repression plays dirty – another well-known fact. At most these are just a few notes on the development of techniques and strategies. 
 This I’ll try to do. More than a year after the arrests, with the trial already underway, a crack has opened in the censuring bell jar and the court papers been disclosed in all their misery after the short report on the last issue of Croce Nera and the latest developments on the closure of investigatio…</span>

 148 years ago this week, on April 6, 1871, armed participants in the revolutionary Paris Commune seized the guillotine that was stored near the prison in Paris. They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians. At the time, the Commune controlled Paris, which was st…</span>

Title: Dining with Vultures
Subtitle: Bristol Anarchists &amp; the UK Media

Source: Retrieved on July 13, 2024 from https://darknights.noblogs.org/post/2024/07/13/dining-with-vultures-bristol-anarchists-the-uk-media/

 The purpose of this piece is to better understanding of mass media’s relationship to rebels (including anarchists of all stripes), in general as well as in the context of a repressive atmosphere in Bristol. As well as raising local specifics, it hopes to encourage stronger awareness around wider issues of representation and counter-insurgency.

I am active in very few Discord servers and most of them are small, friends-only groups. However, in the few public ones I am in, I often see groups of people whose choices of words and how to express themselves, how to enter conversations, their tone and views make them feel eerily... unreal. I&#x27;ve thought about it, and the best way I could describe it is as if someone trained AI on the most active Twitter users.

THE TWILIGHT ZONE — Picture if you will the citizens of a small town in Northeast Ohio, facing a daunting toxic threat yet trapped in a maze of regulatory capture at the so-called Environmental Protection Agency. Not the citizens of East Palestine, though they too face a challenging quest for the truth about the environmental health threats they may face. But the citizens in and around Uniontown, Ohio have been trapped in such a quagmire for decades, subjected to a dystopian level of gaslighting from the powers that be in an effort to bury the truth regarding the ultra-hazardous poisons reportedly dumped at the town landfill.
The Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL) in Uniontown closed in 1980 and was designated as an EPA Superfund site in 1984, listed as one of the most contaminated sites in the country. Akron area rubber companies were the biggest known polluters at the IEL, dumping millions of gallons of industrial waste and chemicals in the ‘60s and ‘70s. But local citizen eyewitnesses have long testified that the U.S. military was another covert client in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s. This includes the IEL’s former owner Charles Kittinger, who came forward in 2001 to speak of clandestine dumping of three metal eggs of nuclear weapons waste he was eerily warned not to speak of.

We are endlessly and repetitively treated to sermons on the wonders of capitalism. Everybody will be taken care of, with the proviso that you are willing to work. As I have had frequent cause to note, that a line has to be furiously propagated across every channel speaks to a lack of concrete reality. And as more people, especially young people, see that they have declining possibilities, more questioning inevitably arises.
The only thing worse in capitalism to having a job, however unpleasant, is not having a job. Unemployment benefits are barely at starvation rates and end all too soon. Naturally, that is worse in the United States than most other advanced capitalist countries of the Global North. Six months is the limit set at a rate well less than half of what your wages were in the job you just lost. And given that six months is the average time necessary to secure new employment, that means around half of those collecting unemployment insurance will likely have a spell of no income at all.

                              <span>This time around in New York I&#x27;ve not been diligently documenting where I&#x27;ve been and gone to eat. Part of me says who cares, nobody actually pays attention anyway and you don&#x27;t look back much either. The other thinks I&#x27;ll regret it in the future.
I&#x27;m making my way through Joan Didion&#x27;s essay &quot;On Keeping a Notebook&quot; from Slouching Towards Bethlehem; some of the passages in there comfort me:
Why did I write it down? In order to remember, of course, but exactly what was it I wanted to remember? How much of it actually happened? Did any of it? Why do I keep a notebook at all? It is easy to deceive oneself on all those scores. The impulse to write things down is a peculiarly compulsive one, inexplicable to those who do not share it, useful only accidentally, only secondarily, in the way that a…</span>

My friends&#x27; (let&#x27;s call them Riley and Taylor) baby was SO cute and hilarious (as babies almost always are) &amp; I have a soft spot for kids a mile wide, so I was really pleased when he started grinning at me outright instead of giving me suspicious little side-eye looks of Mom, why is she still here? everytime I showed up in the same room.
While some plans fell through, new ones happened pretty spontaneously and I think it all balanced out well. Riley is really organized &amp; a great planner, so I think she had some stuff on the back burner for if I choked and…</span>

                              <span>spotify is legal piracy. you can listen to most of your music by just paying a small amount and most of that doesn&#x27;t go to the artist. hell with the rise of AI, enshittification got to a level that it never has before. I just don&#x27;t want to be a part of that anymore.
there is also another reason I&#x27;m doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.

how I manage it
I download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn&#x27;t get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.
I use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.
notes
you can also take a look at kit&#x27;s post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.

                              <span>Yesterday I was watching a Swedish music documentary. In one of the scenes, the artist Errol (aka Eddie Meduza) says:
If you think too much, you go crazy. Take life as it comes.
True words — and all too easy to forget. We put so much emphasis on thinking in our modern society that the gut feeling, the inner vibe, has been overshadowed. We think like crazy, even in moments when thinking brings nothing but confusion and fatigue.
Thinking has an important role, of course. We can make great use of this ability to plan, prepare, and make calculated decisions. But often the best thing we can do is &quot;take life as it comes.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I wrote this to solve a few things I cared about.
* I want to show people that native WebRTC players can be a thing. I hope this encourages hangouts/discord/$x to implement WHIP and WHEP it would let people do so much more
* I wanted to make low latency sharing easier. I saw the need for this working on adding WebRTC to OBS and Broadcast Box[0]
* I wanted to show devs what a great ecosystem exists for WebRTC. Lots of great implementations in different languages.
* Was a bit of a ‘frustration project’. I saw a company claiming only their proprietary protocol can do latency this low. So I thought ‘screw you I will make an open source version!’

                              <span>The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn&#x27;t miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.
Perhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn&#x27;t a failure, it&#x27;s essential, especially for problems in systems you&#x27;ve never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn&#x27;t signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.</span>

                              <span>Until the US federal government pays civilian tech talent competitively, this is always going to be an issue.
Your typical hands-on-keyboard blue team engineer in federal government is a GS-12 getting paid around $68,000 per year (or $99k in very high cost of living areas like DC). They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.
The best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.
As a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.
If there&#x27;s one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They&#x27;ve done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.</span>

Laws related to data breaches need to have much sharper teeth. Companies are going to do the bare minimum when it comes to securing data as long as breaches have almost no real consequences. Maybe pierce the corporate veil and criminally prosecute those whose negligence made this possible. Maybe have fines that are so massive that company leadership and stockholders face real consequences.</span>

                              <span>I never got the impression that the market ever cares about data breaches. It seems most companies are rarely held financially responsible for data breaches anyway.
I would bet any effects you’re seeing in stocks is unrelated to this news.</span>

                              <span>writers who follow the rules oft forget that breaking rules is itself a form of expression — sometimes more expressive than words themselves can be.
a lack of capitalization could denote a quiet voice or a flippant attitude depending on the context.
at the end of the day, words are tools for us to use, and we can bend them, twist them, warp them, and break them however we want.
maybe their blog is simply about the aesthetics of their own expression.
i find it much more interesting to wonder why rules are being broken rather than attempt to enforce them, personally.

                              <span>So, these wont be the traditional notes where you write down your understanding or something. No. Never worked for me. Too boring and I never actually read again. What works is just having a bunch of questions that I can answer again and understand. So thats what it would be. Do it with your favorite llm for additional fun but take the effort to answer yourself first. That is the point.
And for the blog part, I will write if I feel I can add some new value by connecting things or simplify things down in a unique way.

Notes: Excerpted from Party-Political Peasant-Central Discourse in the Day of the Ukrainian Revolution 1917–1921: Ideological Types and Mobilization Possibilites. doi:10.36059/978-966-397-236-7/53-72.

 Left and far-left forces dominated the Ukrainian political space. After the February Revolution of 1917, N.

Those impositions broke with and departed from the previous half century’s policies favoring “free trade” (less or minimal government intervention in international markets). Free trade policies facilitated “globalization,” the euphemism for the post-1970 surge in U.S. corporations’ investing abroad: producing and distributing there, re-locating operations there, and merging with foreign enterprises there.

By the time it is released, assuming production starts sooner rather than later, the follow-up will pick-up almost twenty-years after events of the original film.

                              <span>There are some people around us who live on a totally different frequency, especially in the work environment.
They never shut up.
They always seek a chance to talk to you.
They don&#x27;t let you have a peaceful and silent moment.
They talk but don&#x27;t say anything.
They do not understand that we just need peaceful and silent moment.
They do not understand that we don&#x27;t like them.
They expect attention and response.
It is hell when I see them around. I just cannot escape. I usually try to put my headphones on and listen to music at full volume. But this time, they wave their hand at me to talk to me - and in that moment I want to scream.
It does not matter if you give them very short answers and ignore. They never stop.

Because of this, I developed a habit of looking at the floor so that I won&#x27;t have eye contact with them. Sometimes I close my eyes and pretend to be sleeping. It&#x27;s so difficult to be kind sometimes. 

My social battery is already pretty weak and people who live on a different frequency are just torturing my soul. People like me should work at a cave or something like that. I lose my sanity when I want peaceful moment while having no escape.</span>

                              <span>My apartment doesn&#x27;t have power.
They&#x27;re doing some kind of maintenance.
The air is hot and thick, and I&#x27;m pining for some AC.
Took the doggo out for our morning walk and stopped at Timmies to get a coffee and breakfast sandwich, then remembered I had to walk up four flights of stairs bc—no power.
K drove me back to the city last night, and as much as I miss being in the country...coming home to my own apartment and bed felt nice.
As I was falling asleep, I saw the tiniest of ants crawling up my arm, and immediately murder, death, kill for that little guy and of course I then googled what would happen if an ant crawled into your ear and nothing good came out of that.
I distracted myself by watching some ASMR and fell asleep in my perfectly temperature-controlled bedroom (K&#x27;s apartment is a veritable icebox).
** his mom crocheted me a shawl(!!!), and I think my heart imploded. Nothing says i love you more than here...I made you something.

Title: Swedish Unions in Crisis – What Solutions Do Syndicalists Offer?

Swedish unions are governed from the top down and are therefore bad at serving workers&#x27; interests. So writes Rasmus Hästbacka of the syndicalist union SAC. Based on his new book, he suggests how worker-led unions can be rebuilt.
 It’s a truism that capitalism is not a democracy; capitalism means economic dictatorship, which is most evident in our workplaces.…</span>

Title: What Does Putin Want?
Subtitle: The Russian autocrat is not crazy, war is simply a necessity for his power and economic system

 Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin outlined five goals for his war: Ukraine’s non-alignment with NATO; a change in Ukraine’s government; a severe limitation of Ukraine’s defence capacity; the seizure of Ukrainian territory (with international recognition); and the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia. 
 In the first weeks of the war, Putin also had a maximalist agenda: the quick occupatio…</span>

                              <span>I was diagnosed with lupus a few years ago. My mom also had it and passed away after 10 years due to complications. My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job.
I did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn’t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation.
Previously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free.
I also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn’t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I’ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation.
I hope this helps, though it’s just my personal experience.</span>

In other words: If you&#x27;re trying to improve your security posture, installing an ad-blocker is one of the best things you can do. If you have less tech-savvy friends and relatives, I would strongly recommend setting up uBlock Origin for them.</span>

It has the accuracy/time trade-off you&#x27;re interested in, but the implementation is quite different. It samples random points on the disk and finds out what file path they belong to. The longer it runs the more accurate it gets. The readme is good at explaining why this approach makes sense for btrfs and what its limitations are.

                              <span>Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.</span>

                              <span>I tried zed for a few weeks because I&#x27;m generally sympathetic to the &quot;use a native app&quot; idea vs Electron. I generally liked it and its UX but:
1. VSCode is pretty damn fast to be honest. Very rarely is my slowdown in my work VSCode loading. Maybe I don&#x27;t open very large files? Probably 5k lines of typescript at most.
2. Integration with the Typescript language server was just not as good as VSCode. I can&#x27;t pin down exactly what was wrong but the autocompletions in particular felt much worse. I&#x27;ve never worked on a language server or editor so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s on zed/VSCode and what&#x27;s on the TS language server.
Eventually all the little inconveniences wore on me and I switched back to VSCode.
I will probably try it again after a few more releases to see if it feels better.</span>

                              <span>Entertaining, but I think the conclusion is way off.
&gt; their vision is, at best, like that of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry
is a crazy thing to write in an abstract. Did they try to probe that hypothesis at all? I could (well actually I can&#x27;t) share some examples from my job of GPT-4v doing some pretty difficult fine-grained visual tasks that invalidate this.
Personally, I rate this paper [1], which makes the argument that these huge GenAI models are pretty good at things - assuming that it has seen a LOT of that type of data during training (which is true of a great many things). If you make up tasks like this, then yes can be REALLY bad at them, and initial impressions of AGI get harder to justify. But in practice, we aren&#x27;t just making up tasks to trip up these models. They can be very performant on some tasks and the authors have not presented any real evidence about these two modes.

                              <span>I’d argue that a factor in CUDA’s success is their army of in-house researchers which use CUDA to do novel things. Sometimes those things get turned into products (OptiX) other times they are essentially DevRel to show off what the hardware can do and documentation for how to do it. Additionally I’m sure they use pre-release hardware and software and give feedback about how to improve it.
I don’t know what AMD has in mind for this acquisition but I could see there being a lot of value having an in house LLM team to create models for customers to build on, run in benchmarks, and improve their products.</span>

                              <span>All: if you&#x27;re going to post on a topic like this please make sure you&#x27;re not just commenting out of reflexive activation. That&#x27;s not what HN is for, as the site guidelines try to make clear: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.
On HN, we want comments that are thoughtful—i.e. that come from reflection, not reflex [1]; and specific—i.e. that have to do with what&#x27;s different about a story, not what&#x27;s generic. This is not particular to any topic; it&#x27;s an optimization problem: we&#x27;re trying to optimize the site for intellectual curiosity [2].
The trouble with reflexive comments is that they repeat responses that have already happened many times—rather as if they&#x27;re being served from cache [3]. The trouble with generic comments is that the generic level is too abstract to say anything new or interesting. Put those together and you get repetition, the arch-enemy of curiosity [4].

[3] This, btw, is why such comments always show up quickly: cached responses are the fastest to arise. The kind of thoughtful comments we&#x27;re looking for take longer to &quot;compute&quot;.

So first and foremost, could you give us and the readers an update? Last many of us heard, one of you was released.
 So for those who don’t already know about our case and a small update: 
 On November 3, 2022 we four comrades were arrested, accused of the arson attack to the meat company Susaron, a national industry that has been supplying the whole country with beef, pork and poultry meat for years. 
 On November 4, we were remanded in custody for the duration of the investigation. Accused of burning six trucks, t…</span>

 By &quot;Anjin&quot; is meant here spiritual calmness created by Prajna. Prajna is a unique intuition that sees the true nature of things as they are (Yathabhutam). &quot;Zazen-shin&quot; (坐 禅 箴, Instruction in Zazen) by Dogen (1200 -1253) reads: &quot;A bird flies as a bird does; a fish swims likes a fish!&quot; The essence of things seen by Prajna or Yathatathyadarsana (如 実 見, seeing into the truth as it is) is named &quot;Suchness&quot; (tathata) or &quot;Emptiness&quot; (sunyata), because it is beyond our daily expression which is the result of discriminative consciousness …</span>

Title: Some Zapatista Principles &amp; Practices...
Date: 2009
Source: Scanned from “Sharing Leadership Series Handout 5.6.09”

 The Zapatista indigenous movement in Chiapas, México has summarized many of their principles into short, accessible sayings that convey big ideas about a different way of leading and building power, which contrast greatly with repressive/oppressive methods of holding power and authority. 
Mandar Obedeciendo (Lead by Obeying)
 PRINCIPLE: True leaders follow the will of the people, the desires of the larger community. 
 PRACTICE: This principle challenges authoritarianism in the communities, and representatives who are not accountable to the widespread desires of the community will be ousted from their positions. In many of the communities, an oversig…</span>

If your trading is not dropped into one of these buckets, you are probably going to struggle. Month after month, the money is made within these buckets. If you spend most of your time outside of these buckets, you probably aren&#x27;t making much progress, getting lucky, or you have some structural edge such as a large following, a broker that provides you with the midpoint or better on the majority of your fills, or some dumbass CFD &quot;broker&quot; that allows you to hit the bid on stocks on SSR with unlimited size without impacting the market...
This is where the money is being made, this is where the focus ought to be. If you think you can reinvent the wheel or feel the need to do so, you are wasting your time.

I started writing about Going Infinite about the highly autistic Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, FTX and its downfall. However, I couldn&#x27;t do it justice. I recommend picking up the book and reading it for yourself. FWIW, after reading it, your pov should remain the same of &quot;crypto is highly retarded&quot;.
Instead of going down that rabbit hole, I decided to go for a feel-good post with a little update since deciding to step away from my former profession...
Okay, so I left on April 3rd, 2024 so it&#x27;s been a total of 97 days and during that time I have:

When the real Internet, the kind you access through a browser, or rather through Netscape 1.0, became available, for me in 1996, most of us had 14.4 modems; we quickly upgraded to 28.8 and then 56.6 bps. When things were still super slow, I remember downloading Netscape 2.0 like it was the birth of another child.

i am absolutely exploding inside with this news, but i have no way to scream it, so this will have to do.
we&#x27;ve put an offer in on a house on sunday, and they accepted it today! i cannot believe it! i cried all the two hours it took for us to get home; partially because this is a dream that i have worked so hard for and never thought i&#x27;d actually get.
the house is deeply within our budget, thank goodness; but it&#x27;s pushing the limits of commute for my boyfriend, which is unfortunate. i wish it was still affordable to live within reasonable commuting distance of a major city like seattle, but i&#x27;m just so thankful that we&#x27;re staying in the pacific northwest. i&#x27;m really loving every second of being here, and it feels as though i was always meant to be here in this moment—i…</span>

 A couple weeks ago, I was talking to my friends who run the podcast It Could Happen Here. “Summer is coming, and an awful lot of people are newly radicalized. You all should put out an episode about what the next steps are,” I told them. 
 “Perfect,” someone replied. “Write it and record it by May 20th.” 
 So I wrote a short and incomplete guide for new activists. You can hear me present it in audio format if you’d like. 
 I’m coming with my own biases which I want to get out right up front: I’m an anarchist, and it’s also been decades since I broke into the movement, beca…</span>

 A short poem “Adoring Naivety” by a Christian poet Jukichi Yagi (1827–1927) runs as follows: 
 Rice bread, 
 Whole-rice bread, 
 Fresh and steaming! 
 Whole-rice bread! 
 A bread seller goes about a “Non-acting” (Mu-i 無 爲 akarma) path singing cries of wares, as if in ecstacy over his singing.[1]
 This verse seems to suggest the aesthetic character of the Japanese folks. In the early days, Japanese peddlers, such as gold-fish vendors, beancurd dealers and seedling-peddlers used to peddle by crying in rythmical voices. Mood, relish, flavour and atmosphere carry great weight in a Japanese life. “Japanese ph…</span>

Instead of a Prologue
 About the subject of “Individuality and the anarchist group”, one could say that it’s a timeless issue within the anarchist milieu… Is an anarchist individuality subjugated or liberated within a group? How does the individual encounter the collective? Can disagreements between comrades of the same collective be creative or do they inevitably lead to disputes, rivalries, intrigues, competitions and end up in rupture? 
 How are friendships and cliques able to bring about a cancellation of an anarchist group? 
 What is the relationship of an anarchist organization to the expulsions…</span>

Title: What Is Mutualism?
Date: 1927
Notes: This is a very interesting and valuable text on Mutualism. It is slightly dated in some points and a bit off the target when dealing with monetary matters. Nevertheless it remains a powerful exposition of the main tenets of Mutualism and a sincere plea in favour of the freedom and autonomy of the individual.

                              <span>&gt; Indeed, last year GitHub was said to have tuned its programming assistant to generate slight variations of ingested training code to prevent its output from being accused of being an exact copy of licensed software.
If I, a human, were to:
1. Carefully read and memorize some copyrighted code.
2. Produce new code that is textually identical to that. But in the process of typing it up, I randomly mechanically tweak a few identifiers or something to produce code that has the exact same semantics but isn&#x27;t character-wise identical.
3. Claim that as new original code without the original copyright.
I assume that I would get my ass kicked legally speaking. That reads to me exactly like deliberate copyright infringement with willful obfuscation of my infringement.
How is it any different when a machine does the same thing?</span>

&gt; There’ll be plots of various stats, including CPU utilization. I think meet will also helpfully suggest closing tabs if your machine is overloaded
This is not mundane at all, it&#x27;s a perfect example of giving your product an unfair competitive advantage.
If Meet users are told why their meeting isn&#x27;t working correctly but Zoom, Teams and Slack, Meet users are going to have a better experience that Zoom, Teams or Slack has no way of replicating.
No wonder every other meeting provider pushes you aggressively into using their desktop app, Google Meet&#x27;s desktop app is just Chrome!</span>

                              <span>The way this works (and I&#x27;m obviously taking a high level view here) is by comparing what is being played to what is being captured. There is an inherent latency in between what is called the capture stream (the mic) and the reverse stream (what is being output to the speakers, be it people taking or music or whatever), and by finding this latency and comparing, one can cancel the music from the speech captured.
Within a single process, or tree of processes that can cooperate, this is straightforward (modulo the actual audio signal processing which isn&#x27;t) to do: keep what you&#x27;re playing for a few hundreds milliseconds around, compare to what you&#x27;re getting in the microphone, find correlations, cancel.
If the process aren&#x27;t related there are multiple ways to do this. Either the OS provides a capture API that does the cancellation, this is what happens e.g. on macOS for Firefox and Safari, you can use this. The OS knows what is being output. This is often available on mobile as well.
Sometimes (Linux desktop, Windows) the OS provides a loopback stream: a way to capture the audio that is being played back, and that can similarly be used for cancellation.
If none of this is available, you mix the audio output and perform cancellation yourself, and the behaviour your observe happens.
Source: I do that, but at Mozilla and we unsurprisingly have the same problems and solutions.</span>

Maybe the company providing the service because those people experiencing the slow connection might never buy again. You&#x27;re probably a also costing stripe for their upload bandwidth.
And here I am, avoiding downloading things on cell service because it might negatively impact other people around me.</span>

                              <span>Decades ago, my partner used Google Voice for texting -- really handy, texts just showed up in the gmail inbox, and could be replied to from there. She didn&#x27;t like cellphones, but usually carried one of the old &quot;Kindle Keyboard&quot; models with unlimited 3G data. The Kindle had simple web browser that could load the low-spec gmail interface, so in essence she had a fully functional SMS device, with no monthly charges.
Notification of incoming texts was the only problem. I jailbroke the thing and started trying to schedule network requests, thinking I&#x27;d add some kind of new message counter on the home screen. This proved hard. But it occurred to me that the best place for the counter would be right next to the Kindle&#x27;s device name, at the top of the screen. And the device name could be updated from her Amazon account.
So I automated a web browser on the home server to log into Amazon and update the device name to &quot;My Kindle (x)&quot; where x was the number of unread Google Voice texts. The Kindle would update the name on the home screen in less than a minute. This worked for years!
(Eventually that Kindle was stolen. I wanted to update its name to something foul but the device disappeared from her account too quickly.)</span>

                              <span>A non-stressful day at work is hard to come by. I am constantly straddling the fine line between being burnt out, and just flipping a table and walking away. At the end of the day, those two feelings are basically the same side of a coin.
I work remotely full-time, for the most part. Sometimes I travel for workshops, but that’s mostly just at the beginning of kicking off a new product that I’ve been asked to build. Any other time, I’m mostly working in my home office, which has become my favorite place in the house, yet the place where I stress out the most.
I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I’m in meetings probably 5-6 hours a day. With a majority of my current team in Central and Eastern time zones (2-3 hours ahead of me), sometimes I also forget to take a break and eat. It’s easy to lose track of time when I’m focused on solving this problem or that.
I also forget to breathe.
The weather finally cooled down yesterday, and a little bit today before we hit another heat wave. LSC constantly encourages me, and at times pushes me to go for a walk. Take a walk around the block, and just breathe. We practice breathing together, inhaling and exhaling. Inhale the fresh air slowly, keep it in for a few seconds, exhale slowly. Then we go back in the house, and I feel a tiny bit better.
Sometimes we get into what we’re doing so deeply that we forget the essentials. We forget to breathe. We don’t notice it until we’re drowning, and it’s even harder to get back to the surface. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder to stop what you’re doing, take a walk if you can, and breathe.
So hey, let this be a reminder.
Go for a walk. Inhale that fresh air. Hold it in. Exhale.

i’ve finally started a new job after my month-long vacation in europe. i’m still working in design, which is still not really my ideal (even if my high-school self was convinced it was)1. either way, it’s fun and i like it better than my previous one.
my last job was 100% remote. (they were changing this policy just as i was leaving though). i enjoyed having so much free time, of course. the commute in the philippines eats away up to 4 hours of your day, if you’re lucky. that’s not including time you spend getting ready, or time spent s…</span>

                              <span>During National Camera Day , I wrote about my non-exhaustive list of cameras I’ve owned. A lot of great discussions came out of this, both via Mastodon and email. One of those things is in regard to my post-processing workflow.

As you can see in my respose to Lou, I currently do very little when it comes to post-processing photos. It wasn’t always like this, but I think that’s a story for another post. This one will focus specifically on what I do now (which isn’t much).
Both of my primary cameras (Fujifilm X100V and Ricoh GRIIIx) have some sort of film simulation that I can set up in-camera and I rely on that to do a majority of my edits.
In my Fujifilm X100V, I primarily use the Reggie’s Portra film sim

Title: Primitive anarchy and the anti-alphabet
Date: Summer 2024
Source: Plastic in Utero issue #3

 The way I see it, primitive anarchy is a total challenge to the pacified social field. This means that it is multi-faceted and at once constructive and destructive.
