                              <span>IMHO &quot;every day&quot; is far too frequent, and this ADHD-ish attitude is one of the reasons why the quality of average software has gone down the drain. Developers need to step back, think more deeply, and not worry about being pressured into &quot;shipping code&quot; that barely works.
The dopamine rush of your code being shipped
This frequent overstimulation leads to less ability for long-term attention. When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.
Your team (and manager) sees you&#x27;re working
Tough problems need time to solve, and you won&#x27;t see much meanwhile. If needing to put on a show for others is more important than actually working, something is very wrong.
Your git commit streak looks good
Yes, people say this doesn&#x27;t matter. But I&#x27;m sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn&#x27;t a great look.
Optimising for metrics never works for those who can see through the illusion, and that&#x27;s an increasing number of people over time. If I was a recruiter and saw that sort of activity, I wouldn&#x27;t think of it as more than someone just putting on a show --- especially if the majority of those commits are effectively &quot;thrashing&quot; or &quot;churning&quot;.
The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done
I can personally say that the satisfaction is far bigger the longer you&#x27;ve persevered.</span>

IMO they should do a better job of referencing existing papers and techniques. The way they wrote about &quot;adaptors&quot; can make it seem like it&#x27;s something novel, but it&#x27;s actually just re-iterating vanilla LoRA. It was enough to convince one of the top-voted HackerNews comments that this was a &quot;huge development&quot;.
Benchmarks are nice though.</span>

Don&#x27;t believe me go to Europe and Japan where kids are still allowed to walk and bike to school, to friends places and just in general play and exist outside unattended to a much higher degree than in the US. Because in the US they would be roadkill, and even if they somehow survived outside of a car, car centric design means there&#x27;s nowhere for them to go on foot or by bike anyway.

I think this is exactly what _most_ people want.
With password management specifically, Apple has had a Chrome extension available for a while now which has allowed me to use it on other browsers/platforms. Not ideal, but good enough for most.
On top of that, they don&#x27;t lock you in with passwords. You can easily import and export your passwords, just like you can with 1Password.
Apple Music has had a web client for a long time. iTunes has been on Windows for 20+ years and Apple Music was supported via that until recently when they built an Apple Music specific app.</span>

                              <span>Here&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s big problem: it&#x27;s not a replacement for so many alternatives because it isn&#x27;t supported on all platforms.
Safari? Not on Windows.
Apple Music? This actually has a Windows client. I&#x27;m not sure how good it is. But Spotify supports Windows and even Linux.
Apple Password Manager? Will this be tied to iCloud? Will I be able to use it on Android? If I no longer have an iPhone will it be a pain to maintain and use?
A dog cannot serve two masters. A company like Apple doesn&#x27;t see any of these things as a product. They&#x27;re a means to an end: to push the iPhone platform (and hardware sales). That priority will always trump the interests of a product like this.
It&#x27;s also why I refuse to buy more into Google products: it&#x27;s too much of a risk to lose access to everything if Google wakes up one day and decides to suspend your account with no recourse other than making enough of a stink on social media such that an employee will actually look into it.

It&#x27;s the benefit of how Apple does product ownership. In contrast to Google and Microsoft.
I hadn&#x27;t considered it, but AI convergence is going to lay bare organizational deficiencies in a way previous revolutions didn&#x27;t.
Nobody wants a GenAI feature that works in Gmail, a different one that works in Messages, etc. -- they want a platform capability that works anywhere they use text.
I&#x27;m not sure either Google or Microsoft are organizationally-capable of delivering that, at this point.</span>

Apple clearly thinks it needs a dedicated LLM service atm. But still thinks it is only supplemental as they handle a bunch of the core stuff without it. And require explicit user consent to use OpenAI. And Apple clearly views it as a partial commodity since they even said they plan to add others.
Tough to bet against OpenAI right now...but this deal does not feel like a 10 year deal...</span>

                              <span>Have to say, I was thoroughly  impressed by what Apple showed today with all this Personal AI stuff. And it proves that the real power of consumer AI will be in the hands of the platform owners where you have most of your digital life in already (Apple or Google for messaging, mail, photos, apps; Microsoft for work and/or life).
The way Siri can now perform actions based on context from emails and messages like setting calendar and reservations or asking about someone’s flight is so useful (can’t tell you how many times my brother didn’t bother to check the flight code I sent him via message when he asks me when I’m landing for pickup!).
I always saw this level of personal intelligence to come about at some point, but I didn’t expect Apple to hit it out of the park so strongly. Benefit of drawing people into their ecosystem.
Nevermind all the thought put into private cloud, integration with ChatGPT, the image generation playground, and Genmoji.  I can genuinely see all this being useful for “the rest of us,” to quote Craig. As someone who’s taken a pessimistic view of Apple software innovation the last several years, I’m amazed.
One caveat: the image generation of real people was super uncanny and made me uncomfortable. I would not be happy to receive one of those cold and impersonal, low-effort images as a birthday wish.</span>

                              <span>I parent a child with autism. The care needs are intense; the burnout is real. But I can&#x27;t employ usual burnout mitigation techniques like taking time off or making career / lifestyle changes. The world relentlessly marches forward. However, I&#x27;ve learned human resilience is AMAZING. You&#x27;ll be surprised at what you are capable of when life asks for it.
Here are a few big insights that have really helped me:
- You never have to feel like doing something to start doing it. This insight is so strangely freeing. It really got me out of my head and the loop that I was in berating myself about motivation.
- The act of doing something is usually what creates motivation to continue. Tell yourself you&#x27;ll spend 30 minutes on whatever it is. No matter what it is, I always know I can survive 30 minutes of it. However, 90% of the time, the timer goes off, but I don&#x27;t feel like stopping. I&#x27;ve found my grove and I keep going.
- Procrastination isn&#x27;t poor time management; it&#x27;s poor emotional management. Be gentle with yourself. Know that you can be scared, frustrated, or angry but don&#x27;t have to let those emotions define you. CBT works really well here. Don&#x27;t define emotions as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Define them as &quot;useful&quot;. If the emotion you feel isn&#x27;t useful, acknowledge it, but realize it&#x27;s fleeting and let it pass on. Some people like to visualize emotions as clouds drifting by.
&quot;And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.&quot;

Disconnected from social media, but will always answer an email.
My retreat from social media was gradual and uneventful. I left Facebook so long ago that I barely remember what I used it for. I left Instagram well before it became the weird jumble of videos, shorts and occasionally photos it is today. People trying to be brands, brands posing as people. Twitter broke my heart - it connected me to many cool people, helped me find an audience as a musician, and led to lifelong friendships. And then it all went to shit - though honestly, it had been going to shit for a while.
It was a clean break. For the most part, I haven’t missed social media. I’ve kept in touch with friends in other ways, from the ubiquitous…</span>

                              <span>sunday morning, june 9th, 2024
i woke up and cried.
i had a dream of my grandfather for the first time in a long, long time.
he died in 2011 after a painful battle with pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. by the end of it all, he told my mom he was tired and that he wanted to rest.
in my dream, i was seated at the breakfast nook, looking through my laptop. i had a messaging app open and i was texting my grandfather. he was dead in the dream and i was talking to him in the afterlife.
i told him about how i was birdwatching now—how his little granddaughter who hated the sun and the soil now goes to forests and rivers and hikes mountains, despite her fear of bugs.
i sent him an aerial view of a plane ride. my college graduation. my friends, who i’ve all met after his passing. i told him my cousins were in college now. i said i missed him over and over again.
i can’t remember his responses. all i remember was him saying he missed me too.
it was the first time i wasn’t a child in my dream. i was myself, all 23 and some of me.
it was the first time he was dead in my dream—that he wasn’t wearing his trademark red polo and tan slacks.
there’s something bittersweet about that. i think i prefer the dreams where he’s still alive and i am still a child, clinging to the hem of his pants and telling him where to find the parking lot in my favourite mall (he knows the way so much better than i do, but he still follows my lead).
it’s been 13 years since his death. i’ve moved on, mostly. but there is a hole in my heart in the shape of our secret dates to fast food restaurants; a hole in the shape of a grandfather who adored me enough to take a drive over an hour across the city just because i missed him. it’s a hole only a grandfather can fill.
it will stay empty for the rest of my life.

                              <span>As you certainly will not know, I have been writing blogs for almost ten years. Do I have any proof of this? I do not. For I have deleted them all. Why?, I hear you not ask, well I never felt comfortable with the name, the platform, you name it. All I wanted to do was write but I found myself instead worrying about being judged, rejected, subscriber numbers, aesthetics, and the time it took to load a page on Wordpress.
shudders
I began, like most of us, on Wordpress. After growing disillusioned with it and the years it took to rectify margins, I transitioned to Medium. Medium promised me the world, money and followers. It encouraged me to write often and with hooks. It spat out posts by writer claiming they made their first million on Medium.
It was the worst writing of my life.

                              <span>It&#x27;s half past eleven. I finished teaching an hour and a half ago and have been trying to fall asleep ever since. Everyone&#x27;s telling me I need to rest for my first day at work, and I know I should too! I&#x27;m not nervous, but I do have what you might call the first day jitters, and they&#x27;re doing a great job of keeping me up.
These sleep problems are a recent occurrence. In college I could have napped on death row. I can only remember one sleepless night from my childhood: when I was fourteen or fifteen I could not for the life of me fall asleep the night before taking the SAT. I remember going to the master bedroom room at 4 in the morning and telling Mom and Dad I couldn&#x27;t sleep and I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen them so worried. Mom told me to listen to some music so I put on Glenn Goul…</span>

On the other hand, I don’t think advertising the fact that the company introduced a major bug from copy and pasting ChatGPT code around and that they spent a week being unable to even debug why it was failing.
I don’t know much about this startup, but this blog post had the opposite effect of all of the other high quality post-mortem posts I’ve read lately. Normally the goal of these posts is to demonstrate your team’s rigor and engineering skills, not reveal that ChatGPT is writing your code and your engineers can’t/won’t debug it for a very long time despite knowing that it’s costing them signups.</span>

That&#x27;s the magic number. There have to be four competitors of significant size before prices go down. There are both EU and US studies substantiating this.
It&#x27;s been seen in cellular phone networks, ISPs, drugstores, and banks. Drop below the threshold of four, and the magic happens. Prices go up, margins go up, and consumers lose.
Four should be the basis of antitrust policy. Less than four, and there are two options - break up, or become a regulated public utility.
Two or three isn&#x27;t enough. Collusion happens. Explicitly or implicitly, price competition doesn&#x27;t happen with only two or three players.
Four seems to be enough that cartels usually break up on their own. Somebody won&#x27;t play ball.

It&#x27;s the equivalent of a president signing a bill and then attempting to post-facto veto it.
It&#x27;s been very frustrating to see so little news (both local and national) pick up on this basic reality: Hochul is acting far beyond her constitutional powers as the governor, and the legislative branch has so far responded only tepidly (by refusing to pass her last-minute tax alternative).</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s definitely been a move to demand individuals be good at everything... old stereotypes of the nerd brought a lot of negatives, but they were also apologetic, acknowledging the trade off, that paying attention deeply to one thing does lead to being worse at other things.
The exact stereotype differed by domain... the performer who is a diva, the self destructive author, the manic artist... each with a hint of nobility but also quite off-putting.
The author wanting to combine Weird Nerd with autistic is very incorrect IMHO... I&#x27;ve known a lot of weird nerds, am one myself, and there&#x27;s lots of different flavors, most of them not autistic.
So much of talent is just really caring about something specific. Caring about it above other things. Specifically above external motivation and incentives. Do that and the weirdness grows naturally, neurodivergence isn&#x27;t even necessary (though it might help)</span>

 JANUARY – OCTOBER – THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES 
 To my friends, brothers and sisters, comrades
I remember that last day as if it were yesterday, when !finally! I left (was expelled from) the cold,narrow aseptic cell of the maximum security prison of Aachen, Germany… On January 16 (2013) I was escorted to the airport of Barajas, Madrid, by Interpol, and from there I was taken to the tribunal of Plaza Castilla, not before being photographed (they were particularly interested in my chest as they looked in vain to find a tattoo of the acronym FAI/FRI), ‘playing the piano’ (had my fingerprints taken) in order to ascertain that it was …</span>

The following interview with self-described primal anarchist advocate, writer, editor, independent researcher, publisher, musician and rewilding human, Kevin Tucker, originally appeared in the first issue of the new Indonesian anarchist journal, Jurnal Anarki. Jurnal Anarki is written entirely in Bahasa Indonesian, and this is the first time content from it has been republished in English. We’d like to thank comrade Eat for making this possible!

 Comrades!
Today I’m in high spirits (you know our life is not a straight line, nor constant, or static…), and those who know me personally know that I have a pretty black a sense of humour (what ‘scandalizes’ others makes me smile, etc.) almost cynically (especially when it comes to talking about/describing facts to do with the ‘Law’, ‘Rights’, the ‘Authorities’, etc.); because these are ‘things’ that I can’t take seriously (even though my life is wrapped up in all tha…</span>

 ‘Anarchist prisoners are not alone’ and ‘if they touch one, they touch all’ are slogans that lived once again in the everyday anarchist action before, during and after the trial against us. The screams of disgust for authority that pierced the police control and the walls around those on trial clearly enraged the judge and magistrates, as was evident on their faces and which put smiles on ours. The presence in court of dear ones known and unknown filled us with pride and joy, preventing the prosecutors’ accusations and demands from having any possibility of intimidating us. T…</span>

(Italy, Mexico, Greece)
 On Wednesday, June 13th, the international anti-anarchist campaign under the name ‘operation boldness’ was set up. The Italian antiterrorism forces of ROS and carabiniers were put under the command of the Inquisitor-prosecutor of Perugia Manuela Comodi, and proceeded to arrest eight anarchist comrades. In parallel, investigations are conducted against other comrades as well (among them are the comrades of Edizioni Cerbero).

Prison dirties creases and swallows pieces of dreams, desires, thoughts and feelings. Its most permanent residents, the majority of the prisoners are now a part of the appliances of the prison. Bars, yard, cameras, locks, prisoners mix all together and re-enact the world of captivity. Nothing is worthy in here. Come let’s go and don’t look back… Only fire will cleanse this place… ”

 On March 3rd, “justice” decided on the pre-trial detention of the mother of the comrades Christos and Gerasimos Tsakalos and the second one’s girlfriend, with the charge of accession and participation in a terrorist organization.
 Behind the obvious ridiculousness of the charge, it is the morbid vindictiveness of the counter-terrorism and the judicial authority hiding, which wishes to blackmail emotionally both the two comrades and all of us. It is not ju…</span>

A flame of solidarity from the CCF for the brothers and sisters in Chile (2011)
When the prison bars stop our hands from throwing the fire of anarchy into the world of power, our words become the sharp rasp of escape.

 The past 24 hours find us in an extreme emotional antithesis… 
 On the one hand, great sorrow for the death of the 15-year old Afghani and the injury of his sister and on the other hand, maximum rage for the reportages of the media which totally arbitrarily and purposefully try to involve our organisation in this event. We are not usually “bothered” by the panic-ridden scenaria of the media, yet the importance of the event forces us to take a public position directly, without a connection to any attack of ours.

 The fact that we are captives in the prison cells of democracy does not mean that we accept for a moment our position either as prisoners or as defendants before the civil court-martial that you have set up against us.

It is sometimes useful to keep a distance from events before you talk about them. Anticipation and the frozen time of captivity in prison accelerate, nevertheless, the cool-headed distance from events. A self-possessed distance gives you the opportunity to observe details which are usually ignored and bulldozed by the warm blood conditions’ momentum of intensity. So, as they often say, “the devil is hidden in the details”…

 It’s been already 25 days that the mother of Christos and Gerasimos Tsakalos and the girlfriend of the second one are locked up in the cells of democracy. 
 We have already been for 25 days on hunger strike until death, demanding their immediate release. 
 It’s been 25 days and already eight of us are in hospitals with their health condition on the limits. 
 25 days are not just a number on a calendar, it is the experiment of evolution of repression, with new methods of emotional blackmail against imprisoned anarchist urban guerrillas.

 In the incidents of the 5th May concerning the fire in the Marfin Bank there were three dead bank employees and thousands of “charred” truths. The suffocating atmosphere of the heartbreaking hypocrisy of propaganda and the worn moralistic humanism of the radical movement’s Cassandras, force us to take a public stand concerning these events. This does not mean that we are talking as “specialists” of violence, or that we are “self-appointed” prosecutors or defenders of the people who attacked the bank building.

Hundreds of banks, shops, car dealers, offices,… were attacked, plundered and put on fire.

General Introduction
 This is the political program of our organization, Black Rose Anarchist Federation / Federación Anarquista Rosa Negra (BRRN). The writings it contains are the result of nearly two years of collective analysis, discussion, and debate. The content of the program is divided into three parts: sections that detail our understanding of the social, political,…</span>

                              <span>Minutes before I left home on Thursday one of my mom&#x27;s coworkers pulled up on the driveway and handed me a plastic bag of zongzi as a going away gift. &quot;Good luck with the move!&quot; he said. &quot;Go do what you love.&quot;
That last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom&#x27;s framed this new career shift of mine.
A large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn&#x27;t want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why&#x27;s she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I&#x27;m not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?
In Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that &quot;looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.&quot; I&#x27;ve been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I&#x27;m not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I&#x27;m nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I&#x27;m doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.</span>

                              <span>I have been preparing for job interviews (looking to get into genai+backend roles you know). I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…</span>

You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet. That should be a commonplace idea. And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.
It can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits. But how transformative are such programs?

Since 1897, Zionism has been the religious and political impetus behind what is now the nation-state of Israel, which, like the United States, is settled on the lives, land, and cultures of millions of Indigenous peoples. Although today’s Israel began as a refuge for European Jews fleeing the Holocaust, Zionism long ago broke out of its moral constraints to become a formidable geopolitical force that demands study. Which is why, in late 2023 America, the Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism was created. And why, because the Institute is fundamentally antizionist, it’s under attack for antisemitism.

Can&#x27;t read that and not get curious, excited, for the future.
Congratulations to all those involved in the research and thanks to all who contributed to it - including all taxpayers if public funding was given, even indirectly (i.e. in the schooling and education, grants, for said researchers)</span>

                              <span>Getting my models dunked on by people who can&#x27;t open MS Outlook more than 3 tries out of 5, however, have a remarkable depth and insight into their chosen domain of expertise. It&#x27;s rather humbling.
Collaborating with nontechnical people is oddly my favorite part of doing MLE work right now. It wasn&#x27;t the case when I did basic web/db stuff. They see me as a magician. I see them as voodoo priests and priestesses. When we get something trained up and forecasting that we both like, it&#x27;s super fulfilling. I think for both sides.
Most of my modeling is healthcare related. I tease insights out of a monstrous data lake of claims, Rx, doctor notes, vital signs, diagnostic imagery, etc. What is also monstrous is how accessible this information is. HIPAA my left foot.
Since you seemed to be asking about the temporal realities, it&#x27;s about 3 hours of meetings a week, probably another 3 doing task grooming/preparatory stuff, fixing some ETL problem, or doing a one-off query for the business, the rest is swimming around in the data trying to find a slight edge to forecast something that surprised us for a $million or two using our historical snapshots. It&#x27;s like playing wheres waldo with math. And the waldo scene ends up being about 50TB or so in size. :D</span>

                              <span>Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I&#x27;m not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there&#x27;s just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It&#x27;s an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

You made it through the day. I&#x27;m proud of you. Seriously, I&#x27;m so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look forward to anything when you&#x27;re feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you&#x27;ll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll feel better. Someday I&#x27;ll be alright.&quot; Remember, that &quot;someday&quot; comes one day at a time, and you&#x27;ll get there. You will.
I&#x27;m proud of you. I&#x27;m very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

                              <span>Whoops, they did it again. Only this time it was no “tragic mistake.” There were no apologies. Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.

For context:
The governments of the world provides these big weather companies (weather.com (cough IBM), Accuweather (cough IBM cough), etc) a metric shit ton of their data completely for free (by law) including data transfer. These are things like radar, satellite, ground station data, forecasts, composite models, etc. These companies profit substantially on it, as in billions of dollars. You as citizens also can get this data completely for free as well! MADIS is a system the government is working on to make that data access easier by bringing together many of these systems together and removing the bureaucratic redundancy and abstracting out the aging infrastr…</span>

                              <span>I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It&#x27;s so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels &quot;less serious&quot;.
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don&#x27;t worry so much about what people think of me. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I&#x27;ve come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can&#x27;t please them all – and that&#x27;s fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It&#x27;s more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

                              <span>Since the launch of ChatGPT back in 2022 AI has explod — just kidding. Those lead-ins are getting tiring, right?
But what has become even more irritating is how everything is &quot;AI-powered&quot; all of a sudden.
Let me make it clear up-front that I am not opposed to using AI, whatever that means anymore, for a product. I&#x27;ve done it myself and it&#x27;s a good way to add value to the product, if it really needs it.
But what truly irks me are the common-day apps which have been just fine without such AI plug-ins and, all of a sudden, they become &quot;AI-powered&quot;. Here are a few things that go through my head when &quot;AI-powered&quot; is advertised up-front:
How reliable are the outputs / are hallucinations present?
Where does my data go? (Probably OpenAI, but not 100% sure)
Is the AI-powered going to be a mark-up?

She has the face of a model and long, shimmering black hair. She was wearing a sleek black dress. She tried to maintain her composure as Israeli police swarmed around her. There is a look of confusion and then a flash of fear on her face as she is told she’s being arrested.  More

                              <span>The neoliberal attack on government expenditure in poorer countries was a key driver of international migration. Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy. More

But I am pointing out that while New York State court has jurisdiction over convicted felon Trump, the judge has both the right and the obligation—before issuing a sentence—to find out if the defendant has understood the charges that were brought against him. (From his endless press conferences during his trials, Trump sounds clueless about the facts in his own cases.) More

                              <span>The whole phony case against Assange stinks of corruption and abuse of power. Corruption because the CIA under Mike “Get Assange” Pompeo plotted to kidnap or murder the journalist and also, corruptly, listened in on his privileged conversations with his attorney in the Ecuadoran embassy. Corruption because bogus charges were cooked up against him by a pliant Swedish prosecutor, the sole purpose of which was to toss Assange into the clutches of the furious U.S. government. Assange did not rape those two women in Sweden, and the prosecutor eventually dropped the case. But the damage was done: to Assange’s reputation and to his freedom, because once he sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy, he was trapped. More

                              <span>Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They&#x27;re all pretty great!

                              <span>Ten (10) years ago, on June 6th, 2014, the
first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash
and markdown kicked off the project we have today. Who could have predicted that 10 years later,
Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn&#x27;t just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the
7M+ Developers,
and the even larger user community that have all hel…</span>

                              <span>The point of this blog was to put myself out there. Why? I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don&#x27;t get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!</span>

However, it is only from 2022 onwards that large models (LLM, LAM, and others) are gaining traction and attention worldwide. It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana&#x27;s AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane&#x27;s brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and &quot;pay-to-win&quot; games (which use NFTs).

Going to these appointments is one of the few activities I actually prefer my parents come along. Not because I enjoy their company (it&#x27;s hit or miss), but because I&#x27;m no good at doing the things they usually do. (And by &#x27;they&#x27; I mean my mom.)
Today before I leave for the optometrist Mom tells me I shouldn&#x27;t agree to pay more than $110 for my visit, the same amount we paid last year. Upon arrival, the receptionist informs me that the fee for checkups is $250 now. $250? I thought it was supposed to be $110, I say. She shows me a packet with the price printed in bo…</span>

                              <span>Everything is dependent on feedback loops. Video games/reels have short exciting feedback loops. That is why they are so addictive. Real life often has long feedback loops. Anything you do, it will take time to see the results.
You will have to grind hard at something and for a sufficiently long amount of time to achieve something meaningful. Yet if your brain is trained to enjoy short feedback loops it becomes hard to do something for long without seeing exciting results.
You either train yourself to enjoy long feedback loops or you shorten the loop through regular rewards. Maybe break down the huge task into small chunks.
It is often good to run both a long and short feedback loop on a task. The long loop keeps you aware of the bigger picture so the setbacks don&#x27;t seem as bad. The short loop keeps you on track and gives that constant nudge in the right direction.
You are already in a feedback loop whether you are aware of it or not. Better off being in a feedback loop that helps you grow. One of your own making.</span>
