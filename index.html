                              <span>Today marks my first completed year of writing on Bear. I have started and stopped personal blogs in the past, but I decided that I wanted to stick to one and continue with it throughout. Even though I&#x27;ve gotten quite busy these past few months, I feel like I&#x27;ve stuck it out and have been updating and dropping lore left and right. I set a goal for myself and for this blog that I truly wanted to be dedicated and wanted to make sure that I kept on task and archive my life in little bits and pieces.
When I first created this blog, I challenged myself to write every day for 40 days. I&#x27;m not into religion anymore, but one of the most profound stories I heard when I was a kid was the Temptation of Christ in the desert.

While the nation as a whole has recovered the jobs that were lost during the pandemic recession, many places have not. Indeed, job shortfalls remain in more than a quarter of the country’s metro areas, including many in the New York-Northern New Jersey region. In fact, while employment is well above pre-pandemic levels in Northern New Jersey, jobs have only recently recovered in and around New York City, and most of upstate New York—like much of the Rust Belt—still has not fully recovered and has some of the largest job shortfalls in the country.</span>

Consider a recent comment in response to my complaint about people’s obsession with the Gaza War: I suggest you ask a Palestinian for their views. Maybe he was joking, as from a certain perspective this is an amusing response to my […]

                              <span>The U.S. housing market has had a tumultuous few years. After falling to record lows during the pandemic, the average 30-year mortgage rate rapidly increased in 2022 and 2023 and now hovers near a two-decade high of 7.2 percent. For those that locked in a low mortgage rate prior to 2022, this steep increase has significantly increased the cost of moving, as taking out a mortgage at current rates would potentially increase their monthly housing payment by hundreds or thousands of dollars, even if the amount they borrowed remained unchanged. As shown by Ferreira et al. (2011), this lock-in effect has the potential to reduce geographic mobility and turnover in the housing market and has gained the attention of  Federal Reserve leaders. In this post, we utilize special questions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys to estimate the extent to which mortgage rate lock-in is suppressing U.S. household’s moving plans.</span>

I love it and recommend this system to anyone that wants the vibes of Iron Age Warriors seeking to make great stories. So if this is what you are looking for is just &quot;is it worth it&quot; I would say Yes. Past that I am going to do a review of my favorite and least favorite bits of this system. I also am going to review Wolves the system before Wolves the setting I will do the setting in the future but for now I wanted to talk about this system.
The Good:
Boasting - Wolves did away with traditional levels and moved to a more diegetic method of advancement that still provides a solid framework for players to look at when they question how else to advance. Pure diegetic systems can leave players feeling a bit lost as to what they are expected to do an…</span>

It feels extraordinarily silly to write about that, but I think it matters.
I should&#x27;ve written this yesterday! Whilst feeling the emotions and thinking the thoughts! But alas, I did not.
Part of the reason why I didn’t is the same reason why I’ve never been able to keep a journal, no matter how many of those my mother gifted me when I was a child in an attempt to encourage the habit. (Same goes for a blog, ironically, or at least one that is about myself.)
That reason is that I think in words. Not in the sense of hearing them, not quite in the sense of saying them either, but I think the way I write: the words, sentences, just kind of come to me. I don’t exactly conjure them. But I do almost see them, like you would see a h…</span>

when we went to the temple to visit my taima and taikong1, i looked around again. just on the column that housed my great grandparents was the resting place of what seemed like a young child.
the slot is packed with calico critters and a lone sonny angel, sugary sweet snacks and drinks and a cute candle. in another slot, cigarettes and a can of coke. further down the temple, in slot L-28: baby formula and a bottle, alongside a new pink onesie. the name on the slot is yellowed. the baby has been here a while. two sl…</span>

On April 1, the administration of Pitzer College in Claremont, California, outside of Los Angeles, announced that it would be suspending its student exchange program with the University of Haifa in Israel. The following day, the Dean of Faculty’s Office claimed in a statement that the decision to suspend the program did not “reflect an academic boycott,” but “lack of enrollments for at least five years, exchange imbalance, or curricular overlap.” The statement could have passed for a belated April Fool’s Day joke, seeing as how students and faculty at Pitzer and other schools belonging to the consortium of Claremont Colleges had been demanding their institutions sever ties with the Israeli economy and academia due to the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza, which has killed at least 34,488 Palestinians, including 14,500 children and 8,400 women, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing.

                              <span>hey! i haven&#x27;t posted for a while now. i wanted to talk about more manga but couldn&#x27;t justify making a whole post dedicated to one series. so here is a post where i talk about a couple of them briefly. this one will be less edited and more chaotic than usual so enjoy!
cigarette and cherry

i know i know, the last manga i reviewed also had a smoking theme and was a romance manga. the similarities were actually how i found this one.
it has a simple plot of a student enrolling to a university and trying to find a girlfriend but you slowly get invested in the characters and enjoy their banter. most of the story is centered around a cafe and gives me a sort of friends vibe. i enjoyed my time with it, i think it&#x27;s worth checking out.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been able to watch anything lately like animes, youtube videos, dramas, movies, documentaries etc.
Watching feels just too slow for me. If I read, I can consume the content with my preference of pace. That&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t do with watching. Yes, I can speed up the video most of the time but it is still not enough.
It is not like I read super fast by the way. I&#x27;m a quite average reader in terms of speed. Reading just feels more personal, internalizable and absorbable.
It&#x27;s probably because reading is an active process while watching is a passive process.
The important thing is that I realized this reality within myself and I decided to reduce watching videos. So I&#x27;ve been purposely avoiding watching videos for awhile now. I can say that consuming contents in reading format is much more better.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday during my brother&#x27;s graduation my mom told me that her older brother (my uncle) was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with late stage lung cancer.
I don&#x27;t know exactly when this happened, but I think things haven&#x27;t been good for a while now. My mom and her siblings are intentionally very vague; they haven&#x27;t even told my grandparents. I understand not wanting to spook the parents but don&#x27;t know if I agree. I know I would want to know as soon as possible if my firstborn were on death&#x27;s doorstep.
My uncle&#x27;s been smoking since before I was born, so it&#x27;s not like we couldn&#x27;t have foreseen this coming. But I think my grandpa doing the same without issue well into his eighties lulled us all into a false sense of security. The timing stunned me, not least because we found out at com…</span>

                              <span>all of us strangers, dir. andrew haigh

may has arrived at my doorstep, bringing about a new wave of loneliness that doesn’t scream, but thrums.
twenty-three-almost-twenty-four lonely years.
there’s a deep longing for a partner; someone to share everything with. yes, I can do that with my friends, but there’s a line of intimacy that i can’t quite seem to breach. it’s thin, but sturdy. a reminder that the people in my life right now are platonic.
there are dreams of a figure, never a face, that holds me in my sleep. dreams of the hazy silhouette of a five year old running down the stairs; of a home full of laughter and silly tiles and stained glass. dreams of someone who sits beside me on a hot day, complaining about the heatwave that has southeast asia in a vice grip.
there’s never a face.…</span>

                              <span>The best advice I got in college was from a senior. &quot;Pick the teacher not the course&quot; he told me. This was contrary to the general method. Everyone picked a course based on how lenient the grading was or interest.
I respected the guy so decided to follow his advice. I chose &#x27;Computational Complexity&#x27; as an elective. A subject I had no interest in. The Prof was known for strict grading and the material was supposed to be really tough. It was all theory. No practical coding. On paper it was the worst choice I could have made. It turned out to be the best course I ever took.
In my college you can sit for am elective course for first week or two before committing to it. Kind of like window shopping for knowledge. So I decided to check the course out. I knew nothing about it. Had no interest as well. It quickly changed. The Prof teaching it had a passion that was infectious. He would encourage doubts. If someone asked something silly he would say &quot;ah! it seems trivial on the face of it but reveals deeper complexities&quot; with a happy glint in his eyes. There were no stupid questions in his class. So I chose the teacher not the course. Going with my gut and my seniors advice against all common sense. Only 11 other people in the entire college took the course.
I had the most fun in those classes. Learned so much. Fell in love with formal proof writing. Had my mind blown several times. The extra class hours spend absorbing the material, making my way through new proofs felt effortless.
It taught me a lesson that I always keep in mind. Environment matters. The people you surround yourself with matter. Whether in work or personal life. Anything can become interesting, profound and world changing if done with right people.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m soon traveling to Seattle for work. Surprisingly, I&#x27;m more anxious about this trip than seems reasonable, and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve traveled, nor is it even the first time I&#x27;ve gone to Seattle for work. It&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;m going there. Now that I think about it, I can see how the first time was kind of traumatizing in some ways. Perhaps talking about it would help me work through it.
Let&#x27;s start from the beginning...
Last time I went, I flew from my country to Mexico City, and then from there to Seattle. I took the same route on the way back. Overall, it was fairly quick and was by far the best option offered by the travel agency that the company I work for uses (all the other routes were waaay longer or had a lot more legs).
My way there was... o…</span>

                              <span>I have always been lazy and ambitious. My life mostly has been a weird experiment in combining the two. Being ambitious means I want to achieve a lot, something that required hard work. Being lazy means, well I would rather not work hard.
And no this is not some post about smart work. I never understood smart work anyways. It assumes people are dumb and don&#x27;t know how to approach problems from high leverage points. I am not sure if any of these people even exist when you are competing at a high level.
Competing at a high level means you are up against smart crazy human beings willing to burn everything including themselves. You have to grind hard to have a shot. So I had to solve my hard work issue.
I soon realised that my issue was not hard work. It was work that &#x27;felt&#x27; like hard work. I can just program the wet squishy computer between my skull to change the &#x27;feeling&#x27; settings. So hard work feels like a breeze. Even extremely enjoyable.
How can this programming be done? Well the key insight is you can bore yourself to a point that anything is enjoyable. Also you can gaslight yourself into making any mundane task feel grand. So what looks like mundane paperwork to someone on the outside could feel like the holy act of putting ink on paper and rewriting history to you. You get my point right?
Everyone has a different brain and how you programme this squishy thing will be personal to you. Just spend time with yourself. Introspect to read the documentation.
Be the cracked self programmer you need to be!</span>

This afternoon, I miscalculated the the jump from the ground to the bench. It ended up me looking like a rabbit standing on his hind legs with my front paws reaching out.
Unluckily, a child who passed by the park noticed my failure and told his mother.
&quot;Mother, look! That cat couldn&#x27;t jump properly!&quot; He pointed out to his mother while giggling and laughing on their way.</span>

                              <span>in this world, we met much later than usual. college roommates, at the cusp of graduation, in an apartment that resembled the 2nd floor of one the many homes i&#x27;ve left behind. i don&#x27;t remember what you were studying this time around, but your room was always filled with music and the murmur of your friends&#x27; voices.
we lived like strangers for the most part. our schedules never coincided. we were never home at the same time. we spoke infrequently and only via alphabet magnets on our fridge.
&quot;fod here&quot;, &quot;tysm&quot;, &quot;rain tom&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;was loud?&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;
then finally — an intersection. carpooling home from a mutual friend&#x27;s party, squished together in the back seat. i was nodding off and you guided my head to your shoulder. i tell you that it&#x27;s been a while since i&#x27;ve seen you, so you promise to develop a habit of forgetting your keys.
from there, it blurs together. the bump of the road, the hair on my cheek, the itch of your sweater, the gentle hand on my thigh.
i know i&#x27;m meant to love you in every lifetime we meet.</span>

                              <span>The increasing dominance of large firms in the United States has raised concerns about pricing power in the product market. The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span>

                              <span>As Israel began its genocide in Gaza, those who manage U.S. colleges and universities also commenced to issue statements of outrage at what Hamas had done. And as campus protests erupted in condemnation of the slaughter of Gazans, and especially children, and the destruction of homes and every major institution, including hospitals, these same institutions of higher learning began to disrupt these protests and bring them to an end. As a former college teacher, one who witnessed the attacks on those who protested against the War in Vietnam and who studied the repression on campuses during the McCarthy period, I became so appalled at what was being done to our brave and courageous college students that I began to write letters to the leaders of what are, in reality, academic enterprises.

                              <span>As America&#x27;s liberal elites declare open warfare on their own kids, it&#x27;s easy to see why they&#x27;ve shown no empathy at all for the murdered, maimed and orphaned children of Gaza. Back-of-the-head shots to 8-year-olds seem like a legitimate thing to protest in about the most vociferous way possible...But, as Dylan once sang, maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive or else I&#x27;m getting soft.

                              <span>It&#x27;s comforting to think in simplistic terms, to avoid confronting the ugliness of history and actively opposing that same unhinged supremacy that created this world that we currently live in. A world of massive inequality, increasing existential threat, and a misery index on the rise. To bring about something radically different for humankind would be to address the violence inherent to settler colonialism and, in a clear-eyed manner, address the very much ongoing philosophy that the deranged ruling elite have decided is worth continuing at the cost of the vast majority of humanity.

In the morning we went out to a breakfast place, courtesy of our host. When the waitress took our orders, I watched as my coworkers and hosts each ordered a cup of coffee along with their food. During breakfast, they talked about how important coffee is to a scientific workplace.
At our institute, there is a single set of coffee machines on the top floor, set up to encourage interactions among scientists.
When scientists take social breaks, it&#x27;s often coded as &quot;coffee break&quot;. One scientist even wrote an opinion piece encouraging more socialization in science through coffee breaks.
The problem is that I don&#x27;t drink coffee. Honestly, I barely take in caffeine. I used to drink black tea in the morning irregularly, then I tried …</span>

                              <span>The Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
acts as the main connection between the kubelet
and the Container Runtime.
Those runtimes have to provide a gRPC server which has to
fulfill a Kubernetes defined Protocol Buffer interface.
This API definition
evolves over time, for example when contributors add new features or fields are
going to become deprecated.
In this blog post, I&#x27;d like to dive into the functionality and history of three
extraordinary Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), which are truly outstanding in
terms of how they work: Exec, Attach and PortForward.
Exec can be used to run dedicated commands within the container and stream
the output to a client like kubectl or
crictl. It also allows interaction with
that process using standard input (stdin), for example if users want t…</span>

                              <span>With the release of Kubernetes 1.30, the feature to prevent the modification of the volume mode
of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

I thought that instead of typing up another rant, I&#x27;d do something a bit different. I want to share a little anecdote with you.
Around 20 years ago, I joined the British Army; right at the height of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.
Yeah, I&#x27;ve never been the sharpest tool in the box.
Anyway, Iraq was shit. I lost a couple of friends, more were badly hurt, and I myself suffered a minor shrapnel wound.
It&#x27;s fair to say that I saw shit out there that no-one should ever see. I finished my tour of Iraq and less than a year later I found myself in Afghanistan.
For me, Afghan was marginally better than Iraq. I won&#x27;t go into detail as to why as that could reveal who I am, but suffice to say, it wasn&#x27;t quite as shit as Iraq.
I got back from Afghan and I was fucked. Not physically though. Mentally. The Army might spin this yarn that they give their troops the help they need, but the fact of the matter is, if you went to the &quot;Med Centre&quot; claiming you were having mental health problems, you&#x27;d quickly become a laughing stock of the battalion.
You&#x27;d be labelled a pussy. A fanny. Not tough enough be a soldier.
Note: This might not be the case anymore. It&#x27;s been a long time since I served, but that&#x27;s what it was like then I was serving.
So I didn&#x27;t get help, and it utterly fucked me. I was having nightmares. I was taking it out on my loved ones. I was all over the show.
Then my (now) wife convinced me to go see a professional to help me process some of this baggage.
I did, and it really helped. Actually, it was one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done. Do I still have demons? Yes. Do I let them affect my life? For the most part, no.
So, my message to you is - whether you&#x27;re a soldier, a police officer, a fire fighter, a janitor, an office worker, or anything else - if you have shit going on upstairs, don&#x27;t let it fester. Go and see someone about it. Someone impartial, who can just listen and help you process that shit.
You can thank me later.
Peace. ✌️

With 900 million voters—more than the populations of Europe and Australia put together—the Indian elections are hailed as the largest exhibition and celebration of democracy. The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

                              <span>Today I was going over my RSS feeds list in Feedly. I&#x27;ve noticed that I barely see new posts now from bloggers I&#x27;ve been following. So I decided to check their blogs to see what they&#x27;re up to. First one I checked shows that he has switched blogging platforms. Okay...
I checked out his new blogging platform and it is pretty neat. Beautiful design, nice layouts, makes me want to use it too. Checked it out some more and found that they have something like the Discover feed on Bearblog. Decided to click the first post on the list and it turns out to be from some other blogger that I follow. He&#x27;s also on this new platform. What the heck is going on?!
And to think I gave Bearblog a try because I saw him blogging on here. Now he&#x27;s packed up and moved on and left us all here.
Checked out the other blogs/bloggers on this new platform. There was one guy that had 4-5 active blogs, on different platforms it seems. Dude, how are you even maintaining all of those.
If you told me before that I would get FOMO from following blogs, I will tell you you&#x27;re crazy. But what is this I&#x27;m feeling now? I feel like I can&#x27;t keep up and that maybe I should try this other blogging platform too. Christ, I just started on this new blog months ago. I cannot keep up with all these other bloggers. I somewhat feel like I&#x27;m on Facebook again, except the newsfeed is filled with bloggers touting their new blogs. It makes me want to go offline.
How many blogs do we all really need? Apparently, the answer is not enough. It makes me wander what we are really trying to get out of blogging.</span>

Introduction
Kubernetes continues to evolve to meet the intricate requirements of system
administrators and developers alike. A critical aspect of Kubernetes that
ensures the security and integrity of the cluster is the API server
authorization. Until recently, the configuration of the authorization chain in
kube-apiserver was somewhat rigid, limited to a set of command-line flags and
allowing only a single webhook in th…</span>

Motivation
Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible
authentication system. The current system, while powerful, has some limitations
that make it difficult to use in certain scenarios. For example, it is not
possible to use multiple authenticators of the same type (e.g., multiple JWT
authenticators) or to change the configuration without restarting the API server. The

A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.

                              <span>In recent years, the rightful rejection of the policies promoted by the traditional imperialist powers (North America, Western Europe and Japan), followed by the announcements made by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), have aroused great interest and expectations of major changes, including the creation of a common currency to challenge the US dollar as the dominant currency. But what has actually happened? What has been achieved by the New Development Bank and the (...)

                              <span>You clicked at least 2 links with the desire to know me better to get here. I am flattered. So here is the spiel.
I was born and raised in Delhi, India. I have always had this sense of wonder about the world. I grew up reading a lot. Mostly fiction. Hard SciFi, High Fantasy, you get the idea. I was good at academics and my parents kinda lemme do whatever I wanted. Ever since I was 10 I had my own room ,no oversight and an internet connection(yeah ik could have been a disaster). I discovered so much. From the VlogBrothers to Richard Feynman. Changed so much. For the better. Mostly.
I recently graduated with a CS degree. It was challenging and fun tbh. Mostly cuz of the absolutely cracked people I met here and a few passionate profs. These days I write firmware for enterprise servers. Servers you definitely have interacted with unless you live under a rock(how are you reading this then?).
This blog is just me. I decided to put myself out there more. Share my honest thoughts and opinions. Who knows maybe I will say something profound that changes someones life? If not at least a part of my consciousness will be in the future AGI training dataset. Not bad eh?</span>

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>
