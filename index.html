 the world is looking dire right now. it seems like everything is worse than it has ever been, or maybe just like things suddenly flipped back to &quot;bad&quot; after a brief period where it seemed to be getting better. but no matter what happened or how, one thing is clear: the number of socially acceptable targets…</span>

                              <span>&gt; When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team?
All the time. 300-400k SLOC in C++. Legacy in the sense that there were no tests of any kind. Little-to-no documentation. Solo developer at the tiny company. Fix bugs and add features while keeping the system available to the tens of thousands of users.
A more recent example: here’s a patch for a critical feature we need. It was written over a year ago. The original author isn’t available anymore. You can write the code from scratch or try to resurrect the patch against master.
Being able to jump into a project and lead people towards some goal is definitely a skill for senior developer positions. Yes, you generally have a team you can lean on and have the ability to do research and all that. But how do you show that you can do all that in an interview?
Agree with the conclusion that a good thing to test for is for problem-solving.
The tech side depends a lot on what you’re doing. Although it gets ridiculous and organizations get lazy with this part. You don’t need to be white boarding graph algorithms for a junior web developer role. If your application is a social networking role and you’re interviewing a senior developer or architect? Definitely. They’re going to be teaching this stuff and need to understand it at a deep level.</span>

                              <span>I am kind of frustrated by the widespread misunderstandings in this thread.
Laws are best when they are abstract, so that there is no need for frequent updates and they adapt to changing realities. The European &quot;cookie law&quot; does not mandate cookie banners, it mandates informed consent. Companies choose to implement that as a banner.
There is no doubt that the goals set by the law are sensible. It is also not evident that losing time over privacy is so horrible. In fact, when designing a law that enhances consumer rights through informed consent, it is inevitable that this imposes additional time spent on thinking, considering and acting.
It&#x27;s the whole point, folks! You cannot have an informed case-by-case decision without spending time.</span>

                              <span>Inspired by Sylvia and mgx, I decided to create a Bear Micro Blog, or status log, or shorts page – whatever you want to call it.
It&#x27;s quite a simple solution, using tags and the Bear class_name snippet. Having it all in the post template also makes it pretty easy to publish posts. To make posting even easier, I&#x27;m planning to create an Apple Shortcut.
I&#x27;ve also ”created” separate feeds for status and posts:
RSS Feed for All Content
RSS Feed for Blog Posts
RSS feed for Status Updates
Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in getting your own Bear status log and I will post a tutorial.
Wishing you a great weekend!</span>

                              <span>Let’s talk about tech interviews – specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you’re a developer who’s been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I’m talking about. It’s becoming a trend, and it’s not helping anyone.
Unrealistic Tests That Don’t Measure Real Skills
These high-stress, solo coding assignments don’t reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they’d never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures “problem-solving” skills.
The Hidden Time Sink
What companies often ignore is the extra time cand…</span>

                              <span>Letters of recommendation from faculty advisors play a critical role in the job market for Ph.D. economists. At their best, they can convey important qualitative information about a candidate, including the candidate’s potential to generate impactful research. But at their worst, these letters offer a subjective view of the candidate that can be susceptible to conscious or unconscious bias. There may also be similarity or affinity bias, a particularly difficult issue for the economics profession, where most faculty members are white men. In this post, we draw on our recent working paper to describe how recommendation letters differ by the gender, race, or ethnicity of the job candidate and how these differences are related to early career outcomes.</span>

The ones who cost the Democrats the elections are the Democrats themselves. Their humiliating defeat on November 5 was due largely to their undeniable role in the Israeli war and genocide in Gaza.  More

In prepping my lessons, the slides, the activities, etc., I have to always be thinking about how all those things affect the kids. How do they enhance their understanding? How do they engage them? Could I be more flexible in certain areas, or are there skills or topics I really need the kids to understand in a certain way? How can I design this class such that they interact more with each other, have more agency over their learning, can keep up?
Dropping the ball on any aspect of teaching feels huge. When a lesson flops, I feel like I wasted my kids’ time and mine. My evenings are spent thinking about how to get the next one right. There’s no part of this job where I feel I can relax my grip or afford …</span>

It&#x27;s 9:30 PM, and I&#x27;m rushing a bit because I&#x27;m tired, so this is just going to be a rough overview of my thoughts—but $SMCI is shaping up to be something truly special. As of today (November 14th, 2024), I’m officially long on it and have structured my position in some unique ways. It&#x27;s a &quot;Texas-Hedge&quot; to say the least...
Of course, we need to weigh the risks. But before diving into that, it’s crucial to understand why $SMCI has fallen off a cliff from $122.90 (split-adjusted) on March 8 of this year to $17.70 as of today.

We&#x27;re nothing without our stories, how we became who we are. What interests us now, the mistakes we learn from, the highs we celebrate. This is how we connect - through our stories.
Who doesn&#x27;t love a personal story? I believe sharing your experiences and what you learn in life can be helpful &amp; inspirational for others.
This is why I interview people on my YouTube. This is why I write about my life on my blog. This is why I admire storytellers.
Everyone knows the story of Steve Jobs, but what about you? You are entirely unique in the combination of interests and experiences you have. You&#x27;re an interesting person. I encourage you to share what you have to say.

Sadly, all of this came together at the same time as the election, my birthday, and the upcoming holidays which is making for an even more stressful time than typical.
To make matters a bit worse, I haven&#x27;t felt good about retreating into the places that I typically do. A lot of my blogging friends are in pain over the election. My Mastodon feed is depressing, as is most of my RSS. So, I haven&#x27;t really had a place to just breathe online, which has led me to avoid the internet more than usual.

We were in the same room undergoing some strange dating-type event (never mind that my best friend is not single). Neither of us were particularly interested in anyone but couldn’t pick each other, so we both chose our partners strategically to try and live through the event as painlessly as possible. Afterwards, we went somewhere close by and did a postmortem – something we do after calls and TTRPG sessions with our larger friend group.

                              <span>Ask me anything - Do you consider blogging to be an art form?
One thing I absolutely despise is elitism is any form, followed closely by gatekeeping. Sure, people have varying degrees of talent, but I prefer an open society that encourages folks to try their hand at things. It is much better than one that acts like the plebes should stay on the sidelines while the real pros do their thing. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t find it the least bit pretentious when anyone describes themselves as an artist, regardless of the form they choose. I smile when I see anyone present a drawing or a poem or a landscape photo to the world. It&#x27;s an attempt to bring something conjured in one&#x27;s creative spirit to life, shared with the hope that it will spark a feeling in others.

Title: Yintah film review: Anarchists in the blind spot
Subtitle: The necessity to write our own histories
Date: November 9th, 2024
Source: Retrieved on November 14th 2024 from https://bccounterinfo.org/2024/11/09/yintah-documentary-film-review-anarchists-in-the-blind-spot-or-the-necessity-to-write-our-own-histories/

Yintah is the latest installment of a long tradition of indigenous documentaries speaking truth to power against colonial violence in so-called Canada. The story told is of an anti-pipeline struggle to protect the richness of life that the Wedzin kwa river offers, a decade long fight that involved not only the Wet’suwet’en peoples of northern British-Columbia, but also hundreds of dedicated non-indigenous comrades who fought valiantly alongside them.

&gt; if you ...
&gt; for example ...
Yes there seems to be lots of potential. Yes we can brainstorm things that should work. Yes there is a lot of examples of incredible things in isolation. But it&#x27;s a little bit like those youtube videos showing amazing basketball shots in 1 try, when in reality lots of failed attempts happened beforehand. Except our users experience the failed attempts (LLM replies that are wrong, even when backed by RAG) and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to hide those from them.
Show me the things you / your team has actually built that has decent retention and metrics concretely proving efficiency improvements.
LLMs are so hit and miss from query to query that if your users don&#x27;t have a sixth sense for a miss vs a hit, there may not be any efficiency improvement. It&#x27;s a really hard problem with LLM based tools.
There is so much hype right now and people showing cherry picked examples.</span>

                              <span>Question for the group here: do we honestly feel like we&#x27;ve exhausted the options for delivering value on top of the current generation of LLMs?
I lead a team exploring cutting edge LLM applications and end-user features. It&#x27;s my intuition from experience that we have a LONG way to go.
GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 are the go-to models for my team. Every combination of technical investment + LLMs yields a new list of potential applications.
For example, combining a human-moderated knowledge graph with an LLM with RAG allows you to build &quot;expert bots&quot; that understand your business context / your codebase / your specific processes and act almost human-like similar to a coworker in your team.
If you now give it some predictive / simulation capability - eg: simulate the execution of a task or project like creating a github PR code change, and test against an expert bot above for code review, you can have LLMs create reasonable code changes, with automatic review / iteration etc.
Similarly there are many more capabilities that you can ladder on and expose into LLMs to give you increasingly productive outputs from them.
Chasing after model improvements and &quot;GPT-5 will be PHD-level&quot; is moot imo. When did you hire a PHD coworker and they were productive on day-0 ? You need to onboard them with human expertise, and then give them execution space / long-term memories etc to be productive.
Model vendors might struggle to build something more intelligent. But my point is that we already have so much intelligence and we don&#x27;t know what to do with that. There is a LOT you can do with high-schooler level intelligence at super-human scale.
Take a naive example. 200k context windows are now available. Most people, through ChatGPT, type out maybe 1500 tokens. That&#x27;s a huge amount of untapped capacity. No human is going to type out 200k of context. Hence why we need RAG, and additional forms of input (eg: simulation outcomes) to fully leverage that.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.
This mirrors my experience using LLMs on personal projects. They can provide good advice only to the extent that your project stays within the bounds of well-known patterns. As soon as your codebase gets a little bit &quot;weird&quot; (ie trying to do anything novel and interesting), the model chokes, starts hallucinating, and makes your job considerably harder.
Put another way, LLMs make the easy stuff easier, but royally screws up the hard stuff. The gap does appear to be widening, not shrinking. They work best where we need them the least.</span>

                              <span>I have a bit of uneasiness about how this is heavily pushing GitHub actions as the correct way to publish to PyPI. I had to check PEP740 to make sure it was not directly supported by Microsoft.
&gt; The generation and publication of attestations happens by default, and no changes are necessary for projects that meet all of these conditions: publish from GitHub Actions; via Trusted Publishing; and use the pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish action to publish.
If you then click on &quot;The manual way&quot; it adds a big disclaimer:
&gt; STOP! You probably don&#x27;t need this section; it exists only to provide some internal details about how attestation generation and uploading work. If you&#x27;re an ordinary user, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the official workflows described above.
Where the only official workflow is &quot;Use GitHub Actions&quot;.
I guess I am an idealist but as a maintainer this falls short of my expectations  for the openness of Python and PyPI.</span>

&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; The Onion, with the help of the Sandy Hook families, has purchased InfoWars.
&gt; We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website.
&gt; We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off.
&gt; I can&#x27;t wait to show you what we have cooked up.

                              <span>This is one of the few HN articles that have profoundly moved me. Such a beautiful and simple use of technology to make a clear and big improvement in someone&#x27;s life.
As a side note on his mother remembering that the tablet exists, it sounds like she has amnesia quite like Henry Molaison, a famous case study in neuropathology. He had very specific brain damage that seemingly stopped him forming new memories in the same way as OP&#x27;s mother, but studies showed that he could remember some things, just not consciously. So for example he would have warm feelings towards people who&#x27;d been caring for him despite not remembering them, and would also pick up card games more and more quickly as he played them repeatedly despite saying he didn&#x27;t remember the game. OP&#x27;s mother remembering the tablet sounds very similar, particularly when paired with the feeling of being remembered and loved by her children.</span>

This reminds me of a desire I&#x27;ve had for a long time: a simple, wall-mountable eInk device that could be configured with a URL (+wifi creds) and render a markdown file, refreshing once every hour or so. It would be so useful for so many applications – I&#x27;m a parish priest and so I could use it to let people know what events are on, if a service is cancelled, the current prayer list, ... the applications would be endless. I&#x27;d definitely pay a couple of hundred dollars per device for a solid version of such a thing, if it could be mounted and then recharged every month or two.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Billing alerts&quot; are a joke, give us hard spend limits. Then offer a way to set those limits during onboarding.
Building a business on blank cheques and accidental spends is shady. It&#x27;s also a large barrier to adoption. The more times devs see reports like, &quot;I tried [random 20-minute tutorial] and woke up to a bill for my life&#x27;s savings and luckily support waived the fee this one time but next time they&#x27;re coming for my house&quot;, the less they&#x27;ll want to explore your offerings.</span>

                              <span>Hi HN, Francois here. Happy to answer any questions!
Here&#x27;s a start --
&quot;Did you get poached by Anthropic/etc&quot;: No, I am starting a new company with a friend. We will announce more about it in due time!
&quot;Who uses Keras in production&quot;: Off the top of my head the current list includes Midjourney, YouTube, Waymo, Google across many products (even Ads started moving to Keras recently!), Netflix, Spotify, Snap, GrubHub, Square/Block, X/Twitter, and many non-tech companies like United, JPM, Orange, Walmart, etc. In total Keras has ~2M developers and powers ML at many companies big and small. This isn&#x27;t all TF -- many of our users have started running Keras on JAX or PyTorch.
&quot;Why did you decide to merge Keras into TensorFlow in 2019&quot;: I didn&#x27;t! The decision was made in 2018 by the TF leads -- I was a L5 IC at the time and that was an L8 decision. The TF team was huge at the time, 50+ people, while Keras was just me and the open-source community. In retrospect I think Keras would have been better off as an independent multi-backend framework -- but that would have required me quitting Google back then. Making Keras multi-backend again in 2023 has been one of my favorite projects to work on, both from the engineering &amp; architecture side of things but also because the product is truly great (also, I love JAX)!</span>

                              <span>Rapid GDP growth, due in part to high rates of investment and capital accumulation, has raised China out of poverty and into middle-income status. But progress in raising living standards has lagged, as a side-effect of policies favoring investment over consumption. At present, consumption per capita stands some 40 percent below what might be expected given China&#x27;s income level. We quantify China&#x27;s consumption prospects via the lens of the neoclassical growth model. We find that shifting the country&#x27;s production mix toward consumption would raise both current and future living standards, with the latter result owing to diminishing returns to capital accumulation. Chinese policy, however, appears to be moving in the opposite direction, to reemphasize investment-led growth.</span>

                              <span>This is a win for price competition - the &quot;broker fee&quot; paid by the renter is a classic example of principal agent problems / information asymmetry.
First, the service is being provided to the landlord (listing, tours, etc.), not the client, for all listings these days (I don&#x27;t know any young person who has ever used a renter&#x27;s agent, except maybe if it&#x27;s provided in a relocation package). The renter has no choice in which broker to use to find/transact w/ the property, so there&#x27;s very little price pressure for these broker fees.
Second the information asymmetry - the terms of the fee are completely opaque in the listings, and are not disclosed basically until signing unless you press brokers earlier. So there&#x27;s basically no competitive pressure pushing these fees down, since it&#x27;s basically a &quot;junk fee&quot; from a user experience perspective tacked on at the very end (and not listed on listings), and the landlord - who IS in a position to negotiate on price - doesn&#x27;t care.
I don&#x27;t buy the argument that there will be some long-term price hike in rents as a result of this decision - people who rent for 1-5 years already are paying a MASSIVE &quot;net effective&quot; premium for having an additional month&#x27;s rent tacked on up front - but also it strongly incentivizes tenant retention (e.g. by being more responsive, keeping prices lower, etc.), because the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker&#x27;s fee next listing.</span>

                              <span>U.S. household debt balances grew by $147 billion (0.8 percent) over the third quarter, according to the latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed’s Center for Microeconomic Data. Balances on all loan products recorded moderate increases, led by mortgages (up $75 billion), credit cards (up $24 billion), and auto loans (up $18 billion). Meanwhile, delinquency rates have also risen over the past two years, returning to roughly pre-pandemic levels (and exceeding them in the case of credit cards and auto loans), though there are some signs of stabilization this quarter. Are rising aggregate debt burdens sustainable? Or is this expansion to be expected given increases in aggregate income and population size? In this post, we take a look at debt balances scaled by income, tracking the evolution of this ratio over the past twenty-five years.</span>

🔬Small web has divided my career life as an indie developer to two phases:
My life before knowing about small web
And my life after knowing it.
What is the small web?
My quick, not complete answer, using an example: Personal websites/blogs people are making and hosting themselves are part of the small web.
You can find many of these websites here:
https://blogroll.org
🔆 You can start learning more about the small web by visiting these websites and keep clicking the links inside them to start a never ending journey into the small web 🐇🕳rabbit hole👇
Learn anything about the small web movement
you can find lots of resources and links to small web projects on this page:

And here in this page Aral, the developer of Kitten (One of the best full stack’s for creating small web apps), talks about the small web.

Tove is not my cat, but she is the cat I live with. She&#x27;s also less a cat than some kind of cross between a small bird and a meringue, making her strange little chirps for attention all hours of the day. She used to be a terribly shy and anxious thing but has grow…</span>

                              <span>I work in EdTech, I have for a very long time now, and the problem I have seen is no one in education is willing to ACTUALLY let kids learn at their own level.
The promise of EdTech was that kids could learn where they are. A kid who&#x27;s behind can actually continue to learn rather than being left behind. A kid who&#x27;s ahead can be nurtured.
We had this. It worked well, in my opinion at least, and the number of complaints and straight up threats because kids would learn things &quot;they shouldn&#x27;t be&quot; was just… insanely frustrating.
Now in order to keep schools paying for our services, every kid is banded into a range based on their grade. They are scored/graded based on their grade level rather than their growth. It&#x27;s such a crying shame.</span>

                              <span>One of my first requests for Bear, about two years ago, was for an archive feature. There still isn&#x27;t one, but I had an idea when I read today that Herman added filtering by multiple tags.
I thought it would work well to create a nice blog archive. Inspired by the cool archive that mgx has, which I don&#x27;t have the skills to create, this is what I came up with.
By assigning month and year as tags for each post and then using the embedded posts feature, it&#x27;s fairly easy to create an archive. The downside is that once a month, the archive page and the post template need to be updated, but I think that&#x27;s okay.
A small advantage is that you can choose to exclude posts you don&#x27;t want in the list, and that for one reason or another are not suitable as pages.
Happy blogging!</span>

                              <span>Note: This one has an HN thread.
I lost a Stripe dispute of USD $210 because the customer that purchased tickets from my site used an email that he claimed to his bank was not his. Stripe and the bank asked me to provide evidence that this wasn&#x27;t fraudulent and I sent them:
The invoice sent to the email the customer entered
The actual tickets that were sent
Despite this evidence I lost the dispute because of the customer&#x27;s &quot;it wasn&#x27;t me&quot; defense. Here&#x27;s Bank of America&#x27;s response:
Compelling documents shows name is matching with customer, but email id and ip address does not match with our customer. No
proof our customer benefited from this transaction. Our customer maintains charge is unauthorized/fraud.
This is a lie because I never even sent them the IP address since that isn&#x27;t shown in…</span>

                              <span>This is great. I particularly liked this observation:
&gt; Shipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.
A lot of the ideas in here resonated with me a lot. This is the kind of article I wish I&#x27;d read before I spent a few years leading an engineering team at a medium-sized tech company!</span>

                              <span>&gt; Google pioneered many now standard tech practices: on-site cafés, A/B tests, and “dogfooding,” or first releasing new products internally where they can be improved before launching to the public.
Famously, Microsoft and others pioneered dogfooding decades before the events described in this article and approximately a decade (at least) before Google came into existence.
And I’m 99% certain company cafes existed at least a half century before Google invented the concept.</span>

                              <span>I am from south India where a lot of wild elephants roam the villages and towns. When elephants come to roam the streets most people lock themselves in their homes and alert the forest division authorities. Someone I know once rescued a baby elephant from a trap set for boars. Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts. They wait for him to come out, make a friendly gesture - folding their trunks in a specific way, and leave peacefully. Our elders tell us that elephants have memory and show gratitude and they can hold a grudge so be respectful all the time.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
My main background is a hedge fund professional, so I deal with finance data all the time and so far the Pandas library has been an indispensable tool in my workflow and my most used Python library.


Then came along Polars (written in Rust, btw!) which shook the ground of Python ecosystem due to its speed and efficiency, you can check some of Polars benchmark here.
I have around +/- 30 thousand lines of Pandas code, so you can understand why I&#x27;ve been hesitant to rewrite them to Polars, despite my enthusiasm for speed and optimization. The sheer scale of the task has led to repeated delays, as I weigh the potential benefits of a faster and more efficient library against the significant effort required to refactor my existing code.
There has always been this thought in the bac…</span>

                              <span>I suffered from this.
The issue is the ego. Ego has a lot of ideas about itself and others. Ego has such high opinion about itself it only can do great work. Which prevents it from doing anything. It&#x27;s kind of a way of avoiding failures. Because failures will break the grant ideas about himself OP has created.
I accidentally went through a spiritual awakening which diluted ego. I have no problem in doing any kind of work now. Whether it&#x27;s great or petty.
OP needs to work on the ego. Or figure out a situation where OP has to ship things no matter what. Which is hard unless you are jobless and can&#x27;t figure a way out apart from building useful things that people pay for.</span>

                              <span>As the FT put it: “In the end, it wasn&#x27;t even close. A presidential election long forecast to dance on a knife&#x27;s edge very quickly turned out to be a rout for Donald Trump.” Trump polled 73.4m votes or 50.7% of the those who voted, while Harris polled 60m or 47.7% of the vote. Third party candidates mustered just 1.6%. Trump&#x27;s 4.3m lead was more than Biden had in 2020, or Hillary Clinton had over Trump in 2016.

                              <span>My wife and I have been watching Parks and Rec a lot lately. Every ad break it seems like one of Apple&#x27;s ads for &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; comes up. These ads feature someone suddenly realizing that they&#x27;re unprepared: a wife realizes that she forgot her husband&#x27;s birthday; a lawyer realizes that he forgot to read an important document; an actor realizes that they forgot to read a pitch for a show. The unprepared person is able to quickly &quot;save the day&quot; by using Apple Intelligence to generate a summary of important information, or in the wife&#x27;s case, to generate an animated slideshow of sentimental photos.
These ads consistently leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.
Obviously, everyone is unprepared sometimes. Everyone occasionally forgets an important birthday, or shows up to a meeting without having prepped. That&#x27;s part of being human. The myth of AI is that we can eliminate human fallibility, that we can smooth out our rough edges with enough technology. News flash: more technology won&#x27;t make us more perfect. The more we expect &quot;perfection&quot; from others, the less grace we will have with them. The less space we leave for forgiveness and understanding.</span>

 …what do you get? Answer: “Special Little Freedom Zones.” 
 That’s what Reason’s Liz Wolfe calls the Honduran “charter cities,” officially known as ZEDEs (Zones for Economic Development and Employment), which were declared illegal in September by the Honduran Supreme Court (“No More Special Little Freedom Zones,”” September 25). The ruling prohibits the creation of new ZEDEs; its effect on existing ones, like Próspera, Ciudad Morazán, and Zede Orquidea, is as yet unknown. 
 Wolfe describes such charter cities as “special economic economic zones that are still bound by criminal law but able to create their own c…</span>
