                              <span>According to Israeli sources, the Biden administration wanted to avoid a broader regional conflict that might involve the Resistance in Lebanon, Yemen and Iran, at least until after the U.S. elections in November. However, all indications suggest that Netanyahu is resisting the American demands, and even disregarding the opinion of his own war minister who does not believe it’s the right time to expand the war. Netanyahu’s preparations for the war could also include dismissing Yaov Gallant and replacing him with Gideon Sa&#x27;ar from the New Hope Jewish racist party. This prompted Biden to send Hochstein to warn the Israeli prime minister of dangerous consequence if he moves ahead and dismisses Gallant. More

The hope we must have is that at some point this will wake people up and force action at the scale that is required before we have plunged too much deeper into the danger zone. That is why we must continue struggling through our grief and uncertainties, and counter any sense of powerlessness with action, to do all we can to wake up the world and push its political and economic elites to action.

                              <span>&gt; US manufacturing is about to be reinvigorated
One thing that I think that frequently eludes people in this discussion is that US manufacturing has pretty much been constantly growing for the past century; just its share of GDP has fallen as other sectors have grown faster.  And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation.
I think the actual outcome of this policy is mixed.  I think it was a big case of corporate welfare that will result in somewhat increased chip production in the US.  I think this is a win for national security.  I don&#x27;t think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won&#x27;t be a win for economic output or quality of life.</span>

This is a significant win for the US, and just the beginning of the amazing industrial policy passed over the past few years.
US manufacturing is about to be reinvigorated, and we in the US are going to be building our own future both for chips and for energy security.
This is great news, and we should celebrate.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s an impressive supply-chain hack. Spend years showing how insecure modern telecom devices are and scare your enemy into going old-school, receive-only. Set up a shell company to sell pagers to your enemy&#x27;s shell company. Give them devices implanted with a small explosive charge pointed inward, knowing they will be worn around the waist most of the time.
Hack the backend server, send a coordinated page to all the pagers at the same time. You&#x27;ve just injured and identified most of your enemies, incapacitated them, completely broken their communication network and effectively given you weeks of disarray to do whatever you want to further disrupt them.
You have to hand it to them -- it&#x27;s a clever strategy with minimal casualties outside of your enemy. This is a Stuxnet-level hack that we&#x27;ll probably never fully understand.</span>

I think it&#x27;s far more likely that Mossad has infiltrated whatever foreign (non-Israeli) supply chain they were using.
So this can happen regardless of whether you&#x27;re using Israeli supply chains or not.</span>

                              <span>From Israel&#x27;s perspective, this supply chain attack was undoubtedly a clever move, but I can&#x27;t help but wonder about its long-term consequences.
Although it was aimed at harming Israel&#x27;s adversaries, third-party countries may now hesitate to involve Israel in their supply chains. There&#x27;s also the risk that other major producers could replicate this tactic, potentially leading to further escalation in the region or beyond.
In the short term, it&#x27;s a smart strategy for Israel, but they&#x27;ve likely opened Pandora&#x27;s box in the process.</span>

                              <span>If we try to do what we are best at here at HN, let’s focus the discussion on the technical aspects of it.
It immediately reminded me of Stuxnet, which also from a technical perspective was quite interesting.
I already wonder if this was anything that was planted in the devices perviously, or if the ones responsible had similar devices, and managed reverse engineer them and craft a payload to them, that could be sent over existing cellular protocols/networks and then, similar to Stuxnet, make the device exagerte some existing functionality to a point where it caused a malfunction? Thoughts on this?</span>

                              <span>Abstract This paper argues for the elimination of the surcharge policy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It explores the legal history of surcharges and underscores that there are precedents (i.e., in 1974, 1981, and 1992) for their complete removal. The paper also shows that surcharges are a burden on indebted countries and that the Fund&#x27;s official arguments for retaining them do not hold.

                              <span>Doing hard things is important. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. And lets be honest. It feels good to hit the bed at the end of the day when you know you worked hard. That self satisfaction is indescribable.
But how to do hard things? The answer is &#x27;deliberate mental training&#x27;. When I was young I would get lazy, feel bad about myself and then get the work done. If I generated enough momentum it would last long, otherwise it would just last a few days and the cycle would repeat.
My perspective changed over the years. I don&#x27;t know if it was one podcast or one book that did it or a bunch of things. But I came to look at myself more as an intellectual athlete. And just like an athlete needs physical training to get better, I needed mental training.
A lot goes into an athlete achieving peak performance. Deliberate pracise, the right mindset, diet, the right tools and lets admit it - some genetics. It is the same for an intellectual athlete. Focus on what you can control and get better. The point is to improve &#x27;your&#x27; peak performance and not to compete with some genetic freak training since they were born.
As far as frameworks go this is both very practical and very powerful. If you are out of shape and want to run a marathon you don&#x27;t expect to do it one day one. You work up to it. You don&#x27;t see some pro marathon runner on social media doing insane times and feel discouraged. You know your body is malleable. You can see the fat on it. The pain in your calves when you run. You know it gets better.
The same is true for our brains. Mental training makes your brain stronger. Be able to do hard things. To get started and stay focused. To not get frustrated when you hit blocks. All these are part of mental training. Something you get better at. And you need to keep training to not get out of shape. And if you ever go out of shape or get lazy you know you just need to train yourself back up to your glory days.
Start training.</span>

                              <span>&gt; If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well.
This is Amazon having it both ways, which is what a lot of companies are doing. You can work remotely &#x27;sometimes,&#x27; with a secret definition of &#x27;sometimes,&#x27; operating in the background.
I found this paragraph to be somewhat galling since, like, if you&#x27;re sick you shouldn&#x27;t work at all, you should be focussing on getting well. Ditto if your kid is sick. Raising one or more whole other human/s is a super important thing. One result I saw from the pandemic is fathers doing more of the childcare, and what full-RTO like this fundamentally does is shift that dynamic back to where it was before.
Shame on Amazon.</span>

                              <span>As a firmware engineer, my job demands more &quot;in-office-y&quot; stuff than most other engineers on HN. I have specialized equipment. Hardware. I need to interface with manufacturing. So on.
Guess what? I&#x27;m going on 1 year fully remote, and I&#x27;m doing great! Turns out, all that fancy equipment can be brought home with you. We deal with a contract manufacturer, and emailing them from home is no harder than emailing them from the office. Instead of being stuck in a concrete jungle, I can go test the product out in a more realistic environment in the park across from my home. It&#x27;s made me happier, healthier AND more productive. Eliminating 2 hours a day of driving and train rides left me with more energy I can expend on my work! Who&#x27;da thunk it?</span>

                              <span>I feel like Big Tech management is simply in revenge mode. Managers and executives felt a tiny bit less powerful for a small amount of time  due to their workers pushing for remote and having the leverage to do so. Now that interest rates have wrecked the employment market they are wasting no time going scorched earth on their current remote employees. The narratives they keep shoving down peoples throats are insulting at best. They should just tell everyone they want to stand over people and feel powerful and get it over with.</span>

The only engineers,IMO, that like it there are those adept at finding new bootstrapped teams and designing and writing the product from scratch and releasing the MVP. They then hand over the crappy MVP to other engineers to support and move on to other new products. On-call is absolutely brutal because of exactly that.</span>

                              <span>Genuine question for the folks over at Amazon:
What is the value of working at Amazon (or even just AWS) these days? Every now and then I get a ring from a recruiter gauging my interest and sometimes I get the itch to just to go through the process so that I can have a FAANG in my resume.
I&#x27;ve heard from others that Amazon could be an amazing place to work, citing fantastic colleagues and work opportunities. But then again, Amazon doesn&#x27;t claim monopoly on those and one has to assume the risk of working for a place that churns people out and has upper-level management that are hostile to IC&#x27;s needs/wants.
Perhaps a better question is - if one can get an offer at other FAANGs and the equivalents... is there a reason to choose Amazon over others?</span>

                              <span>From [1] The story of PING:
  ping goodhost | sed -e &#x27;s/.*/ping/&#x27; | vocoder

He wired the vocoder&#x27;s output into his office stereo and turned up the volume as loud as he could stand. The computer sat there shouting &quot;Ping, ping, ping...&quot; once a second, and he wandered through the building wiggling Ethernet connectors until the sound stopped. And that&#x27;s how he found the intermittent failure.

                              <span>There are lot of comments here disliking MrBeast and what not, but some of the advice can definitely apply to all organizations.
&gt; Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.
Replace &quot;youtube videos&quot; with whatever the company is trying to achieve. I see it all the time in large organizations, where different teams forget what the goal of the company is and instead get hyperfocused on their teams KPI&#x27;s to the detriment of the company as a whole.
Lawyers finding problems and trying to stop things from happening instead of finding solutions. Security blocking things and not suggesting alternatives. IT blocking this or that instead of trying solve problems, etc.</span>

                              <span>This entire blog post assumes agency that you, the EM or Team lead, rarely have in an organisation that is on a &quot;wartime&quot; footing.  It&#x27;s cosplay.
Real wartime footing:
1. Direction and technical decisions are driven by priorities of board-level members and often arrive in email form late on Friday evening.  The entire organisation is expected to pivot immediately. A new senior leadership team member starts scheduling daily read-outs on project progress, and half the organisation spends the weekend frantically hallucinating project plans into Google Sheets.
2. Engineering staff react with dull-eyed disbelief on Monday; they knew this was coming, because the same thing happened a month ago, and six weeks before that.
3. Emails come from HR that there are are new, even-more-labyrinthine approval processes for expenses, and shrinking budgets for anything not directly related to whatever the projet du jour, which will be fed enough to make it look like it&#x27;s succeeding until the next Friday evening email kills it.
4. There is wide-spread burn-out across Engineering teams, and people are reduced to reactive, sarcastic automatons.
5. A creeping understanding seizes the better engineers that things cannot improve; they sign articles of  Armistice, pretend to comply, and start interviewing elsewhere.
6. An email arrives on Friday night...
&gt; Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company&#x27;s still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what&#x27;s still good can help with morale.

EPIPELAGOS
 All the wretched creatures of the earth wish to return to the sea. This I am now certain of. 
 The ocean is divided into five major zones, each characterized by their depth. Depth can be thought of best in terms of proximity to the sun and the earth’s core. The Epipelagic zone is characterized by its close proximity to light, the essential source of energy for all life on Earth. Proximity to light allows for a high degree of biodiversity. 90% of all life i…</span>

                              <span>When I was on my previous blogging platform, I had a blog titled Snaps by JCProbably. The idea of it was to post casual photos instead of the more “curated” photos that I post on jeddacp.me.
After I left the platform, it kind of just sat there. I still wanted a place to post photos of whatever somewhere without clogging up this blog (because I wanted this to be more focused on text), or my other one (because that’s more focused on giving people context to go along with the photos). Once again, it’s a little bit more about my need for separation of spaces.
Anyways, I finally got around to transferring my photos from there to Bear blog yesterday. Feel free to follow along my posts on Snaps using this RSS feed.
My photos there will likely just be everyday shots—quick snaps (probably from my phone) that I would typically share on social media, like Instagram Stories, but I&#x27;m choosing to share them in my own corner of the internet instead.
Anyways.
For those who are new here, the breakdown of my blogs is now as follows:
JEDDACP.ME (aka unnamed): photos with an average amount of text to go along with it for context. This is the one I share with people freely. The original of the 3.
Notes by JCProbably (this): primarily text based posts.
Snaps by JCProbably (new): photos of things that catch my eye, with minimal to no accompanying text.

                              <span>Like a lot of folks I know through Cohost and gamedev, I&#x27;ve started using Bear for blogging. This means I&#x27;ve left Wordpress behind after nearly 15 years on that service.
Bear is a fantastic blogging service for people who like to touch computers... but don&#x27;t want to touch computers That Much. It has a web-based post composition UI which takes markdown, which is about all I want. I want to minimize the UI fuckery needed to put words on the internet, and these days, Wordpress is all about UI fuckery.
I migrated over the vast majority of posts from my old Wordpress site and laboriously set up URL aliases, so all of them should continue to receive any incoming links they had in the past. I also took some time to heal some link rot in the older posts back between 2013-2016 or so... I was linking to a lot of twines which don&#x27;t seem to be online at all anymore. Where possible, I&#x27;ve left a note about missing content.
Bear provides everything you need to migrate Wordpress content, but it isn&#x27;t a simple task. The Bear documentation states that it takes the site owner only about 30 minutes to migrate a blog with about 60 posts, but it took me several days of intermittent work. That was mostly because I cared so much about setting up the dates and aliases correctly.
If you&#x27;re seeing this in RSS, then you have proof that the RSS migration worked perfectly as well. (I don&#x27;t have proof of that yet, which is part of why I&#x27;m running this post.) I selected Bear partially because it was so easy for me to confirm that I could set up an RSS alias identical to the one Wordpress had given me--and that whoever was following me from back in ancient days wouldn&#x27;t lose track of what I was doing over here.
Thank you to Dante and Bruno for showing me this tool! It&#x27;s 3 USD cheaper per month than my current Wordpress package, and a lot simpler.</span>

                              <span>I wrote a small thing about Cohost that I’ll probably come back to later for, like, some kinda actual “goodbye to this site”-type post but for now I just want to think (out loud) a bit on something that came up in the aforementioned post. I brought up that my digital art journey began on deviantART, touching on how critical that place was for the skills I developed and the artist I’d become.
2006 wasn’t the start of that site by any means but it was pretty early. Early enough in both its respective era and the greater “access to internet” era that its userbase skewed a lot younger and the community there was dictated by that. My friends and I there would pass around questionnaires that were fun “get to know me” kinda things and you’d build a more tight-knit group of folks around that!

                              <span>Are you thinking about starting a blog but feel like you haven&#x27;t found &quot;your voice&quot; yet?
That&#x27;s understandable; many people feel the same way. Luckily, there&#x27;s a solution to the problem:
Start blogging!
There&#x27;s no better way. Or rather, it&#x27;s the only way.
We might have written hundreds of texts trying to find our blogging voice, but it&#x27;s only when we publish them publicly that we discover our direction and begin to understand ourselves as writers. We discover that what we considered trash is someone else’s treasure. We understand that many people identify with what we thought we were alone in feeling.
We find ourselves by connecting with others.
My first blog in Swedish started as a complete mess and then slowly but surely developed into a pure tech blog. Although technology were and still is a big interest of mine, I could never have figured out in advance that that was the direction my blogging would take. It came naturally thanks to starting to blog.
This blog is my first &quot;serious&quot; one in English. It&#x27;s still relatively new and doesn&#x27;t have a specific focus at the moment, although many of the texts are about blogging. Maybe it will continue like this, or maybe I&#x27;ll start a separate blog about writing online. I don&#x27;t know; time will tell...
What I do know, however, is that I will never find the answer by just sitting and writing texts privately.
Are you sitting on a bunch of texts waiting to find your voice? Get them out there! That&#x27;s where they do good – both for others and for yourself.</span>

                              <span>over the weekend, i decided i wanted to add a now page to my site. the problem here is that i am bad at remembering to update things (especially more than one thing). in my ideal world, i could have it live update with things like what movies i&#x27;ve watched recently (from letterboxd), tv (trakt, which i don&#x27;t currently use but maybe should), music (only once i fix my scrobbling setup), books (storygraph), etc etc etc.
at a glance, you&#x27;d assume that bear doesn&#x27;t support this sort of thing, given its static-approach. i would say that this is a limitation of imagination; you can actually just throw whatever in here, including in the header and footer.
my first test for this is using htmx to populate a list of recently watched movies (served by a small app at blog-data.jkap.io) on page load. while it&#x27;s not perfect (i don&#x27;t love the &quot;loading&quot; flash and layout shift) it was easy to setup and works Well Enough for now.
when i say easy, i mean it. this is the extent of the code:

  loading...


you can see it in action on my now page. i&#x27;m planning to add more in here over time. just gimme a bit.</span>

                              <span>One distressing trend I&#x27;ve noticed becoming ubiquitous on HN is that any writing that is confronting to a consensus worldview becomes flooded with highly upvoted comments that are, in essence, excuses for why it&#x27;s not necessary in this instance to re-examine your priors.
He&#x27;s making low value content/the culture of the company is horrible/he&#x27;s a fraud/it&#x27;s more luck than skill. The actual critiques are personalized to the content and, to one extent or another, valid, but the social purpose of the critiques is universal which is that I felt uncomfortable that reading this might mean I have to re-evaluate my worldview and I&#x27;m going to dive into the comment section and upvote all the people telling me actually, I don&#x27;t have to do that.
I actually spent over an hour writing 750+ words of my takeaways reading this document and shared it privately with a few founder friends of mine and I briefly considered also posting to share with the community but I took a look at the comments and took a look at what I wrote and decided I didn&#x27;t have the energy to face the endless onslaught of nitpicks and misunderstandings that are driven, at the end of the day, not by a genuine intellectual desire to reach an understanding, but by the need to prove emotionally that others are not taking this seriously so I don&#x27;t have to either.
All I can do is be vague and say I think this was an enormously valuable piece of writing that is worth engaging seriously for what it is as it might change your worldview in several important ways.
But also my larger meta-point is that there&#x27;s a now near ubiquitous &quot;sour grapes&quot; attitude that&#x27;s pervaded HN that makes it an extremely unpleasant place to hold a conversation and people reading should be aware of this systematic bias when reading comments here.</span>

You could say that about literally any shady business. Imagine seeing a PDF proving tobacco leaders knew for decades that it caused cancer and saying what you did.

                              <span>It all feels like theatre. Been working in many companies in “war mode” and they all think that in order to become profitable (none of them were) you need to push the most “important” features out of the door asap, otherwise your competitors will eat you alive.
It’s a lie. Executives and VPs and all those folks that earn 5x what a normal engineer earns, don’t really care about the company they work for. All they care about is to keep receiving the big pay checks until the ship sinks. Obviously you cannot just mandate “normal mode”, otherwise it wouldn’t look as if everyone is doing their best to keep the company afloat.
I hope in 10 years or so, we’ll see “wartime software engineering” with the same eyes we see today Agile and Scrum masters: snake oil.</span>

                              <span>Lot of people critiquing this, but you can&#x27;t deny the success. I think a lot of the advice is applicable to startups.
1. KPIs, for Beast they are CTR, AVD, AVP, will look different if you are a startup. I am willing to bet he knows his metrics better than &gt;95% of startup founders. Because he is literally hacking/being judged by an algorithm, his KPIs will matter more and can be closely dissected. Startups aren&#x27;t that easy in that sense, but KPIs still matter.
2. Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.
3. Building value &gt; making money
4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders/equity owners, not employees.
5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.
The management/communication stuff is mostly about working on set/dealing with physical scale. You need a lot more hands dealing with logistics, which requires hardline communication and management. In startups, the team is usually really lean and technical, so management becomes more straightforward.
I am also getting some bad culture vibes from the PDF and really dislike the writing style. I think it&#x27;s important not to micromanage to the extent he is--it&#x27;s necessary, maybe, for his business. Not for startups. Interesting perspective, reminds me of a chef de cuisine in a cutthroat 90s kitchen. The dishes (videos) have to be perfect, they require a lot of prep and a lot of hands, and you have to consistently pump them out.</span>

                              <span>This sucks. Cache basically guaranteed that whatever Google thought was on the page could actually be found.
These days Google will offer a result where the little blurb (which is actually a truncated mini cache) shows a part of the information I&#x27;m looking for, but the page itself does not. Removing cache means the data is just within reach, but you can&#x27;t get to it anymore.
Internet Archive is a hassle and not as reliable as an actual copy of the page where the blurb was extracted from.</span>

When I inspect houses as part of my work, I always advise homeowners to check their attics a couple of times a year. I also suggest making it as easy as possible to do so, for example by installing a built-in ladder. If it feels too cumbersome to check your attic, it&#x27;s easy to put it off.
For the same reason, I want as little resistance as possible when it comes to blogging. I keep my blog post ideas easily accessible, no matter where I am. When it&#x27;s time to write, I do it in the default text editor if I&#x27;m at my computer, or in my phone&#x27;s standard notes app.
After translating (I always write in Swedish) and editing the text, I open the browser shortcut to create a new blog post. I preview it and maybe do some formatting. Then I publish the post.
The Blogging Workflow
When I read certain blogging workflows, I&#x27;m surprised at how complicated they seem. At the same time, I think that for those particular bloggers, the technical aspect is one of the reasons they enjoy blogging. It&#x27;s not a barrier; it&#x27;s an example of the importance of interests.
My approach of writing in Swedish and then translating into English can certainly be perceived as complicated. But I find it fun and interesting. It took quite a while before I found a way to write in English in a way that I felt good about.
Regardless of your approach to blogging, make sure it feels easy and fun. &quot;Easy&quot; is of course very individual in this case. That&#x27;s where the &quot;fun&quot; part comes in - easy can be technically complicated in a fun way.
3 Tips for Easy Blogging
It should work on any device.
It should work no matter where you are.
It should be easy to go from writing to publishing.
We live in a time of almost unlimited possibilities. Take this opportunity to play around. Find a setup that suits you, and don&#x27;t be afraid to try new methods.
Keep on blogging!</span>

If you have team sizes set sanely and empower devs to do what they need to do in order to accomplish the goal, they&#x27;ll be fine without the management overhead of arbitrarily imposed productivity flow.  Agile et al, along with 99% of the features in ticketing systems, exist to make managers feel like they are justifying their paycheck.
If you are a manager and this makes you angry, you&#x27;re one of the bad ones.</span>

2) Tell everyone born between 1980 and 1995 that they&#x27;ll be unable to compete in the global marketplace if they don&#x27;t get at least some post-high school education, and imply that the mere presence of a degree will help instead of having a specific type of degree
3) Have next-to-zero standards for public funds used in grant and loan programs for college education, meaning people can take out loans for any sort of degree program at almost any sort of institution
4) Hold these debtors to standards that aren&#x27;t applied to other types of debtors. You cannot discharge them through bankruptcy, it&#x27;s very difficult to renegotiate, and SCOTUS has said that the chief executive of the note-holding institution (in this case, the President of the United States) cannot use discretion in deciding who he gets to forgive for loans.</span>

                              <span>Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.
I work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it&#x27;s able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many &quot;problem shapes&quot;. For instance, I can give it a logic problem like &quot;i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially&quot; and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.
Yes, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.
side: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.
Many of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.</span>

                              <span>hello! it&#x27;s blogging time.
now that cohost is shutting down, i&#x27;m setting up a new home for whatever long-form (or even medium-form) writing i do. i&#x27;ve found over time that the microblogging formats of most social media don&#x27;t really work for me, and i like having ownership / control of my writing. so here we are.
i&#x27;m spending some time migrating some of my favorite posts over from cohost to here; you can view them in the #cohost tag if you so wish.
i&#x27;m planning to write more about my overall Feelings around the cohost shutdown soon; there&#x27;s a lot of things i&#x27;d do differently if we were to do it again, but i&#x27;m proud of what we accomplished regardless.
one thing that i&#x27;ve been contending with in the wake of the shutdown announcement is the outpouring of love for cohost that i&#x27;ve gotten from s…</span>

As someone who has dealt with chronic depression since the 1980s, I could share about that. But the more powerful story is how I felt almost 16 years ago during the last few weeks of active alcoholism, before I had the moment of clarity that led to my recovery.
Active alcoholism was a series of contradictions for me. I would start almost every day determined not to drink, even though it had been literally years since I&#x27;d been alcohol-free for an entire 24 hours. I was never the kind of person to keep beer in the fridge for later or to maintain a bar so that I could m…</span>

                              <span>I did not think I would ever be spinning a blog again. I think I did in the, like, pre-Google Blogger days? Or something? I was 14. I thought everyone would follow it and I would be internet famous. I wish I could go back in time and kick my own ass.
This will not be a newsletter. I wanted to make one to have a more centralized &quot;here&#x27;s an important update&quot; kinda thing but that&#x27;s a) sort of what my Patreon is and b) if you collect enough emails, which I don&#x27;t think is unrealistic given my reach at this point, you need to start paying hundreds a month for that shit and, like, no. I will not.
So here&#x27;s a blog. How often will I post here? I don&#x27;t know! I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s actually kind of nice! I don&#x27;t need to give a shit about it. It&#x27;s a siloed area I can dump thoughts in and you can read them. Cohost taught me that I really don&#x27;t need to care about having a statement or take on shit, I can just post and have it immediately leave the aether, so this is what this is for. I also want to have a place to, like, make dev logs or something for comic stuff in the future!
Subscribe to the RSS in the navbar above or bookmark this, if you want.
If you&#x27;d like important updates, you can follow my Patreon for free and any major updates like shop updates, new merch, new site launches, etc. will be posted there and mailed to everyone like a newsletter.
Thanks for reading and if you&#x27;re coming from Cohost, thanks for being there while it was active. The community there was something I&#x27;ll cherish forever.</span>
