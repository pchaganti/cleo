                              <span>The recent Congressional hearings leading to a bloodbath of university presidents brings back memories from my teen-age years in the 1950s when everyone’s eyes were glued to the TV broadcast of the McCarthy hearings. And the student revolts incited by vicious college presidents trying to stifle academic freedom when it opposes foreign unjust wars awakens memories of the 1960s protests against the Vietnam War and the campus clampdowns confronting police violence. I was the junior member of the “Columbia three” alongside Seymour Melman and my mentor Terence McCarthy (both of whom taught at Columbia’s Seeley Mudd School of Industrial Engineering; my job was mainly to handle publicity and publication). At the end of that decade, students occupied my office and all others at the New School’s graduate faculty in New York City – very peacefully, without disturbing any of my books and papers. More

                              <span>The murder of the four students who protested the Vietnam War at Kent State University on May 1, 1970, was a tragedy.  The suppression of student protests on campuses across the United States in the spring of 2024 is a farce. The latter points to how little college administrators and politicians have learned when it comes to students&#x27; speech, thinking that repression is the solution for dissent and disagreement. More

                              <span>In school, many received a boring, whitewashed version of Mark Twain—a humorist of bottomless wit certainly, and comfortably critical of American slavery and racism, but without a more comprehensive anti-authoritarian worldview. Though the ideological underpinnings of his anti-imperialism have been debated, Twain clearly understood a relationship between monopoly capitalism and imperialism.[8] The anti-imperialism that was so important a part of his life and character has been blotted out because it is not a fit with the worldview of a decadent, out-of-touch American ruling class.

The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

                              <span>My wife is a librarian. The elephant in the room here is that patrons are shifting toward a preference for digital distribution. However, Fair Use has not caught up. So, libraries end up spending a large portion of their operating budget &quot;leasing&quot; ebooks from publishers at extraordinary markup over the print copies. These leases are only good for so many &quot;check outs&quot; -- often as few as 4-6 -- after which point, the lease must be renewed at a price that can be 2X or 3X the cost of the print book. It&#x27;s downright predatory.
IA may have gone beyond pushing the envelope and well into stepping over the line on this one, but it is an important legal challenge. I don&#x27;t think IA will or should win, but I do hope that their loss shifts the needle of public opinion a bit toward actual Fair Use.</span>

                              <span>The &quot;National Emergency Library&quot; was obviously a huge mistake, and I&#x27;m surprised that IA continues to defend it. The problem is, their online book lending is far from the most important part of the Internet Archive, and by continuing to fight for it, they risk losing everything, including the entire rest of the archive which seems to me to be far more important.
The Internet Archive has become the de-facto default location to upload anything rare, important, or valuable, and a terrifyingly large amount of history would suddenly blink from existence if it were brought down.</span>

                              <span>Accountants thought spreadsheets would kill their profession, instead demand for them exploded.
Compilers made it much easier to code compared to writing everything in Assembly. Python made it much easier to code than writing C. Both increased the demand for coders.
Code is a liability, not an asset. The fact that less technical people and people who are not trained engineers can now make useful apps by generating millions of lines of code is also only going to increase the need for professional software engineers.
If you&#x27;re doing an HTML or even React boot camp, I think you&#x27;d be right to be a bit concerned about your future.
If you&#x27;re studying algorithms and data structures and engineering best practices, I doubt you have anything to worry about.</span>

                              <span>A corollary to this may be that those who get many chances are more likely to succeed. This is often the case for people that have a safety net of some sort compared to those that don&#x27;t when it comes to, for example, starting businesses. Those with a safety net can fail and try again and again and eventually tell the story of how &#x27;gumption and spirit&#x27; made them a success while those that didn&#x27;t have a safety net &#x27;just didn&#x27;t try hard enough&#x27;. I know I have been exceptionally lucky in that I have been given many chances to fail, and taken them! Without those opportunities to fail safely I wouldn&#x27;t have the success I have now.</span>

                              <span>The first major piece of code that I ever wrote was a publishing workflow management system for a major newspaper. It routed page images to presses and generated pdfs of each page in each edition of the newspaper and made pdfs of each day&#x27;s newspaper editions and published them to a static website where they were archived.
I was only allowed to use perl 4 to write this software and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use a database, even though the datastructure for a day&#x27;s publishing batch had tens of thousands of keys and values and required RDBMs style queries. It also features a configurable postscript parser that extracts all kinds of data from completed newspaper pages that informs the publishing system. When I wrote it I was told that it would run for a few months only while we figured out how to get a $5M commercial product to handle the work.
The whole thing was written in perl 4 style OO Perl and came in at about 16k lines of code in the end -- most of the code was for the postscript processor and tons of cruft that I had to write to made a relational DBMS in memory because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use mysql. It took me four months to write it. I launched it in January of 2002 and it runs to this day. I know this because I got a call about it last month where my replacement&#x27;s replacement&#x27;s replacement asked me a few questions about what OO Perl is because he wanted to make a few changes. Good luck! It still runs and is responsbile for about 80% of what it was originally built to do. It is used by hundreds of people daily, who by all reports absolutely hate it. There are people working at the newspaper today that use it regularly that were not born when I wrote it. I am twice as old as I was when I wrote it.
They have apparently tried to replace it several times over the last 22 years and have failed to do so... this is likely due to the blockheadedness of my old boss (who is still there) as much as the radically insane obscurity of my code, which is exactly how you&#x27;d expect 16k lines of 22 year old OO Perl 4 would be.</span>

The middle class is awash in debt and fearful of the frightening levels of crime. More

These reforms facilitated an environment for the wealthy to profit from the less-affluent without repercussions.” More

                              <span>Here’s an anniversary no one wants to celebrate: The Columbine school shooting — April 20, 1999 — just passed its 25th anniversary. Fifteen dead (including the two shooters), 21 injured. A new era begins . . . Why, why, why bring up such a horrific event? Perhaps because it hasn’t stopped. Even though I sit  More

These clauses, which are now widely used, prohibit workers from working for another employer, or setting up their own business, for several years after quitting a job. These clauses are very common in employment contracts for veterinarians. I mention  More

                              <span>Last year a friend and I made a website about the Nurburgring. It provided basic info for first time visitors that we were missing on our first visit. My friend spent a lot of time creating a UI with a custom map for displaying locations and routes. I wrote a bunch of content that was thoroughly researched.
At a certain point we ended up being invited by one of the largest rental companies to see whether we could work together. They invited us because the content was incredibly useful for their visitors and they preferred our calendar over the official one for ease of use.
So clearly, our site was adding value for the target audience we had in mind. We were also consistently getting visitors through different search engines that were looking for the info we provided. The number of visitors was growing consistently and pretty much all the feedback we got was positive.
In March, Google rolled out a new algo which all but completely removed us from search results. Out visitors dropped about 80% and growth has disappeared. What was a fun project that we spent many hours on is now a waste of computing resources.
I hate that Google gatekeeps the internet.</span>

When I found the ingredients, they occupied a small squeezed sliver of the page. As I was counting the number of simultaneous ads surrounding the ingredient list (4 separate ads), a pop up covered them all and suggested I sign up for her newsletter.
The recipe looks good (chickpeas, olive oil, salt, spices, oh shit I stole her blog post). I also think the site counts as &quot;worthless blogspam&quot;.</span>

                              <span>With the exception of a brief period, India has been more fortunate than many other nations in being able to maintain parliamentary rule over the last 77 years. With 900 million voters—more than the populations of Europe and Australia put together—the Indian elections are hailed as the largest exhibition and celebration of democracy. The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

One of the two major-party candidates for the presidency of the United States has allowed an decades-long ethnic cleansing to morph into a genocide, a horror that could be stopped with one phone call; has escalated the drilling of oil and gas despite the existential threat of global warming; forced railroad workers to swallow a bad contract by breaking their strike; and spent his Senate career as an errand boy for banks. And that’s the lesser evil!
Joe Biden really is the lesser evil in this dismal race for the White House, and that such an office holder is easily not the worst candidate is surely sufficient to illustrate the decline of the world’s still extraordinarily dangerous superpower. Out of more than 300 million people, this is the best the country can do? Given the quite understandable reluctance (to put it mildly) for the types of folks who are reading these words to contemplate voting either for President Biden or Donald Trump, what do we do when the lesser evil is so evil that he has the sobriquet “Genocide” attached to his name?

It isn’t easy, being a liberal mainstream reporter these days, what with big news stories about “the Israel-Hamas war” passing you by, as you wrestle fecklessly with your two major journalistic goals: (a) to objectively document evil by exposing corruption; and (b) to keep your job and get everybody to like you. I’ve investigated pro-Palestine demonstrations on university campuses and never saw Jewish students “running for their lives,” as mainstream TV has reported; I’ve actually seen thousands of Jews standing up time and again for the right of Palestine to exist, but that hardly ever appears in mainstream news. And it’s hard for me, as a journalist or a civilian, to attend a public protest, or simply walk down the street wearing a Palestine t-shirt over my battered heart, knowing that I’m seen as a Jew-hater.

                              <span>The thing people love forgetting is a huge part of the iPhone success is based on the North American cellular comms industry being a trustless disaster area. The deal Apple did with AT&amp;T opened the floodgates.
Android was initially designed so that operators could customise it. The idea was apps were developed (and sold) only by operators, and everything else would be via the browser. If you had used a Nokia device in the EU in 2005 and then the exact same model in the customised form released on a US carrier you&#x27;d understand why this was such a terrible idea. The exclusion of carriers from being able to make modifications to the phone was, and remains, an active feature for end users.
People keep having to learn that developers cannot be trusted either, someone somewhere will always trend towards the very worst thing they can do, and you need look no further than this forum for the levels of avarice which have overrun the tech industry. The EU regulators live in a parallel universe where they&#x27;re all dependent on WhatsApp as they&#x27;ve never truly internalised that there is no such thing as a free lunch and that people see them as easy marks.</span>

Maybe the National Guard just wants their cut of the action…

                              <span>As a game developer for about two decades, I&#x27;ve never considered Rust to be a good programming language choice.
My priorities are reasonable performances and the fastest iteration time possible.
Gameplay code should be flexible, we have tons and tons of edge cases _by design_ because this is the best way to create interesting games.
Compilation time is very important, but also a flexible enough programming structure, moving things around and changing your mind about the most desirable approach several times a day is common during heavy development phases.
We almost never have specifications, almost nothing is set until the game is done.
It is a different story for game engines, renderers, physics, audio, asset loaders etc. those are much closer to system programming but this is also not where we usually spend the most time, as a professional you&#x27;re supposed to either use off-the-shelf engines or already made frameworks and libraries.
Also, ECS is, IMHO, a useful pattern for some systems, but it is a pain in the butt to use with gameplay or UI code.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s a good article. He&#x27;s right about many things.
I&#x27;ve been writing a metaverse client in Rust for several years now. Works with Second Life and Open Simulator servers. Here&#x27;s some video.[1] It&#x27;s about 45,000 lines of safe Rust.
Notes:
* There are very few people doing serious 3D game work in Rust. There&#x27;s Veloren, and my stuff, and maybe a few others. No big, popular titles. I&#x27;d expected some AAA title to be written in Rust by now. That hasn&#x27;t happened, and it&#x27;s probably not going to happen, for the reasons the author gives.
* He&#x27;s right about the pain of refactoring and the difficulties of interconnecting different parts of the program. It&#x27;s quite common for some change to require extensive plumbing work. If the client that talks to the servers needs to talk to the 2D GUI, it has to queue an event.
* The rendering situation is almost adequate, but the stack isn&#x27;t finished and reliable yet. The 2D GUI systems are weak and require too much code per dialog box.
* I tend to agree about the &quot;async contamination&quot; problem. The &quot;async&quot; system is optimized for someone who needs to run a very large web server, with a huge number of clients sending in requests. I&#x27;ve been pushing back against it creeping into areas that don&#x27;t really need it.
* I have less trouble with compile times than he does, because the metaverse client has no built-in &quot;gameplay&quot;. A metaverse client is more like a 3D web browser than a game.
All the objects and their behaviors come from the server.
I can edit my part of the world from inside the live world.  If the color or behavior or model of something needs to be changed, that&#x27;s not something that requires a client recompile.
The people using C# and Unity on the same problem are making much faster progress.

I fully understand username/email + password and remembering the pain of things like “app specific passwords” makes me worry that some tools (open source, cli, etc) might not integrate well with password less so it’s best to stay where I am until things settle out better.</span>

                              <span>The biggest issue with passkeys is that I just can&#x27;t trust the companies offering them. They are locked into the platform for reasons that are ostensibly security but often indistinguishable from platform lock-in. If you make a passkey on an Apple device as far as I can tell it will never leave that device, ever, and there is no way to change this. Of course this means you can never be phished for your credentials but if Apple decides to delete your key or you want to leave your iPhone behind, what are you supposed to do?</span>

                              <span>When I was nine years old, I liked poking around with a hex editor on my dad’s PC.
I didn’t speak English and MS-DOS wasn’t yet localized to Finnish in 1989, so I decided to try translating it myself with a dictionary by manually finding and replacing strings in the SYS/COM files. The result worked and my dad was suitably impressed, if probably a bit peeved that nothing worked anymore in the shell as expected (since I had replaced all the basic command names too — “dir” became “hak” and so on).
It’s pretty cool to see those strings again in src/MESSAGES.
At the same time, it feels a bit sad that today’s kids can’t get the same feeling that the computer is really theirs to modify. Modern operating systems don’t run binaries tampered with a hex editor. Most kids are on operating systems like iOS where they can’t even run a C compiler.
They can play with code in various sandboxes locally and on the web, but the computer fundamentally belongs to someone else today.</span>

                              <span>As an undergraduate at UC in the late 60s, I wondered why the name of one of the world’s greatest physicists who had worked there was absent, whereas that of his colleague, Ernest O. Lawrence, had been affixed to the sprawling Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and the Lawrence Hall of Science on the hill above campus as well as to the Lawrence National Laboratory in Livermore south of Berkeley.  A prestigious award and endowed lectureship also bore his name which features prominently in The Centennial Record of the University of California in contrast with that of Oppenheimer who gets scant mention.

                              <span>In the summer of 1968, I was assigned to the Central Intelligence Agency’s task force on the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.  The task force met around the clock in the CIA operations center, which was outfitted with myriad television screens.  Most of these screens were showing the Soviet invasion.  But several screens were devoted to the violence and mayhem on the streets of Chicago, where Mayor Richard Daley’s police force was pummeling young people holding a protest rally against the Vietnam War.  The chaos and the violence, which a federal commission labeled a “police riot,” played a key role in Richard Nixon’s narrow defeat of Hubert Humphrey in the election several months later.

Israel has been bombing Syria for years with no provocation or retaliation by Syria. For years it has bombed its airports which disrupted humanitarian aid to Syria’s civilian population who were suffering in its long civil war. Iran responded to the Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate by asking its allies, the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Hamas in Gaza, to refrain from their retaliatory strikes on Israel and let Iran make a military retaliation by itself. This was to ensure that Israel got the message. In the future, Iran will not rely on its proxies but will itself attack Israel. More

We identified four channels by which surplus value flows to the imperialist countries: currency (...)

Kubernetes v1.30 around authentication (finding out who&#x27;s performing a task,

Introduction
Kubernetes continues to evolve to meet the intricate requirements of system
administrators and developers alike. A critical aspect of Kubernetes that
ensures the security and integrity of the cluster is the API server
authorization. Until recently, the configuration of the authorization chain in
kube-apiserver was somewhat rigid, limited to a set of command-line flags and
allowing only a single webhook in th…</span>

                              <span>With Kubernetes 1.30, we (SIG Auth) are moving Structured Authentication Configuration to beta.
Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking
that they are who they say they are. Check back in tomorrow to find about what&#x27;s new in
Kubernetes v1.30 around authorization (deciding what someone can and can&#x27;t access).
Motivation
Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible
authentication system. The current system, while powerful, has some limitations
that make it difficult to use in certain scenarios. For example, it is not
possible to use multiple authenticators of the same type (e.g., multiple JWT
authenticators) or to change the configuration without restarting the API server. The

It seems like a pretty blatant way for airlines to keep customer&#x27;s money. Too bad this rule didn&#x27;t come sooner.</span>

Hopefully this will create a new wave off innovation, and someone will create something to replace the monopoly on IaC that IBM now owns.</span>

                              <span>The work &quot;ban&quot; is in scare quotes for a reason. The law doesn&#x27;t ban TikTok. Rather, it bans TikTok from having Chinese owners. If the law stands, the end result will likely be that TikTok will be sold to US owners, rather than TikTok going away.
It&#x27;s surprising to me that this this pretty significant distinction has been glossed over both in media reporting and in general comments here on HN.
To be clear, I&#x27;m not supporting the law with this comment, just clarifying what the actual content of the law is.</span>

                              <span>The Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank ended on Saturday 20 April 2024. As expected, there were no changes to the neoliberal policies promoted and imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions. A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

validating admission webhooks, it may be interesting to read our
previous post about the new feature.
If you have already heard about ValidatingAdmissionPolicies and you are eager to try them out,
there is no better time to do it than now.
Let&#x27;s have a taste of a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, by replacing a simple webhook.

First, let&#x27;s take a look at an example of a simple webhook. Here is an excerpt from a webhook that

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.
A container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls? What are their effects on the productive sector? In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>

full-fledged managed Kubernetes and run virtual Kubernetes clusters with just a click.
First up, let&#x27;s dive into the Cluster API.
Cluster API
Cluster API is an extension for Kubernetes that allows the management of Kubernetes clusters as
custom resources within another Kubernetes cluster.
The main goal of the Cluster API is to provide a unified interface for d…</span>

In the previous article, we
explained how we prepare a basic Kubernetes distribution based on Talos Linux and Flux CD.
In this article, we&#x27;ll show you a few various virtualization technologies in Kubernetes and prepare
everything need to run virtual machines in Kubernetes, primarily storage and networking.
We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let&#x27;s explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can&#x27;t you just use docker
containers for building cloud?
The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.
Although the situation improves year by year, we often encounter vulnerabilities that allow
escaping the container…</span>

                              <span>At Ænix, we have a deep affection for Kubernetes and dream that all modern technologies will soon
start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.
Why complicate things? - after all, …</span>

                              <span>As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase with climate change, insurance—the main tool for households and businesses to hedge natural disaster risks—becomes increasingly important. Can the insurance sector withstand the stress of climate change? To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers&#x27; exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.</span>

with Kubernetes 1.14 in 2019, the capability to run Windows workloads has been much
appreciated by the end user community. The level of and availability of Windows workload
support has consistently been a major differentiator for Kubernetes distributions used by
large enterprises. However, with more Windows workloads being migrated to Kubernetes
and new Windows features being continuously released, it became challenging to test
Windows worker nodes in an effective and standardized way.
The Kubernetes project values the ability to certify conformance without requiring a
closed-source license for a certified distribution or service that has no intention
of offering Windows.
Some notable examples brought to the attention of SIG Windows were:

                              <span>Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.</span>
