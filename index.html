                              <span>I correctly anticipated significant criticism of my last piece for CounterPunch, which argued that President Vladimir Putin’s was not “unproved,” that NATO expansion was a significant factor in the Russian use of force, and that our policymakers and so-called experts failed to understand the central national security aspects of Soviet/Russian policy.  Among the critics of my CounterPunch article were Walter Slocomb who served in Clinton’s national security council and lobbied for NATO expansion, and a former colleague of mine at the National War College, Marvin Ott, who supported expansion and is anticipating a Russian victory in Ukraine to be followed by Putin’s aggression elsewhere.

                              <span>There is a growing division in the U.S. between what seem to be almost irreconcilable opposites.  It is hard to see how that division will be resolved short of some kind of conflict. One can hope it will not be bloody, though the violent history of this country does not inspire confidence.

 Anarchists who want to take action, when confronted with the choice of tactics, often default to large mass actions, like black bloc. Imagination is ceded to tactical hegemony; autonomy diminishes; creativity recedes; resistance is franchised with stale, processed, prepackaged ideologies and tactics; questionable organizational methods like spokes-councils and democratic decision making give a participatory veneer to a sealed deal–just like in any liberal democracy; most participants spectate rather than act, learning by passive imitation of the leaders rather th…</span>

 As we are unfortunately repeatedly confronted with groups that support the Ukrainian side in the war between Russia and the Ukraine from an allegedly “anarchist” position, and as an article appeared in April (When ideology gets in the way of solidarity) in which ABC-Belarus was surprised that we described them as supporters of the war and therefore we did not invite them to the bookfair, here are a few words from us.

                              <span>Over the past week, I have enjoyed reading various Bear Blog blogs. It&#x27;s really interesting to see different viewpoints, and thoughts that are less filtered, and more raw. It reminds me of a simpler era of the internet before social media took over.
A recurring theme that has caught my attention - is mental health, various dealings, thoughts, struggles, and victories. All in all these blogs are written by different people at different points in their lives. Yet, they are connected by this platform on this corner of the internet.
Usually, there are not many interactions with the blog author. It’s just a thought written into the void. Nonetheless, I feel sometimes it’s important to show that somebody hears them. blogline by Robert actually inspired me to write this post.
Maybe an email or a simple upvote is all needed to show that you care?</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling weird about my blog recently. It&#x27;s a thoughtful place for me, but it&#x27;s also felt like a sort of put-on place, like I&#x27;m playing a specific version of myself, or like my site has developed a brand or style, which I&#x27;ve already mentioned not liking. So going into the next month of blogging, I have a new mantra: Let&#x27;s get weird with it. More mini-posts that are just for me, more experimental posts like this one, and a less bland CSS theme (I&#x27;ll be switching to Bear&#x27;s &quot;Plain HTML&quot; theme while I work on the new theme, sorry! It makes developing it easier). Idk what my goal is here, but I&#x27;m not gonna let myself be bored with my own blog, so here we go!</span>

                              <span>This post was inspired by Sit.
What is this?
I am bored. I want to get bored a bit more. Get bored with me. Come join.
The goal?
The goal of the challenge is to waste time. To be as unproductive. To &quot;bear the boredness&quot;. (I swear I could think of a better name)
You will need...
A timer (I use the iPhone built-in Clock app. Feel free to choose your own.)
A notebook / sheets of paper
A pen
How to get started:
Step 1: Decide on how long you want to get bored.
15-60 minutes. 5-12 sessions with each session 3-5 minutes long.
Step 2: Write down on your notebook a list of numbers from 1 to X. (X &#x3D; the number of sessions you chose). 
1.54:59 
Step 3: Start the timer, do nothing and get bored.
Step 4: When each session ends, think of one word that captures the theme of that session. It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective; an emotion, an action, some random vocabulary. Your choice! Write that word down next to the numbered list. 
1.54:59 Distraction 
That is all!
Note:
These are rules I follow when I am doing the challenge. Feel free not to.
No usage of pen and paper besides writing down the keyword. By all means think but let your thoughts slip. Do not write them down. The goal is to be unproductive.
Try not to doze off during the challenge.
Try not to engage in any other activities besides sitting or pacing. Pause the timer if you need to drink water or adjust your posture.
I have been trying this for a couple of days. Turns out getting bored for an hour is way harder than, say, focusing on a textbook and study for an hour. I want to post this to see if anyone is interested in such a format. Write me emails about what more I can do to get the most out of this challenge. Feel free to join me on this journey as well. Let me know if you do!</span>

                              <span>Recently, I stumbled across the Blaugust blogging challenge and thought it would be a good idea to participate. So I decided to join in.
&quot;Blaugust is a month-long event that takes place each August which focuses on blogging primarily and has started to include other forms of serialized content over the last several years. The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world. Posting regularly builds a community and in this era of AI-slop content, our voices are needed even more than we ever have been at any point in the past.&quot;

I hope that Blaugust will help me avoid thinking too much about writing...</span>

Between armed violence and fascism within the United States and the US government’s support for genocide abroad, manufacturers of weapons are profiting wildly. Within the US, arms producers are responsible for fueling war crimes in Gaza and mass shootings across the United States. The profit models of these companies are the same: more violence means more customers. Stoke the fear, fury, and legitimacy of conflict to sell more of your product. Generate a public culture receptive to the idea of weapons as the answer to insecurity, including through the construction and entrenchment of gender and racial power dynamics.
Profitmaking requires marketing. Enter the so-called militainment industry—the marketing of guns and militarism through films, television, video games, and now social media influencers. Gun manufacturers and military agencies, especially in the United States, have long had an outsized influence on the entertainment industry, and they use gendered and racialized tropes to promote gun sales along with a wider culture of militarism, war, and armed violence. But over the last two decades, the methods by which gun manufacturers and other military contractors have been able to influence people across many geographies—in particular young, white, cisgendered, heteronormative men—have become increasingly insidious. And the ramifications for violence are profound.

Many accused the GOP of attempting to impose a sanitized version of America’s […]

                              <span>Harris and Netanyahu meeting in the White House a day after Netanyahu’s bombastic address to Congress.
Netanyahu’s speech was a clarifying moment. Not for Netanyahu who needs no clarification. But for the US government. Its complicity in the genocide in Gaza and the wider apartheid in the Occupied Territories is absolute and openly celebrated by those who have funded and armed it.

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here to help :)
Before jumping into the implementation of tensors, we first need to understand what are tensors and how can we define them.
Tensors
What the hell do I mean when I say the word tensor? Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.
Imagine a number say,
$$
x &#x3D; 33
$$
This number $x$ is just a value and it is &quot;dimensionless&quot; i.e. we cannot attach any arrows to this number in the sense that tells us what this number is made up of. We call numbers like this Scalars. The dimensionality of a scalar is $0$.

Thinking about lost friendships. How one minute you&#x27;re saying i love you, and the next, they&#x27;re gone, and you&#x27;re left wondering what they&#x27;re doing with their time, and wishing you could to talk to them like it was the old days.

I typically look at my private/personal journal to do these weekly recaps but this week has been not so great that I didn’t have the energy to do much introspective writing.
Something happened at work this week that broke my heart and grateful at the same time. It’s such a contradictory feeling that has left me feeling torn and emotionally exhausted. It is continuing to happen and I’m just hoping I have the energy to endure all of it in the coming days.
I have a lot of things upcoming that I am absolutely dreading, but don’t have the power to change or control. For now, I am trying my best to put it aside and consider it a tomorrow/next week/next month problem. It’s causing me unnecessary stress, but I don’t know what else to do.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t written much on my blog in the last few weeks...
I&#x27;ve started some blog posts here and there but haven&#x27;t finished them. Or I simply didn&#x27;t publish them for various reasons.
Instead, I created a few slash pages, experimented with my site design, jotted down a few new ideas, read plenty of blog posts from the discovery feed and emailed with some wonderful Bear Blog bloggers.
And I had a lot of fun doing these things...
At first, it felt weird not to finish and publish any blog posts. It also caused me some anxiety. But blogging should be fun...
For me, Bear Blog is fun.
So instead of thinking too much about writing…
I enjoyed experimenting, reading and socializing on Bear Blog.</span>

Crime
 In “Criminal,” Isabelle Eberhardt&#x27;s memoir of land colonization in Algeria written around the turn of the last century, the farmer Mohammed Achouri cuts an interesting figure. A “tall thin old man with the face of an ascetic, his hard features set in an expression of constant preoccupation”, a quiet character who stands “a bit apart from the others”, he is not a likely hero.

His withdrawal won&#x27;t redeem his reputation, which will forever be stained by the mounds of dead Palestinian children he helped kill and showed no remorse for. More

                              <span>Like many people, my view of birdwatching (&quot;birding&quot;) and its practitioners were neutral at best, holding their stereotypical focal gear, donning vests and hats.
I learned that my friend casually did it on his walks and stuff, and was able to identify birds. That was cool, and made the hobby a bit more approachable for me.
It wasn&#x27;t until COVID when I saw a pair of cute yellow birds in the tree. Because the leaves haven&#x27;t grown in yet, I was able to watch them fly around the tree, landing in different spots, and ultimately move on to other spots. I was so mesmerized, I thought I had just seen a legendary pokemon. I immediately went to google, and found that it was an American Goldfinch.
It wasn&#x27;t really easy to find though. Google took me down an old-web looking site with the title &quot;Birds …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been feeling rather listless about coding recently. I briefly tried some things on a sideproject website of mine to get back into it, and it was like pulling teeth. I haven&#x27;t properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there&#x27;s more to it.
I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha. But what I specifically remembered is how I fell out of love with that too for a very similar feeling. I was making a dumpster in 3DS Max and I ran into the same bug over and ov…</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn&#x27;t gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I&#x27;m so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

                              <span>I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I&#x27;d make my own version of it
Here&#x27;s my anti-resume,
I don&#x27;t specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don&#x27;t follow clean code, I don&#x27;t follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don&#x27;t like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I do a lot of recreational coding. I don&#x27;t care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it&#x27;s beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don&#x27;t like using iterators over loops, I don&#x27;t do operator overloading, I don&#x27;t like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I&#x27;m starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don&#x27;t like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don&#x27;t like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I&#x27;m not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That&#x27;s it for now :)</span>

Dans mon article précédent, j’ai constaté un malaise :
de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle m’ont déçu.
Je suis parti en envolées lyriques.
Maintenant, j’ai envie d’agir.
J’ai déjà commencé, en réalité,
depuis plusieurs semaines.
J’expérimente des trucs.
J’en ré-applique d’autres que j’avais laissés de côté.
Dans mes prochains articles,
je vais probablement me concentrer à nouveau
sur du plus &quot;jeu de rôle&quot;.
Mais j&#x27;ai l&#x27;intuition que parler de créativité en général,
ça apporte aussi quelque chose.
Me contenter de parler &quot;techniques de jeu de rôle&quot;,
c&#x27;est comme brûler une étape.
Donc... Je vais encore parler de moi.

                              <span>Looks like since I started regularly updating this blog in June, there’s been 500 unique visitors and nearly a thousand reads. That’s kind of insane to me, I was pretty sure no one was going to read this thing, and I’m still not 100% sure why people do. I’m just some person!! I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!
Also, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.</span>
