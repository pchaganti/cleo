                              <span>Since I started blogging in January, I&#x27;ve invested time in several different communities, starting with OMG.LOL, followed by Microblog, Scribbles, r/MacApps, r/Obsidian, BearBlog, 500.social and the Blaugust Discord. The most personal of these are the Mastodon community around OMG.LOL, Scribbles and Microblog. The two Reddit communities are the most impersonal. As in any group environment, I have personal interactions with other people and with groups of other people. I also get to watch interactions where I&#x27;m not directly involved because of the way the Internet is structured.
Some of my rules are:
Stay out of other people&#x27;s fights
Never ignore racism, homophobia or misogyny
Never go &quot;Well, actually…&quot;
Give lots of complements
Offer sympathy
Answer questions
Avoid taking sides unless moral…</span>

After that, just do the cloud version of 1Password, which is easy to audit and manage access for, which you&#x27;ll thank yourself for when it comes time to SOC2.
Remember, as you give people access to passwords, that those passwords will need to be rotated when those people change to incompatible roles or depart the company. If passwords aren&#x27;t a total pain in the ass for you, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.</span>

                              <span>&gt; 10. What Changes When You Are Free
&gt; You will not be forced to work inside something known as a “virtual environment.”
Oof, this terrible advice cancels out an otherwise reasonable post. Beginners who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing are the last people who should be &#x60;pip install -r requirements.txt&#x60;-ing into the system Python the way this article is recommending. That&#x27;s not only going to make working on multiple projects nearly impossible (especially for the kind of beginning students who get recommended Anaconda, which are almost always the Data Science-y crowd using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit, etc, which are notoriously finicky with version conflicts), but it stands a good chance of breaking other Python-based system utilities in completely opaque ways. This sort of advice can fubar a naive user&#x27;s entire workflow.
I know virtualenvs suck to explain to people, but in my opinion it needs to be done before you ever tell them about &#x60;pip install&#x60;.</span>

                              <span>Key Ideas:
Heavier vehicles are safer for their occupants but more dangerous for others: The weight of a vehicle is a critical factor in car crashes, with heavier vehicles causing more fatalities in other cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
The heaviest vehicles kill more people than they save: Analysis of crash data shows that for every life saved by the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks, more than a dozen lives are lost in other vehicles.
Weight advantages have changed little over time: Despite improvements in safety features, the weight advantage of heavier vehicles has remained relatively constant, with heavier vehicles still causing more fatalities in lighter vehicles.
Carmakers prioritize consumer preferences over safety: Manufacturers are producing increasingly heavier vehicles, driven by consumer demand for larger, more powerful cars, despite the safety risks to others.
Regulators are ill-equipped to address the issue: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s rating system focuses on occupant safety, not the safety of other road users, and tax policies subsidize heavier vehicles.
Public awareness and concern are growing: Surveys show increasing concern about the size and safety of SUVs and pickup trucks, with researchers and policymakers starting to take notice.
Electrification may exacerbate the problem: The shift towards electric vehicles, which tend to be heavier than their internal-combustion equivalents, may increase the weight of vehicles on the road, further amplifying the safety risks.</span>

                              <span>I was once so angry that I reached this current level of understanding English, the level you see right now.
It was in the summer of 2016.
I wasn’t particularly angry at the time, until a certain event occurred. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.
During that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) and tried to read it.

                              <span>I wrote this 2 weeks ago while I was particularly sad about my situation and in a lot of pain; after keeping it in the drafts for a while to consider it, I felt like publishing it now because it&#x27;s easy to just portray the hopeful, productive ill person to the outside world, but sometimes accepting that stuff is tough!
I’ve been complaining about being ill sometimes, about specific symptoms, about being unable to do stuff and being stuck in bed so much.. and the response I seem to get (whether outright or implied) is like “Duh, you are chronically ill, of course this is happening.” Like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

Osa, a 13-year-old lab/pit mix had a swollen stomach and was moving around very gingerly. Her condition had not changed by this morning and he elected to take he to the emergency vet&#x27;s office in his neighborhood. The two of them were not gone long when he returned, grim faced. &quot;She&#x27;s dying&quot; he told me.
Osa survived the removal of stomach tumors three years ago. Now they have returned and in such profusion and size that removing them at her age isn&#x27;t a practical option. my granddaughte,r who lives in Virginia had an October trip already planned to come home for a visit with Osa, the family dog since she was in kindergarten.

                              <span>As students worldwide head back to school this fall, in Gaza, there are no schools left. The U.N. considers the systemic obliteration of the education system by the Israeli military to be a “scholasticide” — all universities, over 80% of schools, the Central Archives of Gaza, and at least 13 libraries have been destroyed, as of April 2024, in Israel’s relentless bombing campaign. Almost 10,000 students are dead and 16,000 wounded, many killed in attacks on schools being used as sites of refuge.
Academics and university administrators in Gaza released an open letter asking for solidarity and resistance from the rest of the world: “We call upon our colleagues in the homeland and internationally to support our steadfast attempts to defend and preserve our universities for the sake of the future of our people, and our ability to remain on our Palestinian land in Gaza. We built these universities from tents. And from tents, with the support of our friends, we will rebuild them once again.”
As a graduate student, an aspiring professor, and the child of a Jewish academic, I take this call for solidarity seriously. Where and how do we learn ideologies of resistance, radicalism, and revolution? Once we have inherited a radical idea, what do we do with it? And how do we choose what ideas not to inherit?

These days, I find myself in a strange place. Despite the Democrats’ miraculous replacement of Biden, Trump’s reelection remains distinctly possible. I studied authoritarianism for my master’s degree, and I strongly believe that a second Trump presidency would represent the end of American democracy. Yet even so, I find myself frequently tempted to dismiss commentators’ pleas as hyperbolic handwringing. I think I’m probably not alone in this confusing toggling between panic and blaséness. After some soul-searching, I think one of the reasons for the ever-present allure of complacency, other than the natural human tendency towards denial, is Trump’s humor.

Servers are holding up so far! Fortunately we were overprovisioned. If we hit 4mm new signups then things should get interesting. We did have some degradations (user handles entering an invalid state, event-stream crashed a couple times, algo crashed a couple times, image servers hit bad latencies) but we managed to avoid a full outage.
We use an event-sourcing model which is: K/V database for primary storage (actually sqlite), into a golang event stream, then into scylladb for computed views. Various separate services for search, algorithms, and images. Hybrid on-prem &amp; cloud. There are ~20 of the k/v servers, 1 event-stream, 2 scylla clusters (I believe).
The event-stream crash would cause the application to stop making progress on ingesting events, but we still got the writes, so you&#x27;d see eg likes failing to increment the counter but then magically taking effect 60 seconds later. Since the scylla cluster and the KV stores stayed online, we avoided a full outage.</span>

                              <span>The step-up in cost basis on death is the original sin that underpins the entire debate over unrealized gains.
It&#x27;s disheartening to see so much thought and deliberation going into an obviously toxic idea (taxing unrealized gains) when the obvious solution (removing the cost basis step-up when assets change hands) is being ignored.
Inherited wealth is the least earned, so it should be politically palatable to change this. But presumably because such a change would acutely affect the people who make laws in the country specifically, it is never seriously considered.</span>

                              <span>I worked for about a year with a consulting firm that handled &quot;Y2K compliance&quot;. Unlike this Andersen exercise in legal face-saving, it was a real job. Big companies hired us to do a full inventory of their site equipment (this included manufacturing plants, Pharma stuff) and go line by line with their vendors and figure out which components had known Y2K issues, which had not been tested at all, and which ones were fine/had simple fixes. We helped them replace and fix what needed to be fixed.
Y2K was a real problem. The end-of-the-world blackouts + planes falling from the sky was sensationalism, but there were real issues and most of them got fixed. Not trying to take away from this very interesting story of corrupt cronyism, but there were serious people dealing with serious problems out there. &quot;Remember Y2K? Nothing happened!&quot; is a super toxic lesson to take away from a rare success where people came together and fixed something instead of firefighting disasters.</span>

                              <span>Off course I knew what a blog was before finding Bear.1 I read blogposts and used tumblr (…), and I think my mother had a blog for some time, too. But I did not know about the technicalities (wtf is RSS?) and the culture of blogging. And although it took some time to set this whole endeavor up2, it is the culture-thing that is the hardest for me.
I am used to Twitter and Bluesky, where posts have to be short and draw attention. This combination rewards posts that say divisive shit3 and punishes those that are nuanced and complex. It is easier to wish death onto some asshole politician than to explain what they did wrong. If you want to write something personal or sincere you have to meme and/or bury it under ironic detachment.

                              <span>Happy World Blog Day!
In mid-July, I wanted to find a way to challenge myself in August for my birthday month. I initially wanted to do a photo challenge (a photo a day?) of sorts. As I was trying to figure out what to do, it was happenstance to have come across someone posting about Blaugust: A Festival of Blogging. I had no idea what it was but then I read this bit under What is Blaugust?:
The goal is to stoke the fires of creativity and allow bloggers and other content creators to mingle in a shared community while pushing each other to post more regularly. Above all the goal of Blaugust has always been to prove to folks that they can in fact sit down every day and create something fresh and then share it with the world.
I knew I just had to try it.
And here we are.

                              <span>TL;DR: Bearblog doesn&#x27;t (currently) strip location data from your uploads, so you need to do it yourself
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.
If you have posted images via the native bearblog insert image feature in the past, it is a good idea to check that your location hasn&#x27;t been inadvertently leaked.
Also, if you would like this to be solved for everyone, please help to upvote the suggestion to preprocess images.
EDIT: Herman has marked this suggestion as ‘planned’ ＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／
Thanks everyone for upvoting this issue!
Android
I&#x27;m not too sure how to this natively in Android (do let me know if you have an elegant way to remove location data!) - I&#x27;m wary to recommend any of the numerous apps that seem to do this, as I&#x27;m not sure which of them can be trusted.
EDIT: Jd dropped me an email recommending Aves (F-Droid|Github) for Android :-
Just saw your post and I was thinking to write the same a few days ago.
To remove metadata on your android phone, Aves is a really good gallery app. You can edit all of your metadata and also sort images in different ways.
It is available on playstore as well as fdroid.
Thanks for the recommendation! I haven&#x27;t been in touch with the Android ecosystem for a while, and it&#x27;s great to see photo/file manager apps which are not riddled with ads.
iOS
In the meantime, if you&#x27;re on iOS 17+, there is an option in the photo picker when inserting images, to remove location and resize the image:

                              <span>Have posted this before, but it really left an impression about crows, and the bond between their mates:
Years ago I was putting out the garbage in the back alley behind our building where I lived on the 8th floor. A crow attacked me out of the blue. Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me. Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building. That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me. It was a little spooky.
When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley. The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony. On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape. Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.
I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder. To this day it still amazes me that the crow&#x27;s mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Finally, I’d like to end this piece with a comment on the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand and I have held dear for years, and is still on our About page to this day, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o&#x27;clock-news reporting. It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers by providing high-quality content
That’s the core of it. And too bad they’re off. Finding a news outlet that isn’t “tweeting” an article and isn’t a blog post on HN was great. And while they mention Tom’s hardware. It always felt (to me) less verbose where I needed it.
Fair well.</span>

                              <span>Anandtech is how I learned what Ubuntu is. I must have been about 10 years old, and the concept of any OS besides Windows or MacOS was completely foreign to me. Within a few weeks, I had dug an old laptop out of my dad&#x27;s bin of &quot;stuff work wasn&#x27;t using anymore&quot; and I managed to put Ubuntu on it. I think it was an HP. I don&#x27;t remember the exact specs but I do remember that the GPU was failing, there were weird video glitches all the time, and the battery held a charge for about 15 minutes.
That was my first experience with Linux. That broken-ass computer was what I used when I learned Arduino. I&#x27;m now a firmware engineer, writing this comment on my work laptop, which is running Ubuntu.</span>

                              <span>Extremely sad. There basically is nothing like Anandtech; the depth, the ability to explain, the lack of sensationalism, and the integrity in benchmarking (I still vividly remember when they noticed an issue with HPET in Windows affecting their benchmarks, and promptly pulled all of them offline until they could reassess). Chips and Cheese is great but only covers a certain segment of it.
In the end, I would assume it just boiled down to lack of money. There were people among us who would gladly pay for this kind of coverage, but Anandtech said at some point they had considered it and couldn&#x27;t find a good model. (As an aside, I pay for LWN, and I would pay for something that covered similar areas to Phoronix but actually was good.)</span>

                              <span>Earlier today I was reading some new posts by Visa. There’s not much to say about that, except that he uses pretty normal words and writes very well.
This might seem like an odd comment, but it stems from my reading of another post, A Brief Case on Bearblog. The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.
This thought reminded me of an excellent essay by Paul Graham, Write Like You Talk. In it, he argues that if you want people to connect with you, you must write in a way that feels familiar to them. Essentially, the essay rests on the assumption that we all speak similarly but think differently.

                              <span>A month ago, I decided to shut down this blog. The next day I changed my mind, which I wrote about in the post &quot;The blog that refuses to die.&quot;
Yesterday, I launched a membership called Birming Buddies. When I woke up this morning after a long and good night&#x27;s sleep, I realized it didn&#x27;t feel right. I have now removed the page.
It probably sounds crazy – and maybe it is.
But neither the decision to start Birming Buddies nor to shut down the blog were impulsive actions. It&#x27;s always been a long period of consideration before I hit the OK button. Once I&#x27;ve done that, I quickly realize whether it was the right decision or not.
It&#x27;s as if I can&#x27;t reason my way through some decisions. I have to put them into action to really be able to determine what is right and what is not. Not very practical, I know, but that&#x27;s apparently how I work.
Anyway, no harm done. The member fees are  refunded and the blog lives on. And I&#x27;ll continue to develop the Bearming theme. Today I released an add-on to show excerpts of your blog posts (see example on my home page), and a new color palette named Green Screen.
I hope you have the patience to continue following my rather crooked blog journey. Hopefully, the transparency will bring some comfort to those who can relate.
By the way, I also launched a newsletter today. Subscribe now, who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll delete it tomorrow ;)
I wish you a wonderful weekend!</span>

                              <span>Ruby has a surprising hack in its interpreter. If the file starts with a shebang line, ruby will skip all lines until it encounters a shebang line which contains the string &quot;ruby&quot; in it.
This lets you start out as a shell script and then after some setup switch over to ruby
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

There is some ugliness to this hack though. The interpreter only looks for the word &quot;ruby&quot; so the shebang line could be whatever including.
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/I/am/a/rubyist
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

will work but
#!/bin/bash

rvm use 3.3.4

exec ruby $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;

#!/bin/rb
puts &quot;I run in ruby&quot;

will result in a print of &quot;no Ruby script found in input&quot;
Source: ruby.c#L2681
I am not a fan of such hacks in a language. Python lets you do something similar too - but it takes advantage of the fact that triple-quoted strings are side-effect free in Python and &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;: is the same as just a : which is two empty strings followed by a true in bash.
#!/bin/bash
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;:
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate.sh

exec python $0 &quot;$@&quot;

echo &quot;I am a bash line too but I will never run&quot;
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;

print(&quot;I am in python&quot;)</span>

                              <span>There is no greater strategic madness than the belief that nuclear superiority must be maintained at each rung of the nuclear ladder in order to maintain deterrence.  U.S. weapons technology was a major driver of escalation dominance throughout the 1950s and 1960s along with the belief that the Soviet Union would move to a level of nuclear conflict that the United States could not counter.  “Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb” parodied these fears, and the arms control and disarmament developments of the 1970s and 1980s helped to defuse them.  Sadly, the Biden administration has taken a step that suggests a return to escalation dominance, which will spiral a Pentagon budget that will soon reach $1 trillion per year.

                              <span>Since 2007, when the State of Israel implemented its still-ongoing blockade of Gaza, several different monikers have emerged to describe the conditions for Palestinians living in the territory under the ongoing Israeli siege.  Now, after 11 months of the murderous Israeli assault on the people of Gaza, it is necessary once again to revise what the State of Israel has imposed on the territory.  What the state of Israel has created in the Gaza Strip is nothing less than a death camp akin to what the Nazis created for the massacre of Jews and other so-called enemies of the Reich.

                              <span>I don’t know. Reading this made me tear up a bit. I learned software engineering when I was in junior high school. I learned it because I sucked at math, and I want to write  programs that solve my homework. Then I continue writing LAN chat, HTTP server, Anti Virus, and a lot more things just because it was fun to do.
It was fun, it was challenging, it was rewarding, it was amazing.
Now that I’m working, with the endless stream of new technologies, the debates of X considered harmful, J is better than K, and a barrage of never ending new things. It started to numb my mind.
Somehow, those joyful feeling of engineering no longer feels like the blue sky. I think its still blue, but for an eye washed in silvers, everything looks gray.
Reading this story somehow light up that childhood feeling of me learning software engineering. It can still be fun. I can still write things for the sake of me and not for the sake of exit nor a new shiny SaaS.
Thank your for writing this. It gave me a ray of hope that it can still be fun.</span>

But expect most of the exhibits to be buildings, living quarters, offices etc. and mundane descriptions of day-to-day life there, not exhibits about the technical/cryptological aspects (although they do have some of those too).
If you&#x27;re interested in computer history and Bombe/Colossus, visit the much lesser known National Museum of Computing at the same site. https://www.tnmoc.org/
I spent way too much time at the the boring parts of Bletchley Park and as a result didn&#x27;t have enough time for the Museum of Computing.
I&#x27;d recommend starting at the Museum of Computing, then if you have time left, the 1-2 buildings inside the official Bletchley Park museum that have the crypto exhibits.</span>

  * More than anything, I think it&#x27;s good for things to end! I figured interest in the site would die off over time (and it started to), and I thought it was better to close things out providing a special experience for the people that used it than to keep it up to get a few more users
  * Costs started adding up; donations stopped matching them. I coulda figured out how to lower my costs but I wasn&#x27;t excited about it.
  * While the site was up I felt an obligation to make sure someone hadn&#x27;t found some trivial workaround to deface the thing and I didn&#x27;t want to do that anymore.

I&#x27;m very pro ephemeral stuff! So I feel good about the decision. But it&#x27;s a good question.</span>

this is my favorite story from running the site, and possibly the best story I&#x27;ve ever been a part of. I&#x27;m not a big crier but I have cried so many times thinking and trying to write about it over the past 2 months. And of course, the process of discovery (and going from panic to excitement) was pretty crazy too.
One of my favorite things about this is that it validated one of the core beliefs I have when making these things - that you need constraints for the small group of people that are jerks, but that for the most part those constraints are fodder for the largely-good and very creative folks that play around on the internet.
Happy to answer any questions folks have!</span>

                              <span>I spend four months of the year traveling in an RV. Two years ago, I budgeted over $6000 for my desired solar setup (at least 1200Ah of battery, at least 2400W of solar, plus various controllers and other components). It was expensive enough for me to hold off, and more importantly, I didn&#x27;t have the space on my current RV for the solar panels.
In just the two years since then, prices on batteries and panels have dropped 25% or more, and solar power per square foot at a good price point has gone up significantly (400W monocrystalline panels can be gotten for $200, in the same form factor as the 200W panels I had been budgeting for). I&#x27;ve now lowered my budget to $4000 for the same setup I was planning to spend $6000 on two years ago, and with 400W panels, I no longer need to upgrade to a l…</span>

The article mentions that FlyCASS seems to be run by one person. This isn&#x27;t a matter of technical chops, this is a matter of someone who is good at navigating bureaucracy convincing the powers that be that they should have a special hook into the system.
What should really be investigated is who on the government side approved and vetted the initial FlyCASS proposal and subsequent development? And why, as something with a special hook into airline security infrastructure, was it never security audited?</span>

It is really telling that they try to cover up and deny instead of fix it, but not surprising. That is a natural consequence of authoritarian thinking, which is the entire premise and culture of the TSA. Any institution that covers up and ignores existential risks instead of confronting them head on will eventually implode by consequences of its own negligence- which hopefully will happen to the TSA.</span>

                              <span>The current comments seem to say this is rings the death knell of social media and that this just leads to government censorship. I&#x27;m not so sure.
I think the ultimate problem is that social media is not unbiased — it curates what people are shown. In that role they are no longer an impartial party merely hosting content. It seems this ruling is saying that the curation being algorithmic does not absolve the companies from liability.
In a very general sense, this ruling could be seen as a form of net neutrality. Currently social media platforms favor certain content, while down weighting others. Sure, it might be at a different level than peer agreements between ISPs and websites, but it amounts to a similar phenomenon when most people interact on social media through the feed.
Honestly, I think I&#x27;d love to see what changes this ruling brings about. HN is quite literally the only social media site (loosely interpreted) I even have an account on anymore, mainly because of how truly awful all the sites have become. Maybe this will make social media more palatable again? Maybe not, but I&#x27;m inclined to see what shakes out.</span>

One of my self-sabotaging behavior is my occasional inability to set boundaries, specifically when it comes to my personal time and work.
I rarely take days off from work. I know that it’s a problem because I have maxed out my vacation accrual days (like now) during several occasions. When I do take the time off from work, I still check my messages in case there’s something on fire and I need to fix it. I also have my notifications on in the evenings, because some of my co-workers also don’t have boundaries when it comes to work, and will ping me because they too are working late.
I know, it’s bad.
This time around, very in line with my Do Not Disturb mentality, I decided to turn my Slack messages and work email notifications off during my time off.
It worked out so well. I mostly didn’t think about work. I didn’t see any messages that needed my attention right away. I didn’t have to think about the things I need to solve for my team during my time off. I had a clear separation of me enjoying my time off, and work that stresses me out more than it should.
Because of this, I decided to make this separation a little bit more permanent. I’m going to actually turn my (work) notifications off when it’s time to log off, so that I’m not unintentionally working during the evenings. We’ll see if this pans out.
Just the little things to get my mental health sorted out.

 If, for any number of reasons, you’d like to burn telecoms to the ground and build a new internet service provider on their smoldering remains, good news for you. New York City Spectrum workers, who’ve weathered an anguishing four-year strike, have built their own internet service provider. If the city throws its support behind it, People’s Choice Communications could liberate New Yorkers from cable gangsters once and for all. 
 The city itself is almost constantly fighting Spectrum. With its rise to dominance in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tried to evict it; attorneys general had to chase it around for allegedly defrauding…</span>

 My name is Kostya, I am a student of the second grade. [Kostya lives in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine.] 
How did you experience the beginning of the war?
 In fact, I sensed that a full-scale invasion would soon occur, but I did not expect it to be so large and destructive. I remember the beginning very well. My mother asked me to buy food, which was practically non-existent, and told me to stay at home. The first week was very scary, nobody knew what was going to happen.

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …</span>

 For most contemporaries, Michail Bakunin is unknown. If a certain number of people only know him by name, that is enough to hate and slander him. But there are some who love him with fervour. 
 Once Bakunin was truly a great name. While one would search in vain in the edition of the great encyclopedic dictionary published in 1866 for the name of Karl Marx, tha…</span>

Today marks the first anniversary of your passing. Not a day goes... eeh, what’s that you said?
&quot;I know, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in.&quot;
Haha! Your sense of humor is intact. That&#x27;s still one of the first things people mention when your name comes up: your wonderful sense of humor, and how incredibly kind you were.
You truly treated everyone with the same care and respect.
I still remember the incident in the garden from when I was little. A drug addict had wandered in and fallen asleep there. Mom and all of us kids stood at a safe distance, nervously watching as you helped him. Before staggering off, he turned around with tears of gratitude and asked:
&quot;Are you a priest?&quot;
That’s the kind of person you were. A helping hand and a life saver. A true hero.
As you know, your other son turns 50 today. But this day is not about birth or death. It’s a day of celebration and love. A day of unity, no matter the realm of residence.
Thank you for the long and wonderful time you gave us. Thank you for all the lovely memories that keep your spirit alive. Thank you for all the beautiful things you passed on to us.
I&#x27;ll end with your last words:
I love you!</span>

                              <span>We’re finally back home.
I’ve had a really good few days (since Friday) break. We did a lot in a relatively short amount of time.
So many indicators of a memorable time.
Tan lines in random places to indicate getting that much needed Vitamin D.
Photographs that froze time to be remembered and printed.
(Enamel) Pins added to my collection of places visited.
Stickers. All of the stickers, even though pins have replaced that obsession.
A couple of library cards to show that even during vacation, I still think about all of the books to be read in the future.
Memories of full bellies because we ate a lot of really yummy food.
I’m still processing everything. I’ll be posting all of the photos in the future, whether it be on here, or on the photoblog.
Last day of my very short “vacation” today.
I woke up this morning after having dreamt of work, with tears in my eyes. Is it respectable for me to throw a tantrum to show that I really don’t want to go back to work tomorrow?
Probably not. For today, I’m going to try really hard to just not think about it.
Vacation is not over until it’s over.

                              <span>I read a lot. Probably more than a lot of people, but still not as much as some.
When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it&#x27;s just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less as an adult. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn&#x27;t unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library&#x27;s entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with just one local library card. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I&#x27;m a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards &#x3D; even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.
