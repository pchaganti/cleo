                              <span>I’ve avoided passkeys so far because I just don’t have a good mental model of them. All my passwords are randomly generate and stored in a password manager so I really haven’t felt the need to switch or felt constrained by my existing set up.
I fully understand username/email + password and remembering the pain of things like “app specific passwords” makes me worry that some tools (open source, cli, etc) might not integrate well with password less so it’s best to stay where I am until things settle out better.</span>

                              <span>The biggest issue with passkeys is that I just can&#x27;t trust the companies offering them. They are locked into the platform for reasons that are ostensibly security but often indistinguishable from platform lock-in. If you make a passkey on an Apple device as far as I can tell it will never leave that device, ever, and there is no way to change this. Of course this means you can never be phished for your credentials but if Apple decides to delete your key or you want to leave your iPhone behind, what are you supposed to do?</span>

                              <span>When I was nine years old, I liked poking around with a hex editor on my dad’s PC.
I didn’t speak English and MS-DOS wasn’t yet localized to Finnish in 1989, so I decided to try translating it myself with a dictionary by manually finding and replacing strings in the SYS/COM files. The result worked and my dad was suitably impressed, if probably a bit peeved that nothing worked anymore in the shell as expected (since I had replaced all the basic command names too — “dir” became “hak” and so on).
It’s pretty cool to see those strings again in src/MESSAGES.
At the same time, it feels a bit sad that today’s kids can’t get the same feeling that the computer is really theirs to modify. Modern operating systems don’t run binaries tampered with a hex editor. Most kids are on operating systems like iOS where they can’t even run a C compiler.
They can play with code in various sandboxes locally and on the web, but the computer fundamentally belongs to someone else today.</span>

Lawrence, had been affixed to the sprawling Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and the Lawrence Hall of Science on the hill above campus as well as to the Lawrence National Laboratory in Livermore south of Berkeley.  A prestigious award and endowed lectureship also bore his name which features prominently in The Centennial Record of the University of California in contrast with that of Oppenheimer who gets scant mention.

                              <span>In striking at the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1 Bibi Netanyahu has made himself an April Fool. Israel has been bombing Syria for years with no provocation or retaliation by Syria. For years it has bombed its airports which disrupted humanitarian aid to Syria’s civilian population who were suffering in its long civil war. Iran responded to the Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate by asking its allies, the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Hamas in Gaza, to refrain from their retaliatory strikes on Israel and let Iran make a military retaliation by itself. This was to ensure that Israel got the message. In the future, Iran will not rely on its proxies but will itself attack Israel. More

Kubernetes v1.30 around authentication (finding out who&#x27;s performing a task,

Introduction
Kubernetes continues to evolve to meet the intricate requirements of system
administrators and developers alike. A critical aspect of Kubernetes that
ensures the security and integrity of the cluster is the API server
authorization. Until recently, the configuration of the authorization chain in
kube-apiserver was somewhat rigid, limited to a set of command-line flags and

Because it isn&#x27;t an election year issue. This has been in the works since at least 2022.https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/net-neutrality-will-make-...
The rule making process takes time!
&gt;From my perspective, nothing about the internet changed since then (my experience did not upgrade or downgrade). People stopped talking about it, there weren&#x27;t major protests, news about it even largely disappeared from the front page of HN (!).   ...  What, then, is the impetus for restoring the net neutrality rules, given there is always some political cost to any action like this? Has the lack of net neutrality caused issues that I just have not heard about?
IMO it seems likely ISPs knew the rules were likely to come back so they avoided most of the practices that would generate outrage (throttling streaming and other popular services unless you pay an additional fee). I have no doubt if they could get away with it they would haha. Many providers did roll out zero rating programs.
As for why this is important just because ISPs aren&#x27;t currently doing it on a large scale doesn&#x27;t mean steps shouldn&#x27;t be taken to prohibit it. We already know what happens in the long run when ISPs are allowed to double dip https://restofworld.org/2024/south-korea-twitch-exit-problem...</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m happy this reversal occurred, but I am exhausted by the continuous flip-flopping of legislation depending on which party is in charge. Feels like we&#x27;re stagnating as a nation by going in a circle rather than finding commonality to go forward.
Maybe it&#x27;s always been this way though and I&#x27;m just getting old enough to be bothered by it?</span>

                              <span>The use of Tribler was problematic in my case because it uses a random torrent cache that was instrumentalized for lawfare after a political problem with my public employer in Spain. I was accused of having pedophile content on my computer after the prosecution&#x27;s expert selected the corresponding torrents and downloaded them. It seems there are always pedophile torrents in a random sample of torrents.
The political problem was that I refused to alter statistical data for a &quot;scientist&quot; that wanted to publish that women after abortion develop mental health issues. They search my job computer for something to kill me and found tribler cache.
https://www.publico.es/actualidad/rioja-paga-estudios-salud-...
It was hard. Lost job, six years under juditial prosecution... at the end, the case was dismissed, I could show that the torrent cache was not personal, but the damage was great.
Be careful if you are an activist or have political involvement. I&#x27;m unaware of the workings of the current version, hope it encrypts the torrent cache somehow.</span>

It&#x27;s a good idea to spell out abbreviations the first time they&#x27;re used, especially since the abbreviation itself is not used in the linked article. It&#x27;s also worth noting that the proposal is about US infrastructure as a service (IaaS) products specifically, not &quot;internet services&quot; in general.</span>

                              <span>The problem here isn&#x27;t with the concept of Streams (which are good) but with specifically the &quot;buffered stream&quot; APIs provided by the futures crate (i.e. the buffered and buffer_unordered methods). Their lack of concurrency with processing before or after is a known problem as the blog post alludes to at the end; I would discourage users from using these APIs without considerable care.
I&#x27;ve explored this subject on my blog, including possible solutions to the problem with these APIs:

                              <span>Comments about the marketing driven nm measurements aside, this still looks like another solid advance for TSMC. They are already significantly ahead of Samsung and Intel on transistor density. TSMC is at 197 MTr/mm2 wile Samsung is at 150 MTr/mm2 and Intel is at 123 MTr/mm2. This 1.6nm process will put them around 230 MTr/mm2 by 2026. When viewed by this metric, Intel is really falling behind.</span>

                              <span>ELI5:
ICs are manufactured on silicon disks called wafers. Discs have two sides, and traditionally, everything was done on top. We can now do power on the bottom. This makes things go faster and use less power:
* Power wires are big (and can be a bit crude). The bigger the better. Signal wires are small and precise. Smaller is generally better.
* Big wires, if near signal wires, can interfere with them working optimally (called &quot;capacitance&quot;).
* Capacitance can slow down signals on the fine signal wires.
* Capacitance also increases power usage when ones become zeros and vice-versa on signal wires.
* Big wires also take up a lot of space.
* Putting them on the back of the wafer means that things can go faster and use less power, since you don&#x27;t have big power wires near your fine signal wires.
* Putting them in back leaves a lot more space for things in front.
* Capacitance between power wires (which don&#x27;t carry signal) actually helps deliver cleaner power too, which is a free bonus!
This is hard to do, since it means somehow routing power through the wafer. That&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t do this before. You need very tiny wires through very tiny holes in locations very precisely aligned on both sides. Aligning things on the scale of nanometers is very, very hard.
How did I do?</span>

                              <span>With Kubernetes 1.30, we (SIG Auth) are moving Structured Authentication Configuration to beta.
Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking
that they are who they say they are. Check back in tomorrow to find about what&#x27;s new in
Kubernetes v1.30 around authorization (deciding what someone can and can&#x27;t access).
Motivation
Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible
authentication system. The current system, while powerful, has some limitations
that make it difficult to use in certain scenarios. For example, it is not
possible to use multiple authenticators of the same type (e.g., multiple JWT
authenticators) or to change the configuration without restarting the API server. The

It seems like a pretty blatant way for airlines to keep customer&#x27;s money. Too bad this rule didn&#x27;t come sooner.</span>

Hopefully this will create a new wave off innovation, and someone will create something to replace the monopoly on IaC that IBM now owns.</span>

It&#x27;s surprising to me that this this pretty significant distinction has been glossed over both in media reporting and in general comments here on HN.
To be clear, I&#x27;m not supporting the law with this comment, just clarifying what the actual content of the law is.</span>

                              <span>Wow, 128 experts in a single model. That&#x27;s a lot more than everyone else. The Snowflake team has a blog post explaining why they did that:
https://www.snowflake.com/blog/arctic-open-efficient-foundat...
But the most interesting aspect about this, for  me, is that every tech company seems to be coming out with a free open model claiming to be better than the others at this thing or that thing. The number of choices is overwhelming. As of right now, Huggingface is hosting over 600,000 different pretrained open models.
Lots of money has been forever burned training or finetuning all those open models. Even more money has been forever burned training or finetuning all the models that have not been publicly released. It&#x27;s like a giant bonfire, with Nvidia supplying most of the (very expensive) chopped wood.
Who&#x27;s going to recoup all that investment? When? How? What&#x27;s the rationale for releasing all these models to the public? Do all these tech companies know something we don&#x27;t? Why are they doing this?

EDIT: Changed &quot;0.6 million&quot; to &quot;600,000,&quot; which seems clearer. Added &quot;or finetuning&quot;.</span>

                              <span>It’s true that sometimes an outsider can offer a fresh perspective. From where you sit, there might be a solution you can’t see. The nearest exit might be in the row behind you.
Maybe this applies more often when the one giving advice has more experience than the one receiving it, or when the person who is stuck has habituated a narrow perspective or some form of learned helplessness.
But I recoil at something I think I see more often, which is when several people stand around pointing out the obvious and congratulating each other on their fresh ideas and wondering what’s so hard for the guy who has lived the situation and would love to find a way forward if there were the right resources or the right change in policies or the right change in politics. The peanut gallery loses interest pretty quickly when faced with questions about the real constraints and it turns out their answers are not fresh at all.
But now we have someone who’s “marinating in the stuck,” surrounded by people who still agree with each other that they know how it should all be done but have now also been embarrassed.
It’s an ugly, toxic cycle that bottoms out at everyone constantly having their knowledge and competence questioned over things they know and can do, by people who don’t and can’t.
If someone is stuck, ask if you can help, sure. Ask what seems to be the trouble. Ask what has been tried so far. But maybe don’t lead with your advice.</span>

                              <span>I think one should attribute a good amount of credit of this to Yann LeCun (head of meta&#x27;s research). From early stage he have been vocal about keeping things open-source, and voiced that to Mark before even joining. (and credit to Mark for keeping that).
It probably also stems from his experience working at Bell Labs, and how his pioneering work very much required a lot of help from things available openly, as is still the case in academia.
The man have been repeating the advantage of open-source being the better option, and been very vocal about his opposition to &quot;regulate AI (read: let a handful of US government aligned closed-source companies have complete monopoly on AI under the guise of ethics)&quot;. On this point he (and meta) stands in a pretty stark contrast to a lot of big-tech AI mainstream voices.
Me myself recently moved some research tech stack to meta stuff, and unlike platform that basically stops being supported as soon as the main contributor finishes his PhD, it have been great to work on it (and they&#x27;re usually open to feedback and fixes/PR).</span>

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

Do export controls induce a selective decoupling of the targeted goods and sectors? How do global customer-supplier relations react to export controls?

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
Madhav Jivrajani (MJ): Hello! My name is Madhav Jivrajani, I serve as a technical lead for SIG
Contributor Experience and a GitHub Admin for the Kubernetes project. Apart from that I also
contribute to SIG API Machinery and SIG Etcd, but more recently, I’ve been helping out with the work

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let&#x27;s explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can&#x27;t you just use docker
containers for building cloud?
The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.

start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.
Why complicate things? - after all, …</span>

To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers&#x27; exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.</span>

                              <span>Overdraft credit, when banks and credit unions allow customers to spend more than their checking account holds, has many critics. One fundamental concern is whether overdrafts are salient—whether account holders know how often they overdraw and how much it costs them. To shed light on this question, we asked participants in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations about their experience with and knowledge of their banks’ overdraft programs. The large majority knew how often they overdrew their account and by how much. Their overdraft experience, we find, begets knowledge; of respondents who overdrew their account in the previous year, 84 percent knew the fee they were charged, roughly twice the share for other respondents. However, even experienced overdrafters were relatively unaware of other overdraft terms and practices, such as the maximum overdraft allowed or whether their financial institution processed larger transactions first.</span>
