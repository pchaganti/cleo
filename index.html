                              <span>The Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
acts as the main connection between the kubelet
and the Container Runtime.
Those runtimes have to provide a gRPC server which has to

This API definition

Google is failing, so users start putting &quot;Reddit&quot; on the ends of their search results. Where do we go when Reddit is no longer useful and contains the same AI generated dreck as all the Google search results? It shows how many single points of failure there are on the informational web. Pretty much the only informational resource on the web that&#x27;s still unscathed is Wikipedia (thanks herculean-level efforts by its editors, mind you), but I wouldn&#x27;t bank on it in the same way I wouldn&#x27;t bank on Reddit.

- first callout was OTR longhauls.  Musk clearly didnt want his trucks stuck as lot-tenders where they would work brilliantly, he wanted publicity on the road.
- longhauls cancelled because obvious infrastructure limitations.  batteries and motors failing more frequently due to the load and the range.  reports of using tesla consumer vehicle components in the drivetrain.  switch to regional routes
- regional routes failing between AZ/CA due to thermal and performance issues.  range issues.

                              <span>Performance analysis indicates that SQLite spends very little time doing bytecode decoding and dispatch.  Most CPU cycles are consumed in walking B-Trees, doing value comparisons, and decoding records - all of which happens in compiled C code.  Bytecode dispatch is using less than 3% of the total CPU time, according to my measurements.
So at least in the case of SQLite, compiling all the way down to machine code might provide a performance boost 3% or less.  That&#x27;s not very much, considering the size, complexity, and portability costs involved.
A key point to keep in mind is that SQLite bytecodes tend to be very high-level (create a B-Tree cursor, position a B-Tree cursor, extract a specific column from a record, etc).  You might have had prior experience with bytecode that is lower level (add two numbers, move a value from one memory location to another, jump if the result is non-zero, etc).  The ratio of bytecode overhead to actual work done is much higher with low-level bytecode.  SQLite also does these kinds of low-level bytecodes, but most of its time is spent inside of high-level bytecodes, where the bytecode overhead is negligible compared to the amount of work being done.</span>

I was surprised to receive a reply from you, the author. Thank you :)
Since I&#x27;m a novice with both compilers and databases, could you tell me what the advantages and disadvantages are of using a VM with SQLite?

It is difficult to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of byte-code versus AST for SQL in a tweet.  I need to write a new page on this topic for the SQLite documentation.  Please remind me if something does not appear in about a week.</span>

                              <span>The recent Congressional hearings leading to a bloodbath of university presidents brings back memories from my teen-age years in the 1950s when everyone’s eyes were glued to the TV broadcast of the McCarthy hearings. And the student revolts incited by vicious college presidents trying to stifle academic freedom when it opposes foreign unjust wars awakens memories of the 1960s protests against the Vietnam War and the campus clampdowns confronting police violence. I was the junior member of the “Columbia three” alongside Seymour Melman and my mentor Terence McCarthy (both of whom taught at Columbia’s Seeley Mudd School of Industrial Engineering; my job was mainly to handle publicity and publication). At the end of that decade, students occupied my office and all others at the New School’s graduate faculty in New York City – very peacefully, without disturbing any of my books and papers. More

The latter points to how little college administrators and politicians have learned when it comes to students&#x27; speech, thinking that repression is the solution for dissent and disagreement. More

Though the ideological underpinnings of his anti-imperialism have been debated, Twain clearly understood a relationship between monopoly capitalism and imperialism.[8] The anti-imperialism that was so important a part of his life and character has been blotted out because it is not a fit with the worldview of a decadent, out-of-touch American ruling class.

of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

                              <span>You already noticed the technical card [1], but I can describe some of the details that go into this for those unfamiliar with the items on it.
1. The scope they used is roughly equivalent to shooting with an 800mm telephoto lens. But the fact that it&#x27;s 8&quot; wide means it can let in a lot of light.
2. The camera [2] is a cooled monochrome camera. Sensor heat is a major source of noise, so the idea is to cool the sensor to -10deg (C) to reduce that noise. Shooting in mono allows you shoot each color channel separately, with filters that correspond to the precise wavelengths of light that are dominant in the object you&#x27;re shooting and ideally minimize wavelengths present in light pollution or the moon. Monochrome also allows you to make use of the full sensor rather than splitting the light up…</span>

                              <span>I once bought a far larger supercomputer. It was 1/8 (roughly) of ASCI Blue Mountain. 72 racks. Commissioned in 1998 as #1 or #2 on the TOP500, officially decommissioned in 2004, purchased my 1/8 for $7k in ~2005.
Moving 72 racks was NOT easy. After paying substantial storage fees, I rented a 1500sf warehouse after selling off a few of them and they filled it up. Took a while to get 220V/30A service in there to run just one of them for testing purposes. Installing IRIX was 10x worse than any other OS. Imagine 8 CD&#x27;s and you had to put them each in 2x during the process. Luckily somebody listed a set on eBay. SGI was either already defunct or just very unfriendly to second hand owners like myself.
The racks ran SGI Origin 2000s with CRAYlink interlinks. Sold &#x27;em off 1-8 at a time, mainly to render farms. Toy Story had been made on similar hardware. The original NFL broadcasts with that magic yellow first down line were synthesized with similar hardware. One customer did the opening credits for a movie with one of my units.
I remember still having half of them around when Bitcoin first came out. It never occurred to me to try to mine with them, though I suspect if I&#x27;d been able to provide sufficient electrical service for the remainder, Satoshi and I would&#x27;ve been neck-and-neck for number of bitcoins in our respective wallets.
The whole exercise was probably worthwhile. I learned a lot, even if it does feel like seven lifetimes ago.</span>

                              <span>My wife is a librarian. The elephant in the room here is that patrons are shifting toward a preference for digital distribution. However, Fair Use has not caught up. So, libraries end up spending a large portion of their operating budget &quot;leasing&quot; ebooks from publishers at extraordinary markup over the print copies. These leases are only good for so many &quot;check outs&quot; -- often as few as 4-6 -- after which point, the lease must be renewed at a price that can be 2X or 3X the cost of the print book. It&#x27;s downright predatory.
IA may have gone beyond pushing the envelope and well into stepping over the line on this one, but it is an important legal challenge. I don&#x27;t think IA will or should win, but I do hope that their loss shifts the needle of public opinion a bit toward actual Fair Use.</span>

                              <span>Man, its knowledge is insane.
I run a dying forum. I first prompted with &quot;Who is  at ?&quot; and it gave me a very endearing, weirdly knowledgeable bio of myself and my contributions to the forum including various innovations I made in the space back in the day. It summarized my role on my own forum better than I could have ever written it.
And then I asked &quot;who are other notable users at &quot; and it gave me a list of some mods but also stand out users. It knew the types of posts they wrote and the subforums they spent time in. And without a single hallucination.</span>

The problem is, their online book lending is far from the most important part of the Internet Archive, and by continuing to fight for it, they risk losing everything, including the entire rest of the archive which seems to me to be far more important.
The Internet Archive has become the de-facto default location to upload anything rare, important, or valuable, and a terrifyingly large amount of history would suddenly blink from existence if it were brought down.</span>

                              <span>Accountants thought spreadsheets would kill their profession, instead demand for them exploded.
Compilers made it much easier to code compared to writing everything in Assembly. Python made it much easier to code than writing C. Both increased the demand for coders.
Code is a liability, not an asset. The fact that less technical people and people who are not trained engineers can now make useful apps by generating millions of lines of code is also only going to increase the need for professional software engineers.
If you&#x27;re doing an HTML or even React boot camp, I think you&#x27;d be right to be a bit concerned about your future.
If you&#x27;re studying algorithms and data structures and engineering best practices, I doubt you have anything to worry about.</span>

Then, a couple years later, I needed something to watch during long exercise sessions and I checked it out again. It was getting much more interesting by the end of the first season.
And every season got better and richer. By the very end, I experienced it as actually deep, especially in the way the Keri Russell character unexpectedly evolves. It was a real pleasure and I&#x27;m very glad I had the chance to enjoy it. Recommended!</span>

The 5.6PF you quote for 18 A100&#x27;s would be in BF16.  Not comparable.
The A100 can only do 9.746 TFLOPS in FP64.
So you would need 548 A100&#x27;s to match the FP64 performance of the Cheyenne.</span>

                              <span>A corollary to this may be that those who get many chances are more likely to succeed. This is often the case for people that have a safety net of some sort compared to those that don&#x27;t when it comes to, for example, starting businesses. Those with a safety net can fail and try again and again and eventually tell the story of how &#x27;gumption and spirit&#x27; made them a success while those that didn&#x27;t have a safety net &#x27;just didn&#x27;t try hard enough&#x27;.

                              <span>The first major piece of code that I ever wrote was a publishing workflow management system for a major newspaper. It routed page images to presses and generated pdfs of each page in each edition of the newspaper and made pdfs of each day&#x27;s newspaper editions and published them to a static website where they were archived.
I was only allowed to use perl 4 to write this software and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use a database, even though the datastructure for a day&#x27;s publishing batch had tens of thousands of keys and values and required RDBMs style queries. It also features a configurable postscript parser that extracts all kinds of data from completed newspaper pages that informs the publishing system. When I wrote it I was told that it would run for a few months only while we figured out how to get a $5M commercial product to handle the work.
The whole thing was written in perl 4 style OO Perl and came in at about 16k lines of code in the end -- most of the code was for the postscript processor and tons of cruft that I had to write to made a relational DBMS in memory because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to use mysql. It took me four months to write it. I launched it in January of 2002 and it runs to this day. I know this because I got a call about it last month where my replacement&#x27;s replacement&#x27;s replacement asked me a few questions about what OO Perl is because he wanted to make a few changes. Good luck! It still runs and is responsbile for about 80% of what it was originally built to do. It is used by hundreds of people daily, who by all reports absolutely hate it. There are people working at the newspaper today that use it regularly that were not born when I wrote it. I am twice as old as I was when I wrote it.
They have apparently tried to replace it several times over the last 22 years and have failed to do so... this is likely due to the blockheadedness of my old boss (who is still there) as much as the radically insane obscurity of my code, which is exactly how you&#x27;d expect 16k lines of 22 year old OO Perl 4 would be.</span>

For many of us our lives are fundamentally different to those of our parents and we enjoy opportunities and lifestyles of which they could only dream. But today even the black middle classes are disillusioned. The collapse of public services and infrastructure means that education, health care, security, electricity and now even water are increasingly privately sourced by those with the means placing even well-paid professionals under severe financial stress. The middle class is awash in debt and fearful of the frightening levels of crime. More

These reforms facilitated an environment for the wealthy to profit from the less-affluent without repercussions.” More

The prisoners-of-war were tired hiding their lathe every time they might be searched, that they hung up a sign &quot;workshop&quot; above one of their huts, and timed it so that the new round of guards thought it had always been there.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s important to recognize that life is path-dependent. But as a counter-point, worrying too much about each decision as a potential mistake can lead to the kind of fear-based paralysis described by Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar:
&quot;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn&#x27;t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&#x27;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I think the primary point here is that interruptions don&#x27;t only happen externally, but also internally. I think this point is a bit obscured by the article&#x27;s use of this &quot;fragmented thinking&quot; terminology, which it does not do a good job of defining before building an argument on top of it. (I found myself searching for those words to see if I had missed the definition.)
However, I do think this is an insightful point! I think these &quot;internal interruptions&quot; are indeed a big problem for me, and one I don&#x27;t think about nearly as much, but will try to more now that I&#x27;ve read this article.
The frustrating thing about external interruptions is the inability to control them. Things like turning off notifications and putting on headphones are mechanisms to reduce that frustration by imposing control over those interruptions.
The good news for these internal interruptions is that it should be much easier to control them. But it requires being aware of the problem! So I&#x27;m thankful to this article for making this more top of mind for me.</span>

                              <span>With the exception of a brief period, India has been more fortunate than many other nations in being able to maintain parliamentary rule over the last 77 years. With 900 million voters—more than the populations of Europe and Australia put together—the Indian elections are hailed as the largest exhibition and celebration of democracy. The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

Introduction
Kubernetes continues to evolve to meet the intricate requirements of system

kube-apiserver was somewhat rigid, limited to a set of command-line flags and
allowing only a single webhook in th…</span>

Motivation
Kubernetes has had a long-standing need for a more flexible and extensible
authentication system. The current system, while powerful, has some limitations
that make it difficult to use in certain scenarios. For example, it is not

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

                              <span>Linux provides different namespaces to isolate processes from each other. For
example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.
A container breakout is when a process inside a container can break out

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>

We will talk about technologies such as KubeVirt, LINSTOR, and Kube-OVN.
But first, let&#x27;s explain what virtual machines are needed for, and why can&#x27;t you just use docker
containers for building cloud?
The reason is that containers do not provide a sufficient level of isolation.

start utilizing its remarkable patterns.
Have you ever thought about building your own cloud? I bet you have. But is it possible to do this
using only modern technologies and approaches, without leaving the cozy Kubernetes ecosystem?
Our experience in developing Cozystack required us to delve deeply into it.
You might argue that Kubernetes is not intended for this purpose and why not simply use OpenStack
for bare metal servers and run Kubernetes inside it as intended. But by doing so, you would simply
shift the responsibility from your hands to the hands of OpenStack administrators.
This would add at least one more huge and complex system to your ecosystem.
Why complicate things? - after all, …</span>

To answer this question, it is necessary to first understand insurers&#x27; exposure to physical climate risk, that is, risks coming from physical manifestations of climate change, such as natural disasters. In this post, based on our recent staff report, we construct a novel factor to measure the aggregate physical climate risk in the financial market and discuss its applications, including the assessment of insurers’ exposure to climate risk and the expected capital shortfall of insurers under climate stress scenarios.</span>
