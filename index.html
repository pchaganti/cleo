In this post, we consider the systemic implications of the observed build-up of bank-NBFI connections associated with the growth of NBFIs.</span>

                              <span>I understand the concern that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that will escape its bounds and threaten humanity. That is a risk.
My bigger, and more pressing worry, is that a &quot;superintelligence&quot; will emerge that does not escape its bounds, and the question will be which humans control it. Look no further than history to see what happens when humans acquire great power. The &quot;cold war&quot; nuclear arms race, which brought the world to the brink of (at least partial) annihilation, is a good recent example.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? -- That is my biggest concern.
Update: I&#x27;m not as worried about Ilya et al as commercial companies (including formerly &quot;open&quot; OpenAI) discovering AGI.</span>

                              <span>Maybe they have saved enough from working in tech that they can grow vegetables for themselves in a very low scale way. Its nice to escape from the career you&#x27;ve had for decades. Sometimes its not even an escape from the career, but the career and the city you&#x27;ve lived in. Moving to the forest and growing some vegetables and raising chickens isn&#x27;t that difficult. You certainly don&#x27;t need &quot;millions in equipment&quot;. Its exactly what I did.
I found it difficult to get a job in tech at the start of COVID after working in it for ~25 years. I moved to Michigan, and now live in the woods. My Cost of Living is a fraction of what it was. My mortgage is only 80% of what I was paying for rent in the SFBay area. Its peaceful and quiet here. It actually gets dark too. I no longer hear BART screeching on the rails at 2am or the constant flow of traffic. I.. do once again work in tech though at a much &#x27;smaller&#x27; scale. My company is small and work demands don&#x27;t dominate my life. I have balance.
This year I&#x27;ve planted ~200 onions, ~100 potatoes, ~100 garlic, ~60 strawberry. I have blueberry from a few years back starting to flourish. I have wild blackberry, and mushrooms galore. &quot;touching grass&quot; is a daily activity as we manage our small flock of chickens.</span>

                              <span>Every time this topic comes up I say the same thing. If you&#x27;ve never worked on a farm and have some kind of romantic idea about it then you shouldn&#x27;t do this. Farming is hard work. Modern farmers have college degrees, millions in equipment, and a vast amount of knowledge and experience you do not have.
If you&#x27;re thinking of doing this and do not have experience go work on a farm for a year before you buy in.</span>

Also, it&#x27;s completely not obvious from your web pages which features already work in your OS. And, IMHO, Discord is definitely not &quot;the perfect place to connect, collaborate, and contribute&quot;.

                              <span>I like a lot of the answers, but something else I&#x27;d add: lots of &quot;popular&quot; architectures from the late 00s and early 2010s have fallen by the wayside because people realized &quot;You&#x27;re not Google. Your company will never be Google.&quot;
That is, there was a big desire around that time period to &quot;build it how the big successful companies built it.&quot; But since then, a lot of us have realized that complexity isn&#x27;t necessary for 99% of companies. When you couple that with hardware and standard databases getting much better, there are just fewer and fewer companies who need all of these &quot;scalability tricks&quot;.
My bar for &quot;Is there a reason we can&#x27;t just do this all in Postgres?&quot; is much, much higher than it was a decade ago.</span>

The water was cold. I&#x27;d gone from pulling my pants up to my knees to tying them around my thighs as each breaking wave called me further and further out. I played tag with the tide, kicked up sand as I avoided getting wet from the waist up, spat out salt, laughed with my friend. He chased a pink rubber clog into the retreating tide for me, which prompted us to deposit our belongings further away from the water line.
How far we&#x27;d come, adding depth to a hole we chanced upon to chasing the glittering horizon.
My friend is 5&#x27;8&quot; to my 5&#x27;1&quot;, and though the half-foot height difference made for good j…</span>

An hour later, after I had parked my car and started to walk home, the sky immediately opened up. It came down like the rainy season in Asia, causing everyone to run for cover.
In a way, it was a nice little break. A moment of reflection. I started to think about the changes in life...
How quickly a moment can change completely. Well, I was lucky to be hit by rain and not a car, but it could have been me in one of those vehicles.
As I finished the last job of the day, I decided to wait to go home to prepare for tomorrow&#x27;s job. Who knows, maybe those minutes were life-changing for me. I will never know.
It doesn&#x27;t hurt to remind ourselves from time to time of the changes in life, its fragility and unpredictability. Not in a resigned way, but in gratitude for what we have.</span>

                              <span>Juneteenth is named after June 19, 1865, when news of their emancipation reached enslaved people in Texas. None of the pundits who are commenting on the holiday ask why enslaved people were in Texas in the first place.  General Antonio López de Santa Anna, who fought Texas enslavers at the Alamo in 1836, is depicted in settler school books as a villain. No. Santa Anna was opposed to slavery. He found the practice disgusting. The defenders of the Alamo, some of whom ran away, were pro-slavery. More

 In issue 215 of Black Flag we ran a critique of the politics of Green Anarchist, “Irrationalism — Steve Booth Against the Machine”, which attacked propositions by Steve Booth (in Green Anarchist 51) in favour of “acts of intense violence against the system with no obvious motives, no pattern”. Booth stated that:

Title: My Own Pearl Harbor
Date: Dec 7, 2022
Source: medium.com/@danielmcgowannyc

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning. And like that, the past had caught up with…</span>

 The award-winning documentary, If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front, premiered at Sundance last spring and continues to screen in theaters across the globe. The film, which aired on PBS earlier this fall and is now available on DVD, details the events that led to the imprisonment of environmental activist Daniel McGowan and raises critical questions about ecological crisis, terrorism, and government repression of political activists. 
 Those who see If A Tree Falls are likely to be left with a number of lingering questions. How is Daniel doing now? When will he be re…</span>

Date: May 9th, 2022

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides.

1. PRELIMINARY NOTES
 The Houthis attacks on cargo ships, the USA/UK strikes against Yemen, the USA/EU naval fleet deployed in the Red Sea, the ISIS-K Crocus City Hall attack[1], the Iran/Israel missile attacks[2] constitute new expressions of the emerging global reality: competing groups/blocks of capitalists have chosen the route of war, in order to establish themselves in a better position within the hierarchies of a globalised economy that is in stagnation, and is also dealing with the exhausti…</span>

Ashanti: First thing, first thing, first thing... Power to the people. 
Audience: silence
Ashanti: Oh! Wait a minute... First thing, first thing, first thing... Power to the people. 
Audience: Power to the people! 
Ashanti: Oh my God, I&#x27;m like, whoa... And what we usually say when someone says power to the people, the response is; all power to the people! Alright, so I give you the first one. Yeah, I mean, that&#x27;s OK, &#x27;cause I was practiced, right? 
 But all power means that all power goes to the people, right? Didn&#x27;t say to the party. Didn&#x27;t say to the state. It didn&#x27;t say to the slick talkers. Not other ones. To the people, to the pe…</span>

Nos piden desde el principio un régimen perfecto, garantía de que las cosas se harán así y no de este otro modo, sin coscorrones, sin tanteos. Si hubiéramos de aprender a vivirlo, no terminaríamos nunca el aprendizaje. Ni el niño aprendería a andar, ni el chico montaría en bicicleta, ni sería posible adquirir un oficio o una especialización. Al contrario, en la vida se hacen al revés las cosas.

Title: On Eugene O’Neill’s “Philosophical Anarchism”
Date: 2007
Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. 

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…</span>

                              <span>I have long maintained that the NIH should set aside 25% of its budget to fund spot checking of the research output of the remaining 75% of funded research. Even if this funding is only sufficient to review a handful of papers each year, it stands to have a transformative effect on the level of hype and p-hacking in many fields, and could nearly eliminate the rare cases of actual fraud. It would also improve the overall quality and reliability of the literature too.</span>

If the creators read this, I suggest some ways of building trust. There’s no “about us”, no GitHub link, etc. It’s a random webpage that wants my personal details, and sends me a “exe”. The overlap of people who understand what this tool does, and people who would run that “exe” is pretty small.</span>

                              <span>There seems to be a perception in big companies that if you&#x27;re not pissing off your customers enough to drive them away, you&#x27;re leaving money on the table. So there&#x27;s this constant pseudo-optimizer running to get the maximum profit possible.

                              <span>Visited a new cafe. A very cozy place. The aroma made it impossible to resist getting something good to go with the coffee.
The walls were decorated with plants and art. One of the pictures caught my eye. It said:
Always be a little kinder than necessary.
Wise words! And so simple. A free gesture that can brighten someone&#x27;s day.
A little smile. A thumbs up. A &quot;tell the chef the food was delicious&quot;.
We don&#x27;t need to exaggerate. We don&#x27;t have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.
But we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.
If we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.

                              <span>In our previous post, we documented the significant growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) over the past decade, but also argued for and showed evidence of NBFIs’ dependence on banks for funding and liquidity support. In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.</span>

Edison built the first commercial electricity-generating power station in New York in 1882, while Insull designed how to monetize the juice from an ever-growing supply. Add in the ability today to buy and sell to others along an internet-enabled, “bi-directional” grid, however, and we could soon be embarking on the next big thing or an unregulated free-for-all with everyday customers holding the bag.

That gap has become a cause for global concern as well. CEO-worker pay gaps in the United States, as data in a new Altrata report make clear, are essentially cementing in  More

Title: On Organization
Date: 1954
Notes: Translated from the Italian-language article in ‘L’Adunata dei Refrattari’, June 19, 1954, New York City and Newark. A partial English translation previously appeared in ‘Resistance: An Anarchist Bi-Monthly‘, August-October 1954, New York City, but this is a new and complete translation

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…</span>

Title: The Armed Nation
Date: 1902
Notes: Translated by Andrea Asali, from “‘La nazione armata,’” La Rivoluzione Sociale (London), no. 4 (November 15, 1902), published in ‘The Complete Works of Malatesta, Vol. V, The Armed Strike: The Long London Exile of 1900–13′ (2023), edited by Davide Turcato, who notes that &quot;In the debate on how the army should be structured, a debate that has accompanied the history of unified Italy, the &#x27;armed nation&#x27; was the model that federalist and democratic forces opposed to that of the permanent army at the sovereign’s service. Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…</span>

Ryan&#x27;s work is legitimately interesting and novel &quot;LLM reasoning&quot; research! The core idea:
&gt; get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s)
Roughly, he&#x27;s implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we&#x27;d love to see more of.
A couple important notes:
1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $).
2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn&#x27;t been validated or scrutinized yet.
All said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We&#x27;ll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard
EDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this</span>

this isn&#x27;t much of a feature upgrade, but we took the opportunity to clean up a few things and drop IE support, which will help us slim down the library over time
hopefully it&#x27;s an easy upgrade for most htmx users, upgrade guide is here:

I can only assume the ultimate cause is the individual motivations of executives and managers. &quot;Oooo, if we raise subscriptions $10/mo, we&#x27;ll make lots of money, and it&#x27;ll look really good on my annual review.&quot; &quot;Oooo, this cancellation fee will really help our retention, which will look really good on my annual review.&quot; &quot;Making Photoshop subscription only will do amazing things for our revenue.&quot;
When you have complete market dominance, you have little opportunity for growth. If your employees and investors have an insatiable need for growth, you have to try anyway, and that&#x27;s where things fall apart. The #1 threat to your magical money faucet is something replacing your product as the photo editor of choice, and you should be 100% focused on making sure that doesn&#x27;t happen. To do that, you need to be focused on keeping up quality, periodically adding the latest features, and making absolutely sure that the next generation of artists is coming up using your tool.
That Adobe rep 25 years ago was 100% correct, but &quot;I keep the money pipe flowing and did not actively make it worse&quot; does not get you a promotion.</span>

                              <span>I remember doing laser cooling of rubidium atoms in physics class. It&#x27;s really cool how it works:
* Rubidium will absorb photons of a certain wavelength and re-emit it in a random direction. Since photons have momentum, it will get some net momentum change from absorbing photons all coming from a particular direction, but the re-emissions are in random directions so they have net zero momentum.
* Shine laser light at it from all directions but at a wavelength slightly longer than the wavelength at which it will absorb. Now, if the rubidium atom is moving, the light hitting it head on will be Doppler shifted into the wavelength that it absorbs, slowing it down, whereas the other light wouldn&#x27;t affect it. So, no matter how it is moving, it will slow down.
Rubidium is a good material since it has an S shell on the outside as though it were a big hydrogen atom, but it is so massive that it is a lot nicer to work with for this application.</span>

                              <span>When creative cloud was very first released, it was excellent value. I was actually quite supportive of Adobe&#x27;s initial SaaS strategy. It was well and truly a &quot;why would anyone ever pirate photoshop ever again?&quot; type of product.
Fast forward a decade and that $19.99/mo product has become $89.99/mo and the value prop has plummeted on top of it. The big difference today is that instead of people returning to the high seas and continuing to use adobe software, they are just moving to different ecosystems -- procreate, davinci, foxit, etc.</span>

                              <span>About 25 years ago, working at one of those dot com bubble internet consultancy firms, I was told by an Adobe rep that they knew everyone at home had a pirated copy of their software but the company view was that they thought that was a good thing. It meant people learnt their software at home and then insisted on using it at work, where it would be a paid for license.
It seems their attitudes changed soon after, perhaps due to their almost total market dominance, and they became aggressive towards their users in the pursuit of profits. The last Adobe software I really used was Lightroom as that was one of the last pay-once software titles. Now the only Adobe product most of us at work have is except Acrobat Reader. We were quite glad when the Figma purchase failed.</span>

                              <span>“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they&#x27;re working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.

                              <span>Because the Bantu languages (most prominently: Swahili) and Japanese have similar sound systems.   Finnish is also oddly similar-sounding, or Hawaiian.  None of them are actually related.
It&#x27;s because the syllable is restricted in the number of possible forms, in a similar way.  (And they all have approximately five vowels.  And a pitch accent.)  In Hawaiian, nothing but consonant + vowel syllables are possible.  Swahili and Japanese allow an optional final n sound.  Finnish is a little more flexible, and syllables can end with an n, r, l or t.  No consonant clusters, in any of the languages.  No syllables ending with consonants outside the restricted set (if any), in any of the languages.
This results in a lot of syllables of the form: i, a, ne, na, ka, ta, po, to...  &quot;Pokatokaino&quot;.  I just made that up and it&#x27;s probably not a Swahili, Finnish, Hawaiian, or Japanese word -- but it could be.
This basic pattern (consonant + vowel + maybe limited option for final consonant) is very common; it&#x27;s the most common arrangement among the worlds languages.   Far more common than languages like English which allow monstrosities like &quot;strengths&quot; (which is 6 consonants and one vowel).</span>

                              <span>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that there was a decent size, but small market for SBCs for low-volume embedded work (including hobbyists) before Raspberry Pi. You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.
Broadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.
5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).</span>

                              <span>&gt; Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.
What&#x27;s always been funny to me about the scientific approach to animal consciousness/emotions/empathy is that in a perfectly rational world the default assumption would be that animals and humans exist along a spectrum and there isn&#x27;t a sharp cliff where humans are 100% conscious and empathetic but dogs are 0%. The claim that humans are categorically different than other animals is the extraordinary one, not the claim that we are made of mostly the same stuff.
The only reason why animal consciousness has been controversial historically is a religious one—the Bible has typically been read as placing humanity in a category of its own. And yet we see countless secular scientists clinging to that perspective when even a cursory glance at the evidence and a basic application of Occam&#x27;s razor would suggest the opposite.</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s because RaspberryPis are no longer cheap throw away computers meant for education or hobbyists, they&#x27;re developer kits for manufacturers that need a CPU running a well supported mainline Linux in their products.
The only reason they don&#x27;t cost $500 or more is because the foundation needs the hobbyist market to write and support the open source BSP, without which the RPi would be just another poorly supported also-ran in an already crowded market. With how well supported mainline Linux is on the Pi, EEs would be willing to pay a lot more.</span>

                              <span>I self-host a (non-critical) mail server and a few other things and occasionally look at live firewall logs, seeing the constant flow of illegitimate traffic hitting random ports all over the place, some hitting legitimate service ports but others just probing basically anything and everything. I decided to setup a series of scripts that detect activity on ports that aren&#x27;t open (and therefore there&#x27;s no legitimate reason for the traffic to exist) and block those IP addresses from the service ports since the traffic source isn&#x27;t to be trusted.
Something that came out of analysis of the blocked IP addresses was that I discovered a few untrustworthy /24 networks belonging to a bunch of &quot;internet security companies&quot; whose core business seems to depend on flooding the entire IPv4 space with daily scans. Blocking these Internet scanner networks significantly reduced the uninvited activity on my open service ports. And by significantly I mean easily over 50% of unwanted traffic is blocked.
Network lists and various scripts to achieve my setup can be found here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity
Internet Scanner lists are here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
Large networks that seem responsible for more than their fair share of uninvited activity are listed here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
I&#x27;m semi-aware of the futility of blocking IP addresses and networks. I do believe, however, that it can significantly reduce the load on the next layers of security that require computation for pattern matching etc.
Be aware: there are footguns to be found here.</span>

Surviving a loved one’s death can only be personal and subjective. We all react differently, we all perceive differently, we all emote differently. Some feel the loss more keenly than others, some not so much. But one thing you can be sure of is, the loss of a loved one changes you no matter what your relationship was till that point.
I lost my father to lung cancer in 1991, he was only 68 years of age. His ‘illness’ was slow, debilitating, terrifying and painful right through till the last few weeks when, being cared for in our local hospice, my father passed quietly, almost peacefully after his (and yes, our) two year ordeal.

                              <span>In the last decade Tech has become part of the establishment. They are one of the dominant controlling forces.
The blackout was _not_ about preserving free speech, or any other moral high road.  It was purely about control. Tech hadn’t yet cemented their position as a dominant player and didn’t want to cede the control they had.
Now that they’ve embedded themselves in the ruling class they don’t care as much because they already have control.</span>

Interesting that now that France actually does it, they say they will comply.

                              <span>There are two different questions at play here, and we need to be careful what we wish for.
The first concern is the most legitimate one: can I stop an LLM from training itself on my data? This should be possible and Perplexity should absolutely make it easy to block them from training.
The second concern, though, is can Perplexity do a live web query to my website and present data from my website in a format that the user asks for? Arguing that we should ban this moves into very dangerous territory.
Everything from ad blockers to reader mode to screen readers do exactly the same thing that Perplexity is doing here, with the only difference being that they tend to be exclusively local. The very nature of a &quot;user agent&quot; is to be an automated tool that manipulates content hosted on the internet according to the specifications given to the tool by the user. I have a hard time seeing an argument against Perplexity using this data in this way that wouldn&#x27;t apply equally to countless tools that we already all use and which companies try with varying degrees of success to block.
I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where website owners can use DRM to force me to display their website in exactly the way that their designers envisioned it. I want to be able to write scripts to manipulate the page and present it in a way that&#x27;s useful for me. I don&#x27;t currently use llms this way, but I&#x27;m uncomfortable with arguing that it&#x27;s unethical for them to do that so long as they&#x27;re citing the source.</span>

                              <span>The author has misunderstood when the perplexity user agent applies.
Web site owners shouldn’t dictate what browser users can access their site with - whether that’s chrome, firefox, or something totally different like perplexity.
When retrieving a web page _for the user_ it’s appropriate to use a UA string that looks like a browser client.
If perplexity is collecting training data in bulk without using their UA that’s a different thing, and they should stop. But this article doesn’t show that.</span>

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Stone at a public NASA event many years ago.  I asked him, perhaps a silly question: &quot;what does it feel like to know you built the furthest man-made known object in the universe?&quot;.
He paused for a moment, after which he responded, with a smile: &quot;Pretty darn good&quot;.
RIP, Dr. Stone and go Voyager go!

There are many excellent blogging platforms available nowadays. The concept of &quot;better&quot; is not especially relevant. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences and requirements.
This post outlines why I chose Bear after trying many different tools. If your blogging preferences align with mine, then Bear might be the right platform for you too. If you&#x27;re already happy with your current tool, congratulations – no need to keep reading.
Simplicity
At the last minute, I decided to leave this part out. Not that Bear isn&#x27;t easy to use, it&#x27;s very straightforward, but so are most other &quot;indie platforms&quot;. You&#x27;ll be up and running in no time, no matter what you pick.

 War is the health of the State. It automatically sets in motion throughout society those irresistible forces for uniformity, for passionate cooperation with the Government in coercing into obedience the minority groups and individuals which lack the larger herd sense. The machinery of government sets and enforces the drastic penalties. The minorities are either intimidated into silence, or brought slowly around by subtle process of persuasion which may seem to them really to be converting them. Of course, the ideal of perfect loyalty, perfect uniformity is never really attained. […] (I)n …</span>

 What makes you think you can govern me? 
 When my mind is about to explode and fling 
 Shrapnel in every direction and into the void 
 For this soul of mine is weeping, while yours gently 
 Blow sleeping in the gaze of protective eyes. 
 Barrage the barricades of your world ‘til they tumble 
 Crumble onto the doorstep of our anarchist utopia? 
 A ticking fission or fusion bomb around the nuclear family - 
 I cannot wait until it disintegrates into ash 
 It never did anything to me - Blood 
 Lines only weave together pain - Choose 
 Your own kind over the abstract confines 
 Of a triple helix with the extra back 
 Bone of suffering. 
 The bigotry ebbs and flows through our collective 
 Memories that we perhaps should forget but cannot 
 Unsee through flashbacks of those who harmed - 
 Us, through bricks at glass and break the institution 
 That hates us - that seeks to eradicate us 
 Yas I may be extreme but was that ever a bad thing - 
 I’ll just shine with the light of a trillion photons 
 Exploding and releasing the energy 
 Of my ungovernable queer self.</span>

 Dear Society, 
 Telling me the way to go - never fit myself into your gender 
 Confines and even in my disruption their compulsion to fit 
 Me into a box flickers behind… shadows. The flames 
 Burning my mind, or am I burning. Fuck. Their stereotypes. 
 You cannot speak up about anything. Be passionate. 
 Rant about ableism and transphobia and they give strange looks 
 And yeah girls can do that, but I’m not one of them… 
 And my identity of being loud… is this just internalized misogyny…? 
 Head and a broken body, too wrong, but I feel no connection to the physical 
 Right…? 
 I guess that’s a lie. Cannot be stoic. Only a fragment.

                              <span>As debt pressures rise, South Asia&#x27;s economic strategies are increasingly revolving around FTAs. The frenzy, however, is not only reshaping the region&#x27;s trade dynamics, but also a wide array of national legal frameworks, from labour rights to agriculture policies.

We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since March 2024. As usual, we wish to remind our readers that the DSGE model forecast is not an official New York Fed forecast, but only an input to the Research staff’s overall forecasting process. For more information about the model and variables discussed here, see our DSGE model Q &amp; A.</span>

I&#x27;ve published a few essays about how journaling has impacted my life by providing the space for me to reflect on my day. One thing I have never done until this year, however, is read any of my old journals.
This may seem strange, since what is the point of writing if not to be read. But that isn&#x27;t why I do it. I write as a practice. As a thing that I do. If all my journals were lost in a house fire, I&#x27;d be sad, yes. But the documentation of my life isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s valuable. That value has already been gleaned through the act itself.
