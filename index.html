                              <span>sunday morning, june 9th, 2024
i woke up and cried.
i had a dream of my grandfather for the first time in a long, long time.
he died in 2011 after a painful battle with pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. by the end of it all, he told my mom he was tired and that he wanted to rest.
in my dream, i was seated at the breakfast nook, looking through my laptop. i had a messaging app open and i was texting my grandfather. he was dead in the dream and i was talking to him in the afterlife.
i told him about how i was birdwatching now—how his little granddaughter who hated the sun and the soil now goes to forests and rivers and hikes mountains, despite her fear of bugs.
i sent him an aerial view of a plane ride. my college graduation. my friends, who i’ve all met after his passing. i told him my cousins were in college now. i said i missed him over and over again.
i can’t remember his responses. all i remember was him saying he missed me too.
it was the first time i wasn’t a child in my dream. i was myself, all 23 and some of me.
it was the first time he was dead in my dream—that he wasn’t wearing his trademark red polo and tan slacks.
there’s something bittersweet about that. i think i prefer the dreams where he’s still alive and i am still a child, clinging to the hem of his pants and telling him where to find the parking lot in my favourite mall (he knows the way so much better than i do, but he still follows my lead).
it’s been 13 years since his death. i’ve moved on, mostly. but there is a hole in my heart in the shape of our secret dates to fast food restaurants; a hole in the shape of a grandfather who adored me enough to take a drive over an hour across the city just because i missed him. it’s a hole only a grandfather can fill.
it will stay empty for the rest of my life.

 Comrades!
Today I’m in high spirits (you know our life is not a straight line, nor constant, or static…), and those who know me personally know that I have a pretty black a sense of humour (what ‘scandalizes’ others makes me smile, etc.) almost cynically (especially when it comes to talking about/describing facts to do with the ‘Law’, ‘Rights’, the ‘Authorities’, etc.); because these are ‘things’ that I can’t take seriously (even though my life is wrapped up in all tha…</span>

 ‘Anarchist prisoners are not alone’ and ‘if they touch one, they touch all’ are slogans that lived once again in the everyday anarchist action before, during and after the trial against us. The screams of disgust for authority that pierced the police control and the walls around those on trial clearly enraged the judge and magistrates, as was evident on their faces and which put smiles on ours. The presence in court of dear ones known and unknown filled us with pride and joy, preventing the prosecutors’ accusations and demands from having any possibility of intimidating us. T…</span>

(Italy, Mexico, Greece)
 On Wednesday, June 13th, the international anti-anarchist campaign under the name ‘operation boldness’ was set up. The Italian antiterrorism forces of ROS and carabiniers were put under the command of the Inquisitor-prosecutor of Perugia Manuela Comodi, and proceeded to arrest eight anarchist comrades. In parallel, investigations are conducted against other comrades as well (among them are the comrades of Edizioni Cerbero).

We are not usually “bothered” by the panic-ridden scenaria of the media, yet the importance of the event forces us to take a public position directly, without a connection to any attack of ours.

 This statement is made to clarify and publicly state our position in relation to our recent attempted escape from prison. 
 The fact that we are captives in the prison cells of democracy does not mean that we accept for a moment our position either as prisoners or as defendants before the civil court-martial that you have set up against us. There will never be either a prison guard to lock up our soul or a judge to rule on our values. We are eternal enemies of law and order and eternal prison breakers.

 It was the dawn of May 22, 2009, when an explosion in Santiago, Chile caused fragments which crossed endless kilometers and borders until they brought us the news that were nailed in our hearts. 
 It was the dawn of May 22, 2009 when our brother and comrade Mauricio Morales, consistent fighter of the anarchist insurrection, put his conspiratorial plan in place, heading to the school of prison guards in Santiago in order to blow it up.

I The choice of claiming responsibility and not capitulation
 We as Conspiracy of Cells of Fire-imprisoned members, chose and claimed responsibility from inside the prison for our participation in our project. The responsibility claim is the least way to defend and honour the most beautiful acts that we share. Not as a memory that fades away after our arrests but as a living reality and prospect of carrying on our actions in the continuous present, the here and now.

It is sometimes useful to keep a distance from events before you talk about them. Anticipation and the frozen time of captivity in prison accelerate, nevertheless, the cool-headed distance from events. A self-possessed distance gives you the opportunity to observe details which are usually ignored and bulldozed by the warm blood conditions’ momentum of intensity. So, as they often say, “the devil is hidden in the details”…

 It’s been already 25 days that the mother of Christos and Gerasimos Tsakalos and the girlfriend of the second one are locked up in the cells of democracy. 
 We have already been for 25 days on hunger strike until death, demanding their immediate release. 
 It’s been 25 days and already eight of us are in hospitals with their health condition on the limits. 
 25 days are not just a number on a calendar, it is the experiment of evolution of repression, with new methods of emotional blackmail against imprisoned anarchist urban guerrillas.

 In the incidents of the 5th May concerning the fire in the Marfin Bank there were three dead bank employees and thousands of “charred” truths. The suffocating atmosphere of the heartbreaking hypocrisy of propaganda and the worn moralistic humanism of the radical movement’s Cassandras, force us to take a public stand concerning these events. This does not mean that we are talking as “specialists” of violence, or that we are “self-appointed” prosecutors or defenders of the people who attacked the bank building. But we find it necessary that some things …</span>

 A huge storm of revolt raged through the streets of Greece in December 2008. After the young Andreas Grigoropoulos was murdered by a cop, riots spread throughout the whole country for several weeks. Hundreds of banks, shops, car dealers, offices,… were attacked, plundered and put on fire. Although it were anarchists and anti-authoritarians who took the lead in this storm during the first week after the murder, it spread itself fast and many people got involved in this revolt against miserable living conditions, against the…</span>

 Many things have been written and said about solidarity. Usually when there have been so many discussions and so many texts have circulated on a matter, it ends up trite, predictable and without any particular interest. It seems as if its content has run out and it’s constantly being repeated.

That last remark has been echoing in my head. It runs directly contrary to the advice I received from my parents and their friends growing up. Hearing my aunts now telling me to follow my dreams and not to worry about money makes me wonder how my mom&#x27;s framed this new career shift of mine.
A large part of me is suspicious. Mom always told me growing up that being an adult was learning to do things you didn&#x27;t want to do and that nobody would pay me to do a job I found fun. Why&#x27;s she switching it up on me now? Did it take me crashing and burning in an actual job for her to realize I&#x27;m not cut out for a life in STEM? I try not to look back with regret, but how much further along would I be had I chased something I liked earlier?
In Zen in the Art of Writing Bradbury reflects and decides that &quot;looking back over a lifetime, you see that love was the answer to everything.&quot; I&#x27;ve been thinking about that as I prepare mentally for a week (and month) of writing and teaching writing for fifty hours a week, things my parents have been telling everyone are things I like to do. At the risk of speaking too soon (knocks on wood), this is the first Sunday I&#x27;m not actually dreading the coming week, if not ever then at least for a very long time. I&#x27;m nervous and well aware that my schedule will test me, but a strong undercurrent of appreciation for what I&#x27;m doing (and not doing) buoys me now and that is nothing short of a revelation for me.</span>

I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.

I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…</span>

You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet. That should be a commonplace idea. And that inevitably means facing up to the necessity of putting an end to capitalism in favor of an economic system of rationality, sustainability and equity for all the world’s peoples.
It can’t be said too many times that the concept of “green capitalism” is a chimera. Unfortunately, belief in that chimera is not limited to the world’s center-left political parties; it extends to the world’s Green parties. Various “Green New Deal” programs have been floated in recent years, generally revolving around a massive buildout of renewable-energy infrastructure and strengthening the social safety net. On their own, there is no rational argument that such programs, should they materialize, would not provide some benefits. But how transformative are such programs?

Since 1897, Zionism has been the religious and political impetus behind what is now the nation-state of Israel, which, like the United States, is settled on the lives, land, and cultures of millions of Indigenous peoples. Although today’s Israel began as a refuge for European Jews fleeing the Holocaust, Zionism long ago broke out of its moral constraints to become a formidable geopolitical force that demands study. Which is why, in late 2023 America, the Institute for the Critical Study of Zionism was created. And why, because the Institute is fundamentally antizionist, it’s under attack for antisemitism.

                              <span>Weekends are an interesting concept for me. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I’m already counting down to Friday afternoon, which marks the start of of my weekend. I spend the whole week wishing for the weekend, but why exactly?
Weekdays are exhausting. I’ve mentioned that I&#x27;m not a morning person, despite having to be bright, fresh and ready for stand-up at 7am. After work, I crash and crawl into bed for my (much needed) afternoon nap. When I wake up, I am FAMISHED, so we either prep dinner or pick something up. After dinner, I decompress (reading or tv) or work out. Then the next day, it starts all over again. All of the errands, housekeeping, and life things that need to get done take a backseat during the weekdays because... work really just takes up a majority of my brain power.
By the time the weekend rolls around, personal and household to-do lists are endless. We spend the entire weekend being productive in other areas of our life that we neglected during the week. Because of this, there are times when there&#x27;s just little room for excursions or “fun”. There are things that need to get done, so we get them done during the weekend.
It&#x27;s an odd thing to look forward to doing other work outside of actual work. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the work that I look forward to, but the shift in productivity. Although it’s nice to be productive, sometimes I wish we had more time for the fun things we actually want to do. Weekends are another kind of busy, but they could be so much more than just catching up on life’s to-dos.
Where is that petition for the 4-day work week?
This weekend’s task: Prep for the over-the-range microwave delivery, by attempting to figure out how to remove the backsplash.

                              <span>What&#x27;s up?
You made it through the day. I&#x27;m proud of you. Seriously, I&#x27;m so proud of you.
If nobody told you today, I love you. I mean that with all my heart.
You made it through today, and you should be proud of yourself too.
Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to look forward to anything when you&#x27;re feeling down. But when you reach the end of the day and look back at what you went through, you&#x27;ll see you have more to look forward to because every day it gets a bit better.
I always tell myself, &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll feel better. Someday I&#x27;ll be alright.&quot; Remember, that &quot;someday&quot; comes one day at a time, and you&#x27;ll get there. You will.
I&#x27;m proud of you. I&#x27;m very proud of you.
Make sure you come back.

                              <span>Blogging is back and today we have a myriad of great platforms to choose from. This one is hosted on Bear. If you have your own blog and are reading this, chances are that your blog is also a Bear one. 🐻
However, one of the things most of these “indie tools” lack is a search feature. I’ve written a separate post about it: The basic feature blogging platforms lack. 🔎
Well, it looks like things are about to change for us Bear bloggers. I just noticed that Herman&#x27;s blog now has such a feature (can’t recall having seen it before). And it works elegantly. 🤩
Let&#x27;s hope this is something we&#x27;ll all have soon. Thank you in advance, Herman! ✌️
Update: Bear user Yordi made it possible to add your own (example). You can get yours here. Thank you, Yordi! 😎
Update 2: The search results only include links to posts where the search word is included in the title. Hopefully there will come a “true search feature” in the future.</span>

                              <span>Whoops, they did it again. Only this time it was no “tragic mistake.” There were no apologies. Indeed, the IDF claimed the bombing was a “precision strike.” The target? An UNRWA school in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza, which was being used as a shelter for thousands of displaced Palestinian families. The victims: at least 40 killed, 14 of them children and 9 women. Another 75 were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women. The weapon? A US-made GBU 39, the same bombs used to kill 45 people at the Tel al-Sultan tent encampment outside Rafah last week.

                              <span>Friday nights in New York have an energy about them, one that&#x27;s been easier for me to pick up on after arriving in the city midweek. I&#x27;m not used to it, like a river fish dumped in a tank. Everyone&#x27;s dressed up in skin and mascara and waiting to go to the clubs and even though that life is not for me I love soaking in their anticipation on the subway platforms. Back when I worked abroad in that job I hated I remember writing something about how my soul left my body on Monday mornings and returned on Friday nights. I don&#x27;t miss that feeling one bit, but I do sometimes think about that hunger for life I felt on Friday evenings, that burning desire to avenge the week of my life I sold to live for two days. If I could bottle that joie de vivre and down it everyday, I&#x27;d be unstoppable.

                              <span>I was listening to an interview with the Swedish artist Peter Jöback. They were talking about aging and he said:
I feel like my life started after I turned 50. It&#x27;s so much fun getting older! Now I can face the world with ease.
He says that after 50 he feels he has become more playful and that life feels &quot;less serious&quot;.
I turned 50 myself a couple of years ago and I can relate 100 percent. Aside from a few minor “bugs”, like always having to keep a pair of reading glasses handy, there are only positive changes.
I don&#x27;t worry so much about what people think of me. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care about things - on the contrary, humility and compassion are more prominent than ever - but I&#x27;ve come to truly realize that you can never control what others think and say about you.
You can&#x27;t please them all – and that&#x27;s fine!
In many ways, I think aging is a bit like the story of Benjamin Button. Not in terms of appearance, of course. Aging is noticeable in the form of gray hairs here and there, and other hairs have completely given up, never to return, etc…
But that doesn’t feel very important.
The lightness, though, really does feel like it makes the mind younger and younger. Like magic! It&#x27;s more fun and interesting to live.
No matter your age, stay curious and enjoy life. Aging is pretty awesome, trust me.

                              <span>Since the launch of ChatGPT back in 2022 AI has explod — just kidding. Those lead-ins are getting tiring, right?
But what has become even more irritating is how everything is &quot;AI-powered&quot; all of a sudden.
Let me make it clear up-front that I am not opposed to using AI, whatever that means anymore, for a product. I&#x27;ve done it myself and it&#x27;s a good way to add value to the product, if it really needs it.
But what truly irks me are the common-day apps which have been just fine without such AI plug-ins and, all of a sudden, they become &quot;AI-powered&quot;. Here are a few things that go through my head when &quot;AI-powered&quot; is advertised up-front:
How reliable are the outputs / are hallucinations present?
Where does my data go? (Probably OpenAI, but not 100% sure)
Is the AI-powered going to be a mark-up?

Rasha was simply going about her day. She owned a beauty salon in Majd Al-Krum, a town in the Galilee. She was running routine errands when Israeli police pulled her over. Rasha is tall and elegant. She has the face of a model and long, shimmering black hair. She was wearing a sleek black dress. She tried to maintain her composure as Israeli police swarmed around her. There is a look of confusion and then a flash of fear on her face as she is told she’s being arrested.  More

                              <span>The neoliberal attack on government expenditure in poorer countries was a key driver of international migration. Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy. More

But I am pointing out that while New York State court has jurisdiction over convicted felon Trump, the judge has both the right and the obligation—before issuing a sentence—to find out if the defendant has understood the charges that were brought against him. (From his endless press conferences during his trials, Trump sounds clueless about the facts in his own cases.) More

                              <span>The whole phony case against Assange stinks of corruption and abuse of power. Corruption because the CIA under Mike “Get Assange” Pompeo plotted to kidnap or murder the journalist and also, corruptly, listened in on his privileged conversations with his attorney in the Ecuadoran embassy. Corruption because bogus charges were cooked up against him by a pliant Swedish prosecutor, the sole purpose of which was to toss Assange into the clutches of the furious U.S. government. Assange did not rape those two women in Sweden, and the prosecutor eventually dropped the case. But the damage was done: to Assange’s reputation and to his freedom, because once he sought refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy, he was trapped. More

                              <span>Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They&#x27;re all pretty great!

And as we witness the televised genocide of the Palestinian people, it appears that the international system of liberal governance seems to be collapsing like a house of cards.

first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash
and markdown kicked off the project we have today. Who could have predicted that 10 years later,
Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn&#x27;t just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the
7M+ Developers,

                              <span>The point of this blog was to put myself out there. Why? I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don&#x27;t get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!</span>

However, it is only from 2022 onwards that large models (LLM, LAM, and others) are gaining traction and attention worldwide. It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana&#x27;s AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane&#x27;s brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and &quot;pay-to-win&quot; games (which use NFTs).

                              <span>Vegetating aside, the last few days before big moves usually also brings lots of appointments. This week I get my teeth cleaned and eyes checked before I leave, scheduling follow-ups in a year and making plans to be back for them.
Going to these appointments is one of the few activities I actually prefer my parents come along. Not because I enjoy their company (it&#x27;s hit or miss), but because I&#x27;m no good at doing the things they usually do. (And by &#x27;they&#x27; I mean my mom.)
Today before I leave for the optometrist Mom tells me I shouldn&#x27;t agree to pay more than $110 for my visit, the same amount we paid last year. Upon arrival, the receptionist informs me that the fee for checkups is $250 now. $250? I thought it was supposed to be $110, I say. She shows me a packet with the price printed in bo…</span>

                              <span>Everything is dependent on feedback loops. Video games/reels have short exciting feedback loops. That is why they are so addictive. Real life often has long feedback loops. Anything you do, it will take time to see the results.
You will have to grind hard at something and for a sufficiently long amount of time to achieve something meaningful. Yet if your brain is trained to enjoy short feedback loops it becomes hard to do something for long without seeing exciting results.
You either train yourself to enjoy long feedback loops or you shorten the loop through regular rewards. Maybe break down the huge task into small chunks.
It is often good to run both a long and short feedback loop on a task. The long loop keeps you aware of the bigger picture so the setbacks don&#x27;t seem as bad. The short loop keeps you on track and gives that constant nudge in the right direction.
You are already in a feedback loop whether you are aware of it or not. Better off being in a feedback loop that helps you grow. One of your own making.</span>
