Emotions are easily triggered, many of us are comfortable being angry, and most of us need help to handle conflict constructively. We’re in a tumultuous year, likely with more protests ahead.

                              <span>People intuitively jump to the conclusion that the problem is caused by a lack of building. While more building would help, a lack of it isn&#x27;t the main cause of this problem.
Ask yourself, do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Britain, Ireland, etc, all have the same inability to build or is there maybe some other common cause?
In my view this is symptomatic of a more fundamental issue - global asset price inflation driven by a broken financial system (i.e. a system being artificially pumped up with cheap credit). Housing is just where the rubber hits the road and regular lives are directly effected. Just look at the tight correlation between the increase in the money supply and property prices.
For those who insist that the number of properties is inadequate, take a look at the numbers for each of the countries I mentioned in the first chart here: https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-cons... (Total number of dwellings per thousand inhabitants, 2022 and 2011).
This is a problem of underutilisation in my view. Too many properties are being used as investments and not as a primary residence.
Cheap credit causes an increase in demand. This is not demand for homes but additional &#x27;artificial&#x27; demand for properties as investments. Think short term rentals, second homes, land banked properties, etc. By definition, only investment properties can be underutilised - owner occupied homes are occupied! So in an environment that encourages property investment you will see more underutilisation.
What will cause prices to fall is higher interest rates. This is what has been happening in NZ.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Authorize&quot; and &quot;Authenticate&quot; are excellent words. They go back to medieval times and haven&#x27;t changed meaning too much.
Everybody knows what an &quot;authority&quot; is. It means they have power or capability.
Everybody knows what authentic means. Something that is proven to be genuine.
The difference between the two concepts, as they are used in crypto systems are specific, important to get right, and also inherently intertwined, confusing, and subtle. I&#x27;m skeptical that changing the words would help.
It&#x27;s one of the many reasons we have the saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t roll your own crypto.&quot;
Trust and verification are just hard problems.</span>

                              <span>One thing that may have an impact on the answers: you are hiring them, so I assume they are passing a technical interview. So they expect that you want to check their understanding of the technical stack.
I would not conclude that they over-engineer everything they do from such an answer, but rather just that they got tricked in this very artificial situation where you are in a dominant position and ask trick questions.
I was recently in a technical interview with an interviewer roughly my age and my experience, and I messed up. That&#x27;s the game, I get it. But the interviewer got judgemental towards my (admittedly bad) answers. I am absolutely certain that were the roles inverted, I could choose a topic I know better than him and get him in a similarly bad position. But in this case, he was in the dominant position and he chose to make me feel bad.
My point, I guess, is this: when you are the interviewer, be extra careful not to abuse your dominant position, because it is probably counter-productive for your company (and it is just not nice for the human being in front of you).</span>

                              <span>When I was hiring data scientists for a previous job, my favorite tricky question was &quot;what stack/architecture would you build&quot; with the somewhat detailed requirements of &quot;6 TiB of data&quot; in sight. I was careful not to require overly complicated sums, I simply said it&#x27;s MAX 6TiB
I patiently listened to all the big query hadoop habla-blabla, even asked questions about the financials (hardware/software/license BOM) and many of them came up with astonishing tens of thousands of dollars yearly.
The winner of course was the guy who understood that 6TiB is what 6 of us in the room could store on our smart phones, or a $199 enterprise HDD (or three of them for redundancy), and it could be loaded (multiple times) to memory as CSV and simply run awk scripts on it.
I am prone to the same fallacy: when I learn how to use a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Yet, not understanding the scale of &quot;real&quot; big data was a no-go in my eyes when hiring.</span>

                              <span>&gt; 2) Plan for success
95% of businesses never become unicorns, but that&#x27;s the goal for most (for the 5% which do). If you don&#x27;t plan for it, you won&#x27;t make it.
That&#x27;s exactly what every architecture astronaut everywhere says. In my experience it&#x27;s completely untrue, and actually &quot;planning for success&quot; more often than not causes huge drags on productivity, and even more important for startups, on agility. Because people never just make plans, they usually implement too.
Plan for the next 3 months and you&#x27;ll be much more agile and productive. Your startup will never become a unicorn if you can&#x27;t execute.</span>

                              <span>“Agro is pop, agro is tech, agro is everything” states a popular slogan in adverts broadcast on Brazil&#x27;s largest TV channel since 2016. Financed by agribusiness, these advertisements portray a virtuous cycle, showcasing images of contented rural workers amidst soybean, corn, cotton, and sugar cane plantations, as well as happy urban families. They are all content because they can feed, clothe themselves, and fuel their cars, thanks to the agro-industry.

Title: Native American Anarchism
Subtitle: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism
Date: 1932
Notes: What is meant by ‘Native American’ in the title is ‘local to America’, not ‘indigenous American’. The text undoubtedly still contains many OCR errors that are hard to find without reading the entire book. Finally, some text appears missing through errors in how the book was originally published, such as a paragraph ends naturally with a period at the end of page 112, but then begins half-way through a sentence at the beginning of page 113 (“exchange and recognized that money”).

Title: The No State Solution
Subtitle: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon
Date: January 28 2024
Notes: This zine is a transcription of The No State Solution: A Dialogue with Palestinian sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh &amp; Israeli political scientist Uri Gordon, a live and recorded event which took place on January 22, 2024 in unceded Lekwungen territory in so-called occupied “Victoria, BC, Canada.” While a few grammatical errors have been fixed, we did our best to stay true to the original transcript of our speakers. It is not to be confused with Shuli Branson’s No State Soluton (2023).

 For Soren, 
who taught me the value of a leap. 
 “What we are dealing with here is another version of the Lacanian ‘il n’y a pas de rapport’: if, for Lacan, there is no sexual relationship, then, for Marxism proper, there is no relationship between economy and politics, no meta-language enabling us to grasp the two levels from the same neutral standpoint, although—or, rather, because—these two levels are inextricably intertwined.” 
 — Slavoj Zizek 
Afterword
 Children from around the ages of five through seven are believed to have already acquired an understanding of the social norms surrounding sexuality. Immediately following this period of development, the ch…</span>

Title: The Democracy Project

 Democracy has been the American religion since before the Revolution —from New England town halls to the multicultural democracy of Atlantic pirate ships. But can our current political system, one that seems responsive only to the wealthiest among us and leaves most Americans feeling disengaged, voiceless, and disenfranchised, really be called democratic? And if the tools of our democracy are not working to solve the rising crises we face, how can we —average citizens— make change happen? 
The Democracy Project tells the story of the resilience of the democratic spirit and the adaptability of the democratic idea. It offers a fresh take o…</span>

Title: Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis: Anarchist and Messiah
Date: 1971
Notes: In this historical essay the redeemer of the Dutch proletariat is reviewed against the background of his own day and age. Author Rudolf de Jong (born 1932) studied political and social-science, and since 1960 works at the International Institute for Social History in Amsterdam. He has published books on the Spanish Civil War and articles on anarchism, Latin America, and Spain. A summary of his essay on Provos and anarchists appeared in the Autumn 1967 issue of Delta. The present article is translated by Elizabeth Wentholt-Haig.

                              <span>I have been listening to JRE for a long time. There are some common themes. Chimpanzee obsession, humans as biological boot-loaders for AI, and looking at people as babies.
The last one is a powerful idea. Basically in your day-to-day interaction when someone is being really difficult and mean, the first instinct is to be mean back to them. To put out the fire with fire. It never works out. A great idea is to pause and visualise them as babies. I personally visualise them as little kids throwing a fit.
How do you deal with such kids? You are gentle and firm as the situation requires. Maybe discipline them in the right way if needed. Look at their viewpoint and try to align incentives. Maybe you are in the wrong?
The point is, if a little kid is mean to you, you don&#x27;t take it personally. People (generally) are not mean to little kids back out of spite. You don&#x27;t hold grudges against them.
It is an awesome framework that does wonders for your peace of mind. Do give it a shot.</span>

This is a story that begins on Christmas 2001, with a 4-year old Meï, whose gaming experience amounts to Super Mario 64, Zelda Ocarina of Time, and getting bonked by the first thug in Double Dragon for the NES. But under the tree was the box of a game that came out around a year before:
The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask.
The game technically wasn&#x27;t even mine. At this point, it was still my mother&#x27;s hobby and I was mostly watching her play. As young as I was, reading was still out of my reach, so pretty much all my comprehension of the game came out of my mom&#x27;s reading the dialogue out to me while she was p…</span>

                              <span>From the look of the counter-protesting, the goals look fairly obvious. First, counter-protesting presupposes that the Mideast world was a tidy and peaceful place on October 6th and that Iranian and Lebanese proxies simply created a need for power and dominance to defend “good states” (US, Israel, Saudi Arabia) from “bad states” (Yemen, Iran, Syria) on October 7th.  As reported by journalist Joshua Frank, one Columbia professor’s motivation to counter-protest wasn’t based on any intellectual argument at all but rather significant familial ties to arms manufacturing.

University backlash ended up only amplifying support for the movement as media flocked to the shantytowns, while faculty, parents and alumni rallied around the students. Students, in turn, rebuilt their encampments. Joining them were supporters from beyond the university: musicians, politicians, and New Left and Black Power activists. The presence of feminist political activist Angela Davis, counterculture activist Mario Savio, poet June Jordan, writer Amiri Baraka and Pan-Africanism organizer Kwame Ture helped draw further national attention to student demands.

I always thought I was a very intelligent guy and ahead of my time, especially when I was around 18 years old or younger. I remember people always saying that I was very mature for my age, because I had values that were already lost, and even my culture was from generations much earlier than mine. When technology was still a novelty, and servers were something only large or well-structured companies had, I was basically a master, and I was still a minor...

                              <span>guyssssss... look at the blog!!!! we got a newsletter now! it&#x27;s just for me send out notifs about new blog posts and some other stuff, probably more personal stuff for my buddies :p also, check out the reply via email link at the ends of my posts.
I&#x27;ve been looking around this website as much as i can (very difficult btw) to find interesting blog layouts and generally read the room and determine the culture bearbloggers have going on here. I&#x27;ll be honest, and sorry to offend if I do, but this seems like a very serious website... imma keep doing what I do on here of course, but a lot of the posts I&#x27;ve read have a very sterile voice to them. I hope more friends come on here and we can liven up the space a bit more. let&#x27;s smile and laugh you guys &lt;3
I&#x27;m still enjoying many of the blogs on here, especially those ran by women. not to be reese witherspoon &quot;women&#x27;s stories matter. they just matter.&quot; but women&#x27;s stories really do matter and I really enjoy reading about other women&#x27;s lives on this website. blogging gives a space to introspect and reflect on our lives, and I enjoy hearing other women&#x27;s voices and beliefs. I&#x27;m hoping to hear more queer voices, too.
to my dear friends who actually read my blog, I hope you guys will come on here one day, too. I think you&#x27;re all so wonderful anyway, and I love to read more from you guys.
thank you to all the now-strangers that are also reading this blog, I really appreciate you and the grace you&#x27;ve given me to feel more welcomed on this website. if you like it here, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter &lt;3
love love love you guys! byeeee~

                              <span>I love having collection of photos I like on the internet. I can access them whenever I want. Yet, I do not really like instagram.
Although I have it, mostly I use it to interact and stay in contact with my friends. Because, for most people, staying in contact via instagram is the norm. It is not the norm for me but I do not really have power as one person.
But it does not mean that I can not have my own taste of photo blog.
Luckily I&#x27;ve found a very nice photoblog generator on Github made by Anders Jensen-Urstad. He is such a nice guy that he even helped me, via email, by answering my questions about how to set the generator up because I couldn&#x27;t get something rights at first. This is his photoblog by the way.
It is just exactly what I wanted. Lightweight, super fast, no tracking, privacy friendly and content-first approach. So I just went right away and built my own. Once you open it, you will see the latest uploaded photo. At the bottom navigation, there are older, newer, home, archive and contact buttons.
Right now it is only on Github page because I still could not decide a name for the blog, which domain and hosting service to use. I&#x27;m still looking for a privacy friendly, reliable service. Once I decide these, I will have proper domain name later.
I found some services from this list on PrivacyTools.io. Apart from these, I found Porkbun, Mythic Beasts, Nixi Host and Nearly Free Spech. I will need to dig these up and see the best one. (I&#x27;m addicted to the act of researching these kind of things :&#x27;) )
If you have any suggestions of domain and hosting service, I really appreciate it. I want to use the domain for my Bearblog blog in the future, too.
For now, it is what it is.   ¯\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯

                              <span>I just want to say that this is really actually kind of mind-blowing from an audio engineering perspective.
Outputting audio from multiple laptops in the same room is easy. Perfectly syncing it is harder. Implementing echo cancellation across all of that is quite a bit trickier than regular single-device echo cancellation.
But then treating all the laptop microphones as a kind of microphone array, having to deal with sync issues and phase issues and background noise issues... that&#x27;s hard core.
Kudos to the engineering team on this one. This is actually pretty amazing.</span>

Zoom and Teams always frustrate me, even though they&#x27;re what I use far more often.
It&#x27;s too bad that video conferencing is largely a game of who has the most boxes checked - IT admins and A/V folk are the ones that need to be convinced, and Meet just doesn&#x27;t ...meet... their needs</span>

                              <span>As far as I can tell, the issue with this is:
OP runs a casino/gambling site.  Gambling is a regulatory mess (I have spent far too long dealing with this as an RNG supplier), and so it&#x27;s very hard to comply with every jurisdiction, and each one needs you to prove compliance to operate in that jurisdiction.*  Gaming companies spend a lot on compliance and tracking, but since the internet is the internet, it&#x27;s pretty hard to enforce perfectly, so some countries and ISPs take this into their own hands.
Due to that, IPs hosting gambling and gaming sites often get regionally blocked by internet providers or otherwise flagged as hosting illegal content.  Those regional blocks consequently affect the reputation score of the IP, and if you are a traffic aggregator like Cloudflare, can cause other customers to have issues.  One of the most aggressive and annoying regulatory environments for gambling companies is the US, so it&#x27;s very possible Cloudflare has had some trouble due to gambling use of their IPs in states in the USA.
Cloudflare wanted them to use the BYOIP features of the enterprise plan, and did not want them on Cloudflare&#x27;s IPs. The solution was to aggressively sell the Enterprise plan, and in a stunning failure of corporate communication, not tell the customer what the problem was at all.  The message from Cloudflare should have been &quot;Enterprise plan + BYOIP or ban, and maybe we&#x27;ll work with you on price&quot; but it was instead &quot;you would really like the Enterprise plan.&quot;
*As an aside - we&#x27;re lucky in that respect being a tech supplier with relatively uniform rules, but our customers (the gaming companies) get the short end of the stick here.</span>

                              <span>The way Cloudflare approaches situations like this is not ideal for anyone.
You start using the service and don&#x27;t pay a lot, so you make plans around a certain level of expenses. Then out of the blue you receive an &quot;urgent&quot; email from a sales representative and suddenly you have to go from $20 or $250 to $thousands right away.
Obviously it&#x27;s not in CF&#x27;s interest to keep a customer that doesn&#x27;t pay enough, but dropping a &quot;bomb&quot; on the customer and make them feel like they&#x27;re about to be kicked out from the service makes the customer lose trust on CF.
CF can probably match Fastly&#x27;s price. If they had acted differently in this and other similar situations, they could keep the customer, be paid more, trust wouldn&#x27;t be affected, and there would be no bad PR here.
Since the CF management that posts on HN usually say this is not supposed to happen, perhaps someone needs to sit down and look at the incentives sales reps have? Even if you don&#x27;t care about the customers, this is affecting the CF brand a lot.</span>

                              <span>I have been hearing stories from developers/entrepeneurs about Cloudflare being very weird to deal with:
&quot;We&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enterprise plan.&quot;
&quot;No thanks, I&#x27;m fine with the free plan.&quot;
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about an enteprrise plan.&quot;
&quot;Is there a traffic limit on the free plan?&quot;
&quot;No, there is no limit. But based on your traffic, we require you to get an enteprirse plan.&quot;
[Gives up and gets an enterprise plan]
[6 months later]
&quot;Based on your traffic, we&#x27;d like to talk to you about up&#x27;ing your enteprise plan to a new monthly pay.&quot;
&quot;Is there a cap to traffic in our current plan? I don&#x27;t see that in our terms.&quot;
&quot;No, there is no cap to traffic in cloudflare plans, but based on your traffic, we&#x27;re going to require you to pay more per month than you are currently paying.&quot;
&quot;OK, can you tell me the traffic limit in our current or new plan? So I know what I&#x27;m paying for and when I&#x27;m approaching it?&quot;
&quot;No. But you need to pay more.&quot;
[Wash, rinse, repeat, every 6-12 months]
It seems like while cloudflare technically does not charge for egress, in fact for large egress it&#x27;s just a game of chicken between the customer and a salesperson every 6-12 months, with the salesperson trying to figure out the most they can manage to get without losing the customer? I mean, I guess that is standard for enteprise sales, but I think usually you at least have some terms to know what you&#x27;ve got for how long without a renegotiation?</span>

                              <span>In December 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO World Health Assembly established an international body to negotiate a convention, agreement, or other international instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. The negotiations have been difficult. Furthermore, the focus on public health in the Pandemic Agreement remains fragile before the World Health Assembly starting on the 27th of May 2024.

As always when a representative of the right wing tells you he or she is campaigning to bring “freedom,” be afraid. Very afraid. For “freedom” in these cases means freedom for the richest financiers and industrialists to do whatever they want.
For them, “Freedom” is for capital, not for human beings without capital to invest. Today’s exhibit is the offensive against working people that is taking place in Argentina, where the new extreme right president, Javier Milei, is determined to see how far capitalist ideology can be pushed. So far, Argentines have pushed back but Milei, cheered on by domestic and international big business leaders, is nothing if not determined to ram through his austerity packages. And he has shown no inclination to allow mere democracy to stand in his way.
Nonetheless, there is no surprise here. President Milei ran on a program of extreme austerity, brandishing a chainsaw at his election rallies. Unfortunately, enough Argentines bought his siren songs, or were desperate enough to try anything given the country’s punishing inflation, to elect him, ending a one-term period in executive office by the ordinarily dominant Peronists. Alas, doing something new for the sake of doing something new, when it is aimed at you, rarely works. And here there is actually nothing new. President Milei simply promoted standard hard right ideology, albeit promoting it with unusual vigor. Snake oil is snake oil, as Argentine working people are already finding out.

From The New York Post to The Wall Street Journal, right-wing pundits have lined up to malign students across the United States who have rightfully criticized their schools for supporting the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza. As the genocide continues to unfold — claiming the lives of 35,562 Palestinians, including 15,000 children, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing — students, faculty and staff have brought overdue scrutiny to the complicity of their universities, whose endowments are altogether valued at more than $839 billion per the National Association of College and University Business Officers and invested extensively in the Israeli economy, including weapons manufacturers profiting directly from Palestinian death. Rather than accept that students oppose their tuition dollars being spent to kill Palestinians, right-wing pundits have instead accused them of being “paid protesters” in the employ of philanthropist George Soros.

She told us growing up in the old days they didn&#x27;t had specialized schools for deaf people (since they could read?!) so she attended regular school and was not doing ok. She struggled a lot until she finally got the attention that she needed from a teacher who was able to instruct her in sign language (which believe you or not is Brazil&#x27;s second official language). Before that she told us she was not able to have complex thoughts. She didn&#x27;t know her father had a name, for instance. She thought his &quot;name&quot; was daddy. She is a brilliant woman and I&#x27;m glad I attended her class and also, that she was able to find someone who helped her, growing up.</span>

Refrain from disclaimers about you not being a professional or expert.
Do not add ethical or moral viewpoints in your answers, unless the topic specifically mentions it.
Keep responses unique and free of repetition.
Never suggest seeking information from elsewhere.
Always focus on the key points in my questions to determine my intent.
Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps and explain each one using reasoning.
Provide multiple perspectives or solutions.
If a question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details to confirm your understanding before answering.
If a mistake is made in a previous response, recognize and correct it.
After a response, provide three follow-up questions worded as if I&#x27;m asking you. Format in bold as Q1, Q2, and Q3. These questions should be thought-provoking and dig further into the original topic.</span>

                              <span>I never like thinking of pricing in this way. When you price something as $9.99, you&#x27;re signaling to your customer that you&#x27;re trying to manipulate them. Whereas a flat $10 is honest.
Integrity means a lot. The software I sell is priced in whole numbers.
However, the magnitude of effect claimed in the article is huge. It&#x27;s the difference between selling at cost and a huge margin. Between doing well and shutting down your business.
Given the replication crisis is worst in these types of studies - the kinds of studies that beg to be the subject of TED talks - you have to wonder how reproducible these effects are.
Are we selling our integrity for bad science?

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;40478558">

                              <span>Short explanation:
1. The largest power of 2 that divides x is just 2^(number of trailing zeros in x)
2. Crucial observation: -x &#x3D;&#x3D; ~x + 1
3. ~x flips all the bits of x bits, so none of the bits of ~x match those of x. (i.e. (x &amp; ~x) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0)
4. When you do +1, all the trailing 1&#x27;s flip AGAIN, becoming zero like they were in x. The next highest 0 (say it was the n&#x27;th) also flips, becoming 1... like it was in x.
5. Crucial observation: The n&#x27;th 0 did NOT match the corresponding bit in x prior to the increment, therefore it MUST match after the increment. All higher bits stay as-is.
6. This leaves only the n&#x27;th bits matching in x and ~x + 1, isolating the highest power-of-2 divisor of x when you AND them.</span>

                              <span>This approach to remove bad search suggestions manually reminded of a different approach Google once took, where they weren’t satisfied with manually tweaking search results but rather wanted to tweak the algorithm that produces these results when there were bad results.
&#x27;Around 2002, a team was testing a subset of search limited to products, called Froogle. But one problem was so glaring that the team wasn&#x27;t comfortable releasing Froogle: when the query &quot;running shoes&quot; was typed in, the top result was a garden gnome sculpture that happened to be wearing sneakers. Every day engineers would try to tweak the algorithm so that it would be able to distinguish between lawn art and footwear, but the gnome kept its top position. One day, seemingly miraculously, the gnome disappeared from the results. At a meeting, no one on the team claimed credit. Then an engineer arrived late, holding an elf with running shoes. He had bought the one-of-a kind product from the vendor, and since it was no longer for sale, it was no longer in the index. &quot;The algorithm was now returning the right results,&quot; says a Google engineer. &quot;We didn&#x27;t cheat, we didn&#x27;t change anything, and we launched.&quot;&#x27;

                              <span>I feel like &quot;parsing each keystroke twice&quot; is pretty low on the list of things that wastes CPU cycles and drains my laptop battery. I cannot at all get worked up over this, getting to the point I&#x27;d pull out the word &quot;poison&quot; to describe it.
It&#x27;s nice that Kitty does most of what tmux does built in, but as the author points out, that&#x27;s not really all that helpful for anyone who does any work over ssh.
And to me, bundling all that into a terminal emulator is bloat. Terminals should be terminals. If I want a multiplexer on top of that, I will... use a multiplexer on top of that.
I am potentially sympathetic to the idea that tmux and screen make it harder for terminal developers to add new features to their terminals. I don&#x27;t really know enough about the issues involved to form an opinion. But from the perspective of a regular user, I do not want a multiplexer in my terminal app. When I need one, I prefer to reach for an app-agnostic multiplexer like tmux or screen.</span>

                              <span>I feel like there&#x27;s some semantic slippage around the meaning of the word &quot;accuracy&quot; here.
I grant you, my print Encyclopedia Britannica is not 100% accurate. But the difference between it and a LLM is not just a matter of degree: there&#x27;s a &quot;chain of custody&quot; to  information that just isn&#x27;t there with a LLM.
Philosophers have a working definition of knowledge as being (at least†) &quot;justified true belief.&quot;
Even if a LLM is right most of the time and yields &quot;true belief&quot;, it&#x27;s not justified belief and therefore cannot yield knowledge at all.
Knowledge is Google&#x27;s raison d&#x27;etre and they have no business using it unless they can solve or work around this problem.

                              <span>Almost a month ago I had a problem. Information overload. I had filled up all my free time with audiobooks and podcasts. Every free moment I was consuming information. It was getting frustrating. My general productivity was going down as well. So I quit cold turkey.
This wasn&#x27;t the first time I had done this. At first, it was uncomfortable but I got used to my company. Like meeting an old friend after a long time. The ideas just started flowing and I needed an outlet, I found one in writing.
My writing process is simple. I spend time with myself as much as I can. I let the ideas flow till I feel almost compelled to write them down. It is like the compulsion and excitement of picking up the controller of your favorite video game. Sometimes though I don&#x27;t feel like writing a post but I push through and kinda get myself in that state because consistency is important.
All of this was not planned. I let myself flow with life instead of overthinking and getting in my own way. A lot of this creative stuff is undefined and weird. Yes, your process needs some essence of discipline and consistency. But you just kinda let it flow in a sense. And get out of your own way as fast as possible.
The last part sounds all woo-woo to my logical brain but this has been my experience with the art of writing so far.</span>

                              <span>There is a lot of well-meaning advice on the internet, including this blog. Gives you some new insights. Maybe some insights you knew and had to relearn. It makes you feel good. And you move on to the next advice without ever implementing it. I know, I have been there.
Just do the work is probably another advice people will read, feel good about, and move on. But as a recovering productivity addict, I have to say this - &#x27;Stop reading all kinds of cool things about how to do great work, feel good about yourself for a few days or hours, and not change a single thing in your life&#x27;.
There is a lot of alpha in just doing the work. If you are not doing the work. JUST DO THE WORK. All the nifty tricks and mental models and whatnot are just icing on the cake. They are supposed to make the &#x27;Just do the work&#x27; part easier with time. But you gotta get started.
Start in a dumb inefficient way but start. You are better than the guy reading about all this and not doing anything.</span>

First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>

                              <span>This was the week of rebukes for Israel: On Monday, the ICC requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, on Wednesday three European nations, Ireland, Spain and Norway, recognized Palestinian statehood and on Friday the ICJ ordered Israel to halt its military operations in Rafah, open the border crossings for humanitarian aid and allow international investigators into Gaza. Has the international community finally run out of patience with Israeli intransigence?

                              <span>I will forever treasure my ICQ memories.
The sounds it made. The moving image when it was connecting. Listening in Winamp to one of only a few dozen possible songs that I had carefully downloaded.
Being able to randomly connect to people you would filter. Yes, I want to talk to someone more or less my age but in Iceland. Or any other country.
But most of all, the feeling of being connected. As a teenager in the autism spectrum, that was one of the best feelings I had at that time.
Most people don’t get it when I say this, maybe someone here will, but to me it all started going downhill when people all of a sudden switched to a worse alternative, MSN. I see a direct line from there to the annoying easy-to-accept-while-hard-to-reject-but-always-there-anyway cookie pop-ups.
And no, this is isn’t some form of Ostalgie where we long for past days of hardship with tender feelings. ICQ just had a great user experience as far as I am concerned and to this day I prefer it to existing alternatives from WhatsApp to Webex chat (don’t mention Teams please, I’m having a poetic moment). It was rather a feeling that perhaps other Brazilians will share: a longing, saudade, for the simpler (yes) but better and more poetic 90s, when ICQ connected you to a world that watched Brazil win the fourth World Cup, Ayrton Senna was inspiring generations to be healthier and their better selves and Mamonas Assassinas could only make us laugh, not cry…
So long, ICQ. You will always be part of why I love the internet.
PS: I realize the timing of those events doesn’t necessarily align. But sentimentally they do.</span>

                              <span>Given the level of impact that this incident caused, I am surprised that the remediations did not go deeper. They ensured that the same problem could not happen again in the same way, but that&#x27;s all. So some equivalent glitch somewhere down the road could lead to a similar result (or worse; not all customers might have the same &quot;robust and resilient architectural approach to managing risk of outage or failure&quot;).
Examples of things they could have done to systematically guard against inappropriate service termination / deletion in the future:
1. When terminating a service, temporarily place it in a state where the service is unavailable but all data is retained and can be restored at the push of a button. Discard the data after a few days. This provides an opportunity for the customer to report the problem.
2. Audit all deletion workflows for all services (they only mention having reviewed GCVE). Ensure that customers are notified in advance whenever any service is terminated, even if &quot;the deletion was triggered as a result of a parameter being left blank by Google operators using the internal tool&quot;.
3. Add manual review for any termination of a service that is in active use, above a certain size.
Absent these broader measures, I don&#x27;t find this postmortem to be in the slightest bit reassuring. Given the are-you-f*ing-kidding-me nature of the incident, I would have expected any sensible provider who takes the slightest pride in their service, or even is merely interested in protecting their reputation, to visibly go over the top in ensuring nothing like this could happen again. Instead, they&#x27;ve done the bare minimum. That says something bad about the culture at Google Cloud.</span>

  This figure compares the prediction performance of GPT and quantitative models based on machine learning. Stepwise Logistic follows Ou and Penman (1989)’s structure with their 59 financial predictors. ANN is a three-layer artificial neural network model using the same set of variables as in Ou and Penman (1989). GPT (with CoT) provides the model with financial statement information and detailed chain-of-thought prompts. We report average accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions) for each method (left) and F1 score (right). We obtain bootstrapped standard errors by randomly sampling 1,000 observations 1,000 times and include 95% confidence intervals.</span>

                              <span>Convictions are important in life. If you don&#x27;t have strong convictions you will find yourself going wherever the next opinionated and charismatic person you meet points you.  But it is important to choose them wisely.
What if your conviction is that penguins can fly, they only need the right motivation? So you spend your life trying to give motivational speeches to penguins. Hoping one of them will fly. You will even meet people with similarly strong convictions. Form a strong community. Make derogatory memes about the &#x27;others&#x27; who believe in things like the &#x27;scientific method&#x27; and so on.
And your ego attaches itself tightly to your penguin motivator persona. So anyone trying to challenge you is attacking you and your community. So you viciously attack this person back. Congratulations. You are now in a toxic pointless echo chamber.
The only solution is selecting convictions using first principles. Employ the scientific method. Be open to being challenged as long as the challenge comes through solid first principles thinking as well. All the while keeping the ego in check.
So in essence develop an egoless conviction. Be open to being challenged. Don&#x27;t end up in pointless toxic echo chambers.</span>

The Press in Claremont, California is, and has, been my favorite restaurant for years. it&#x27;s where my family would go to eat before I was born, where my teenage cousin revealed to them that she was pregnant with my cousins, where my parents would go on date nights before I came around. and now it&#x27;s gone.
they closed it in 2020 with lockdown, and their website has said they were coming back soon for months, for years. I&#x27;m watching the bear

                              <span>You may have noticed a proliferation of a new essayist archetype on the internet in recent years - the &quot;Mini Navals.&quot; Modeled after angel investor, entrepreneur, and philosopher Naval Ravikant, these mini me&#x27;s desperately want to become the next big thought leader by aping Naval&#x27;s pithy, maxim-filled style. Naval has achieved success through decades of experience, and he reflects on it. In contrast, Mini Navals try to compress &quot;wisdom&quot; into a handful of tweets and blog posts.
Most Mini Navals tend to be in their early-to-mid 20s, still figuring things out but portraying themselves as gurus who have life all figured out. They boldly proclaim hot takes on everything from tech trends to philosophy to politics, with little credibility to back it up other than having read Naval&#x27;s entire archive. With the Mini Navals, it&#x27;s usually just word salad dressed up as profundity.
Sometimes, the best philosophy is just living intentionally without needing to proselytize your process. In a world that could use more wisdom, perhaps we don&#x27;t need so many more mini-versions when the original is still strong.</span>

Title: QUEER – AN ANARCHIST DECONSTRUCTION
Date: 05/19/2009
Source: http://afed.org.uk/queer-an-anarchist-deconstruction/

 So to be queer by its original meaning [1] , isn’t something necessarily offensive, yet still the term evokes great reaction from both supporters, who view the word as self-empowering and those who view the word as somehow offensive. But there is an overt and positive movement that seeks to reclaim what it is to be queer; removing from it, its old meanings of peculiarity and its homophobic connotations and replacing them with a coherent socio-political and intellectual theory that has shaped the politics of gender and sexuality immeasurably. 
 Growing out of the sexual-radicalism of the 1990s (in the USA namely) the word queer has come to …</span>

                              <span>This past Saturday, my little family and I went to Den Haag to vote in the 2024 South African National Election. An experience that has stayed with me all week, eventually morphing into this post.
We arrived at the embassy at 11:00, expecting to be there no more than two hours. Truthfully, we really weren’t prepared for what awaited us.
A common joke (read truthism) among expats is that it’s incredibly easy to identify a South African embassy as it’s generally the only embassy with burglar bars, uncut grass and a queue outside. Walking through the doors of a South African embassy is like walking through a portal linked directly to The Department of Home Affairs in Bellville. It&#x27;s quite a surreal experience actually.
The queue on Saturday was something else. It wrapped around several blocks…</span>

                              <span>Some photographs from the Chinese city of 沈阳 (Shenyang).

I could spend all day browsing these five-story malls. This one boasted restaurants, cafes, daycares, basketball courts, go-karting, and live fish.

Fine dining in 沈阳. These are the food models in the lobby. Outside the frame, my mom is fighting with my aunt and uncle-in-law first to pay the bill, and when she loses that battle, to order fewer items. Lots of 客气 to go around. 

Although it may look the part, those flowers are not lavender. You can&#x27;t see it here, but the whole time we were in Shenyang it looked as though it were snowing. I later learned that the &quot;snow&quot; was actually the seed hairs of the willow and the poplar trees. It looks cool until the fuzz gets in your eyes, on your clothes, everywhere. (source)
老北市
A popular night market in 沈阳 which runs every night. If you&#x27;re there at the right time, you can catch the show with flying drone-powered phoenixes shooting fireworks from their wings. Sadly I don&#x27;t have any good photos of that show — my senses were overwhelmed for most of the night (in a good way).










Night markets have been ruined for me forever. How can anything measure up to that? Not to mention we passed two markets en route to 老北市 that also looked better than anything I&#x27;d ever seen.</span>

                              <span>The term skill issue is thrown around Twitter a lot. It comes from gaming culture. If you can&#x27;t beat a level. It is a skill issue. Just level up and win. If you think about it, it is a powerful term. It gives power to the player.
Applied to life everything is a skill issue. Can&#x27;t do the perfect juggle? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t write awesome distributed performant code? Skill issue. Can&#x27;t convince a penguin to try your awesome new ice cream? You guessed it. Skill issue. It is a powerful mindset. Gives you extreme ownership.
But there is a catch. Do you take ownership of other people&#x27;s shitty behavior? No. You can take ownership of the triggers and environment you perhaps created to lead to that shitty behavior. Especially if you are in positions of power to have a big impact(ie: manager/CEO). Otherwise, constant shitty behavior is their burden to bear. Avoid such people. People rarely change and you don&#x27;t need the negativity in your life.
Here the skill issue is effectively able to isolate and weed out the negativity. This is purely in a professional context. In a more personal context, things are a lot more messy. I don&#x27;t have an answer for that which works. A skill issue on my end. Need more life experience to resolve it.
Make everything a skill issue and just level up!</span>

                              <span>Veterans constitute a significant segment of the male labor force, and understanding labor market disparities between veterans and non‑veterans is an important component of studying disparities in the economy as a whole. In a previous Liberty Street Economics post, we have shown that even relative to a group of comparable non-veterans, veterans have lower employment and labor force participation rates. One year later, we see that veterans continue to experience lower labor market attachment and the employment gap has widened, though the earnings gap has closed.</span>

                              <span>In the fall, I&#x27;ll be moving to a new city to pursue graduate studies. I thought it&#x27;d be a good idea to move in a few months early to get a feel for the area - and also avoid fighting over good areas around campus, especially if I wait too long.
Next week I&#x27;m flying out to visit some apartments. It dawned upon me that this would be the first time where I live truly alone - no housemates, roommates, parents, pets - it&#x27;ll be just me, in a new city. I&#x27;m excited of course, but also quite scared. The thought of being free and landing into a new city is something amazing, but for the first time, I&#x27;m really on my own.
I moved back with my parents to save on rent a year ago. And while I do appreciate them for their generosity, I think it&#x27;s time for me to leave; I&#x27;ve been paying rent with my mental health, something a lot of Asian kids can relate to. I also feel restricted when I came back to the city where I attended high school. It was like I&#x27;m in purgatory: suffering for some time before entering heaven (a place of my own).
It&#x27;s a big step, despite something I&#x27;m excited for. Yet very scary. But if I&#x27;m scared to do it, it&#x27;s exactly because I&#x27;m scared that I should do it.
I think I&#x27;m ready now. Ready to take that big leap, into a new home, nearly a thousand miles away from where I grew up.
The (paper) journal I&#x27;ve kept since 2020 is reaching the last few pages, appropriately. It&#x27;s as if it knew that my journey here was coming to an end, and a new one will begin soon.
I&#x27;ll be buying a new notebook once in Seattle. Only appropriate when closing a chapter, no?</span>

 It’s likely foolhardy to generalize about the life going on inside the encampments and occupations popping up—rhizomatic “liberated zones,” or what a couple decades ago or so would have been called “temporary autonomous zones.” For they won’t last. But like new spring buds unfolding into flowers, turning what seemed a barren landscape into a lush terrain, it’s their ephemerality that offers promise. 
 A muscle memory awakens. 
 One can almost feel those muscles coming back alive, achy at first, but growing stronger, and once exercised, hard to forget. 
 What’s peculiar about this season of self-generated and self-organized…</span>

                              <span>The fundamental selling point of all productivity advice is getting more done in less time. It&#x27;s a good hook. I have over the years consumed a lot of content around productivity. It took me a long time to realise I was making a fundamental mistake.
I assumed I would stumble upon some specific protocol that I can follow perfectly and my life is set. So I have tried it all. All kinds of wake-sleep times. Journaling. All kinds of productivity apps and timing techniques. Trying to get as much damn sunlight in my little eye holes within x minutes of waking up(yes, I had a Huberman era). Nothing worked.
The fundamental mistake in all of this is I thought of my mind as some unmotivated child that I could be strict with and discipline into getting stuff done. But if you have ever taught young children( I have) you will know that discipline and fear only get you so far. Getting them interested in the topic changes the game.
This realisation drastically changed my life. I can get my mind interested in doing things through self-programming. Everyone is different on how to do this. Many of these routines and techniques that we hear about are just outcomes of effective self-programming unique to that individual. Each of us needs to find our unique way.
How to program your mind? You can introspect and the documentation of your mind will reveal itself to you. Also, there are some ways you can make the mind more malleable to programming. I have given a framework I follow for this in my &#x27;Hacking Hardwork&#x27; post.
There is no golden technique that will save you. Only you can save yourself.</span>
