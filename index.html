                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long, long time since I wrote a personal blog post. A lot has happened, and a lot has changed.
Most recently, I started taking ashwagandha again, since it does tone down my anxiety and feelings so I can actually function. I was having panic attacks every night there for a while - I got over that on my own, but I&#x27;m seeking balance so I can make some life improvements.
I moved my blog(well, set up a new one, technically) from weblog.lol to Bear Blog. Of course, since you&#x27;re reading this, you found it. Still at cropp.blog, as always. The old blog will just remain up as an archive at nicolas.weblog.lol, since I don&#x27;t want to copy it all over by hand, my past blog posts have very little value to me. I also have a blog built into my personal website over at nicolas.lol, but I don&#x27;t k…</span>

                              <span>I was listening to a podcast episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where he interviewed Derek Sivers. Sivers told this story about cycling along a beach route. Every time he did this route, he would go as fast as possible, pushing himself. He would always finish his ride in about forty-three minutes, red-faced and sweating, totally exhausted.
Then one day, he decided to take it easy. Instead of going all out, he relaxed and enjoyed the view along the way. When he got to the end of the ride, he checked his time, and it was forty-five minutes. Only two minutes slower than when he’d been pushing himself to the max. He couldn’t believe it. Two minutes slower, and he enjoyed the whole ride. He wasn’t tired or drenched in sweat.
For me this story is a perfect example of how we’re always trying to opti…</span>

Since we all have language and opinions about it, the risk of genericness is high with a title like this. It&#x27;s like this with threads about other universal topics too, such as food or health.</span>

                              <span>This is an important result.
The actual paper [1] says that functional MRI (which is measuring which parts of the brain are active by sensing blood flow) indicates that different brain hardware is used for non-language and language functions.
This has been suspected for years, but now there&#x27;s an experimental result.
What this tells us for AI is that we need something else besides LLMs. It&#x27;s not clear what that something else is. But, as the paper mentions, the low-end mammals and the corvids lack language but have some substantial problem-solving capability. That&#x27;s seen down at squirrel and crow size, where the brains are tiny. So if someone figures out to do this, it will probably take less hardware than an LLM.
This is the next big piece we need for AI. No idea how to do this, but it&#x27;s the right question to work on.

                              <span>Lots of people are asking how good the self driving has to be before we tolerate it. I got a one month free trial of FSD and turned it off after two weeks. Quite simply: it&#x27;s dangerous.
- It failed with a cryptic system error while driving
- It started making a left turn far too early that would have scraped the left side of the car on a sign. I had to manually intervene.
- In my opinion, the default setting accelerates way too aggressively. I&#x27;d call myself a fairly aggressive driver and it is too aggressive for my taste.
- It tried to make way too many right turns on red when it wasn&#x27;t safe to. It would creep into the road, almost into the path of oncoming vehicles.
- It didn&#x27;t merge left to make room for vehicles merging onto the highway. The vehicles then tried to cut in. The system should have avoided an unsafe situation like this in the first place.
- It would switch lanes to go faster on the highway, but then missed an exit on at least one occasion because it couldn&#x27;t make it back into the right lane in time. Stupid.
After the system error, I lost all trust in FSD from Tesla. Until I ride in one and feel safe, I can&#x27;t have any faith that this is a reasonable system. Hell, even autopilot does dumb shit on a regular basis. I&#x27;m grateful to be getting a car from another manufacturer this year.</span>

 Marcos Camacho, better known by his nickname Marcola, is the leader of a criminal organization in São Paulo, Brazil, called Primer Comando de la Capital (PCC, Capital’s First Commando). 
 Marcola’s answers allow us to get a glimpse at what could be the future of common delinquency in Latin America.

Title: Towards Another Uprising
Date: Early October, 2024
Source: Retrieved on October 19, 2024 from https://anarchistnews.org/content/towards-another-uprising

 At the end of 2010 an individual act of despair in the town of Sidi Bouzid ignited a daring, enraged, and joyful upheaval that travelled through North Africa into the Middle East and beyond. People defied the oppressive systems they had been immersed in for generations and came together in the streets to topple the political elites at their helm. The authorities, at first stunned by this courageous spirit that they couldn’t understand, then unleashed a cynical and brutal response. 
 This defeat is still being inflicted on the people in the region, and is also felt all over the world by those who stood in solidari…</span>

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary drea…</span>

Children’s Oppression, Rights, and Liberation, by Samantha Godwin
Excerpt: academia.edu/2046034/Childrens_Oppression_Rights_and_Liberation (Citations Omitted)
 The legal, political, scientific and media discourse prevalent in previous generations promoted the idea that race and gender are biologically determinate categories with biologically determined attributes, characteristics, and social roles. Historically, many anthropologists and psychologists believed they had found physical evidence that non-white people had an inferior capacity for reason and rationality. These supposed differences fit into an imperialist ideology of a ‘white ma…</span>

 After slaughtering more than 42,000 Palestinians, including 16,500 children, the Israeli military is now invading Lebanon and threatening to go to war with Iran. In the following in-depth account, an anarchist from occupied Palestine reviews the history of Zionist colonialism and Palestinian resistance, makes the case for an anti-colonial understanding of the situation, and explores what it means to act in solidarity with Palestinians.

Young and Oppressed, by Brian Dominick and Sara Zia Ebrahimi
 While most common oppressions, such as sexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, even speciesism, have been identified, widely acknowledged, thoroughly discussed and deeply analyzed, one oppression remains largely untouched. This fact is astonishing given that the group oppressed by this ignored injustice is one to which every adult human has once belonged. It is the one oppression with which all humans can identify, having suffered from it directly. It is not an oppression of a tiny minority to which few will ever belong. It is not the oppression of people who can be blamed them…</span>

Why We Can’t Wait, by Adam Fletcher
 “Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor;
 it must be demanded by the oppressed.”
 I look at the people around me
 and see the prisons and traps
 we are all stuck.
 From an early age we are taught and trained:
 sit still, hold on, walk (don’t run),
 and be quiet.
 Whatever you do, be quiet. 
 So we do. We go to polite schools or content jobs.
 We type and read and feel nice.
 Our hair is nice and our hearts are nice.
 We live nice lives. 
 But what if…
 what if we were shown the whole picture
 from the first day?
 What if they said
 “Hey, when you’re poor, you’re screwed.
 If you’re black, …</span>

Documents and Depression, by Kris Anne Bonifacio
 Joaquin Luna’s dream was simple. He wanted to become a civil engineer. But the Texas student’s undocumented status limited his options for the future. Left without hope, the 18-year-old shot himself the day after Thanksgiving last year. In his goodbye letters, Luna expressed despair. In one letter addressed to Jesus Christ, he wrote that he had “no point of existence in this cruel world... I’ve realized that I have no chance in becoming a civil engineer the way I’ve always dreamed of here… so I’m planning on going to you and helping you construct a new temple in heaven.”

Against Parental Rights 
 (Excerpt: academia.edu/19663920/Against_Parental_Rights) 
Samantha Godwin
 There is a significant disjunction between child protectionist theory and rhetoric and the extent of parental powers. The extensive deference to parental preference and discretion seems to have little to do with preserving children’s interests and more to do with parental autonomy. We must conclude that only respect for parental autonomy and freedom, rather than child protection, would lead to the belief that parents ought to be granted rights beyond those narrowly derivable from a child’s interests. This is tr…</span>

The Pedagogy of Religion
Peter Gelderloos
 It was my grandfather’s memorial service, and the Dutch Reform pastor took a break from talking about God and Heaven to the members of the congregation, in which I, as a dutiful grandson, was unfortunately included for the moment, in order to address the children in the audience, the grand-kids and great grand-kids of the deceased, nearly all of them baptized into the Dutch Reform church or a like-minded denomination, as the apple does not fall far from the tree. 
 “Now, you all might be wondering,” began the pastor in a condescending tone, only slightly more exact in…</span>

Mistrust and Things
Layla AbdelRahim
 Since the 1950s of Soviet Russia, Lena Alexeevna Nikitina and Boris Pavlovich Nikitin, have been sounding alarm that children’s most vicious enemy is, in fact, adults’ mistrust that begins with holding the child when she walks, helping her up when she falls, forbidding her to climb “dangerous” stairs even on the primitive children’s playgrounds marked “for use between 0–3 years old”, picking up the child and sticking her on the slide, constantly telling her what to do or not, what to wear, eat, feel, know, think, and so on, in other words, exercising total control.

I Am
 DAVID: A younger version of myself waits for the bus after school. My friend starts to tell me some of the jokes about “illegals” he knows. I look visibly uncomfortable and he acknowledges it: “You shouldn’t take it personally” he says with a smirk, “I mean, unless you’re ‘illegal.’ “ I freeze and then fumble to change the subject. His reasoning is perfectly sound. Why would I be offended unless I was “illegal”? I take the bus home thinking what a close call that was, and I start to plan how I’ll make it so that this never happens again. I become super-conscious of the potential trajectory of conversatio…</span>

There Is a Better Way
Vicki Larson
 The pressures and pace of modern life has made parents and children stressed and miserable. With the rise of dual-earning families, mothers, and increasingly, fathers are struggling with work-life issues, forcing many to lean in or opt out. But is it truly modern life that’s at fault or is it our expectation that two people – whether hetero or same-sex – can do it alone and do it well? Is the nuclear family all it’s cracked up to be? 
 Despite the belief that monogamous male-female bonding is how mothers and children were supported and thrived, the anthropologist Sarah Blaff…</span>

Adult Education (TED Transcript) 
Adora Svitak
 Now, I want to start with a question: When was the last time you were called “childish”? For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior, or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush. Ask yourself, who’s responsible? Adults.

Abstract
 This paper analyses the development of the schism between Marxism and anarchism and explores two distinct methodological approaches to investigating these apparently discrete ideologies: one is derived from analytic political philosophy; the other is an adaptation of Michael Freeden’s conceptual approach. The former views the division between Marxism and anarchism as the result of a clear distinction in universal principles, an account that is found to be flawed. Using the alternative conceptual approach, this paper argues that the schism that marked the rela…</span>

 This article, foremost, is a response to a critique published on my work Against Individualism by a certain Aleph. In short, Aleph is not convinced of my account of the Creative Nothing and is concerned with a “Christian” basis for my mystical methods — among other minutiae. This, he feels, undermines my reading of the apophatic, unsayable Self beyond self, and problematizes my relationship to pagan authors like the divine Plotinus and Porphyry. I will explore all of these in-depth, as I am always one for meaningless chatter. However, t…</span>

Abstract
 In recent years, the discussion about economic concepts different from both capitalism and central planning has gotten more interest, new ideas emerged, and old ideas were rediscovered. This paper presents a modern version of the economic concept of anarcho-communist planning, originating from the late 19th century. The proposed idea is based on the needs of the people while respecting the planetary boundaries. It rejects ideas like markets, work remuneration, and money or other universal units of account. This paper first discusses the shortcomings of markets, central planning, and previous post-capitalist …</span>

Current context
 The current condition of queer communities is paradoxically one of the best and one of the worst we&#x27;ve seen in modern capitalist Western societies. Sixty years of continuous mobilization by the queer movement (and protoqueer before it, if we consider all the developments of the gay and lesbian movements) have led to the legalization and almost total emancipation of our communities within the bourgeois state legal system. We can now, as never before, exist openly within society, putting on our true faces. Yet material violence against…</span>

abstract
 In the early 1960s, a number of anarchist writers showed an interest in cybernetics, in which they saw the tools for better articulating radical forms of self-organisation. Discussions on the connections between anarchism and cybernetics did not advance very far, however, and by the 1970s the topic seems to have fallen off the anarchist radar. With an increase in interest in cybernetics over the last few years, this paper picks up where these debates left off and highlights some …</span>

 “We tend to destroy our leaders with criticism, often personal and vicious.” 
 — Lierre Keith, Deep Green Resistence 
Looting the Corpses That Come Before You
 I’m not here to praise or condemn Caesar, but to make sure he stays buried. Often when a movement falls (and Deep Green Resistance is very much falling) there is a “nostalgic” tendency to attempt to exhume the corpse and at least loot it for a few precious baubles. Part of this necrophilia is the belief that to have persisted or to have attained some notability entails a certain degre…</span>

                              <span>So the end of life for Windows 10 looms ahead of us, which is a problem because Windows 11 has two fundamental problems, as it currently stands:
First, it just won&#x27;t run on the majority of hardware that currently runs Windows 10. This isn&#x27;t just, like, ancient hardware; I have a desktop gaming PC that is perfectly fine to play current-gen AAA games on; it&#x27;s what I played Cyberpunk 2077 on and that was totally okay. But somehow it doesn&#x27;t meet Win11 requirements because of the CPU; it has a Ryzen 5 1600X in it, a CPU from 2017 that is apparently still actively being manufactured.
Moore&#x27;s law has been dead for a while, so the long plateauing of, particularly, CPU power has meant that some of this hardware has a looong shelf life. I still haven&#x27;t run into a game I want to play on PC that is c…</span>

They invited me to dinner tonight, which I originally accepted and then canceled when I found out they were going at 9:30. Who meets for dinner at 9:30? Under normal circumstances I likely would have swallowed my objections and gone, but I&#x27;ve been burning the candle at both ends this week and I have to get up early tomorrow to catch a flight out of EWR.
Work was surprisingly busy today. My director (my manager&#x27;s supervisor) flew in from London and asked to meet me in person, so I went into the office and took a call with him. It went okay. I felt a little nervous because my manager told me to lead the meeting minutes before it started, and afterwards she gave me some constructive criticism about how I could have better fa…</span>

                              <span>Recently, I began reading Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman. I&#x27;ve been trying to distance myself from self-help/psychology/philosophy books, but I saw someone on reddit make an interesting post regarding some content in the book, so I decided to give it a read.

The book is designed so that you read one micro chapter a day for four weeks. Mr. Burkeman discusses a topic and gives you time to reflect on it. I think this is wise, since in so many situations with books offering advice/guidance, you are so overwhelmed with information that by the end of it you&#x27;re lucky to walk away with one or two nuggets of wisdom.
I reached chapter three recently, and it stuck with me enough to want to write a bit about it. But before I do that, let&#x27;s go back in time, sometime around 1995 in Orlando,…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;re going to have outages in production. They&#x27;re inevitable. The question is how to best minimize outages, both their frequency and duration.
Common wisdom advocates for using managed k8s and databases, containerized services, horizontal scaling for redundancy, building images in CI/CD, and defining your infrastructure as code. This is Best Practice™, and no one was ever fired for doing that. In fact it&#x27;s quite good for your resumé.
I will argue that such common wisdom is wrong. These tools are complex, and complex infrastructure is a wildly net-negative distraction to your business and inherently risky.
Over the past 10 years I&#x27;ve run services in production with millions of customers, exceeding 4-9&#x27;s uptime. During that time I experimented with a wide variety of architectures, starting…</span>

                              <span>Because the actual process of upgrading Postgres is terrible.
I say this as someone who absolutely loves using it, but the actual process of upgrading Postgres is something that takes significant downtime, is error-prone and you&#x27;re often better off just dumping all the databases and reimporting them in a new folder. (A good idea in general since it&#x27;ll vacuum and compact indexes as well if you do it, combining a few maintenance routines in your upgrade path.)
It requires having the previous version of Postgres installed, something which can mess with a number of distro policies (not to mention docker, which is the most popular way to deploy software that will typically rely on Postgres), and unlike most software with that issue, Postgres is software you want to be managed by your distro.
Therefore, most people only upgrade by necessity - when their distro forces the upgrade or the version they&#x27;re using reaches EOL.</span>

Editor’s note: We think we know what democracy is. But do we? Anthropologist David Graeber burst into national consciousness in 2011 with the Occupy movement he helped to spark. The author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years has written a daring book about democracy in America: its origins, its opponents, and its chances of happening today given the stranglehold of the wealthy on our economic and political systems.

RACHAEL KIDDEY: Each year, the ISRF team up with a different university to co-produce a workshop. This year we’re working with Professor Charles Stewart from UCL. The theme of the workshop is ‘Discovery &amp; Recognition’. That is, that as social scientists our work constantly surprises us. May I ask for your thoughts on the theme?

Aro Velmet: When you visited Estonia in 2003 and spoke about the Movement for Global Justice, it was a pretty bleak time for progressives.

 If you’ve ever spent 15 minutes listening to the same U2 song while on hold to your mobile-phone provider because the 27 people you’ve spoken to so far have no idea who the hell you are, you’ll know all about the throb in the ass that is bureaucracy. Our lives fundamentally suck because of it. 
 David Graeber—the anthropologist who wrote the international best seller Debt: The First 5,000 years (a book Russell Brand says will “make you cleverer”)—argues in his new book, The Utopia of Rules, that we’re trapped in jobs created by the ruling classes to feed into their debt-extraction schemes.

 Recently, Switzerland’s government has agreed to vote on implementing a Basic Income. If it passes, then Switzerland will be one of the first countries to introduce a Basic Income. 
 The Basic Income theory or system has been floating around in many different intellectual circles. Less than a week ago Sam Altman of Y-Combinator wrote an essay on it. And there is a whole subreddit devoted to it. 
 I’m not surprised by its popularity. Most people could really use some extra cash each month, ipso facto a lot of people want the Basic Income.

David Graeber is an anthropologist, anarchist, the author of Debt: the First 5,000 Years, a professor at Goldsmith’s, University of London, and one of the organizers of Occupy Wall Street, which is the subject of his forthcoming book. Bookforum spoke with the writer in Los Angeles about the future of anthropology, ecstatic moments in activism, and the problem of political imagination.

Not since Dilbert has truth been spoken to power in soulless work settings. But the cartoon character’s successor may be David Graeber. In 2013 he achieved viral fame with cubicle zombies everywhere after he published a short essay on the prevalence of work that had no social or economic reason to exist, which he called “bullshit jobs”. The wide attention seemed to confirm his thesis.
Mr Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, has expanded on the ideas in a recent book. He responded to five questions from The Economist’s Open Future initiative. He rails against “feudal retinues of basically useless flunkies.” …</span>

 In March 2020, when the virus raged across the globe but before we in the UK realised how serious and tragically lethal it would become or how much of a long-term problem it would be, Freedom Press published its first Covid-related update on its news site. Titled Covid Mutual Aid Groups: A List, the text came out ten days before the first UK lockdown and stated: 
 “As the global Covid-19 pandemic is upon us, a number of mutual aid groups have started forming across the country. (...) It is estimated that 2–3 people out of a hundred [infected by Covid] will die. We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening. (...) The Tory government…</span>

A few years ago David Graeber’s mother had a series of strokes. Social workers advised him that, in order to pay for the home care she needed, he should apply for Medicaid, the US government health insurance programme for people on low incomes. So he did, only to be sucked into a vortex of form filling and humiliation familiar to anyone who’s ever been embroiled in bureaucratic procedures.

I am so very sad to hear that David Graeber died yesterday in Italy at the age of 59. David was not only brilliant, but he was genuine, accessible, and passionate. What a huge, immeasurable loss, could 2020 be any worse? Here is an interview I did with David in 2005 when he was wrongfully fired from his post at Yale. RIP friend.

London-based anthropologist David Graeber talks to Christopher Lydon about the recent UK elections and potential change to come. This interview originally appeared at Radio Open Source.
 David Graeber emerged as something of a cult writer behind the Occupy movement of six years ago. He’s a Yale-trained cultural anthropologist, meaning in his case, he’s a tracker of the invisible stitching around matters of debt and wealth from ancient times. He has prophesied at different times a standard 15-hour work week and the dissolution of the US empire. In …</span>

READING:
A few years ago i started reading Saga, the comic written by  Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by the talented Fiona Staples. Not quite sure why I stopped reading it but decided to pick it up again. I bought the box set Vol 1-9! And it arrived today so i&#x27;m v excited to jump back into this world.

Saga Vol. 1
WATCHING:
Only Murders in the Building. I adore this show and so glad it&#x27;s back on. Can I please live in a fancy building like this and befriend a couple of peculiar yet distinguished fellows, but instead of solving murders, we just make zines and talk books?
WEB HEARTS 🧹 WEB FINDS:
On work and capitalism: how to escape the tyranny of work under capitalism.
MUCH MUSIC Stamps!
Eden Clifton&#x27;s pottery is adorable.
I need this Snoopy sweatshirt in my life. Idk, but lately, I&#x27;ve been nostalgic for cutesy childhood things for comfort.
Been enjoying reading  Morning Music these days. I like their concept of sharing what they&#x27;re listening to over morning coffee.
These tiny handmade dolls by myrtlemakes are so precious! I&#x27;m inspired to make little things like this. New hobby, perhaps?</span>

                              <span>One piece of pop psychology that actually seems to be true is the premise that at any given time we are all doing the best we can. Football coaches and motivational speakers may beg to differ, but they have a vested interest in making people think that they can always just try harder to achieve success by whatever definition is popular that day. I don&#x27;t buy it. I believe that people want to succeed. They want to be good parents, good employees, good spouses. Hell, they just want to be good. In the real world though we are faced with all kinds of mundane challenges, from differing energy levels, differing states of mental clarity and motivational levels that rise and fall on a sea of different inputs.

                              <span>I run NewsBlur[0] and I’ve been battling this issue of NewsBlur fetching 403s across the web for months now. My users are revolting and asking for refunds. I’ve tried emailing dozens of site owners and publishers and only two of them have done the work of whitelisting their RSS feed. It’s maddening and is having a real negative effect on NewsBlur.
NewsBlur is an open-source RSS news reader (full source available at [1]), something we should all agree is necessary to support the open web! But Cloudflare blocking all of my feed fetchers is bizarre behavior. And we’re on the verified bots list for years, but it hasn’t made a difference.
Let me know what I can do. NewsBlur publishes a list of IPs that it uses for feed fetching that I&#x27;ve shared with Cloudflare but it hasn&#x27;t made a difference.
I&#x27;m hoping Cloudflare uses the IP address list that I publish and adds them to their allowlist so NewsBlur can keep fetching (and archiving) millions of feeds.

Rather than what many BigTech companies are currently doing: &quot;Wall Street says we need to &#x27;Use AI Somehow&#x27;. Let&#x27;s invest in AI and Find Things To Do with AI. Later, we&#x27;ll worry about somehow matching these things with user needs.&quot;</span>

                              <span>As central banks shrink their balance sheets to restore price stability and phase out expansionary programs, gauging the ampleness of reserves has become a central topic to policymakers and academics alike. The reason is that the ampleness of reserves informs when to slow and then stop quantitative tightening (QT). The Federal Reserve, for example, implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, whereby the quantity of reserves in the banking system needs to be large enough such that everyday changes in reserves do not cause large variations in short-term rates. The goal is therefore to implement QT while ensuring that reserves remain sufficiently ample. In this post, we review how to gauge the ampleness of reserves using the new Reserve Demand Elasticity (RDE) measure, which will be published monthly on the public website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a standalone product.</span>

                              <span>I have a pretty old paperwhite. When it started deleting books i had side-loaded via calibre, I decided to get a kobo. I have a libra color, and I have to say: price notwithstanding, it&#x27;s a great device. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with more recent devices, but compared to my 2nd gen paperwhite, it is _amazing_.
Color is good enough to read comic books on it, the google drive integration means it&#x27;s not too hard to get my CBR/CBZ files on directly. The annotation / notetaking featureas are nice (I haven&#x27;t leaned into them yet, but they work well even on the small screen size), plus all the regular stuff with normal book reading. Also, since it&#x27;s kobo/rakuten, the libby integration is better (search and select library books right from the device).
The actual reading app is maybe 90% as good as reading on the kindle (or a more specialized reader like perfectviewer on android). There&#x27;s some annoyingly fiddly features- font size is kind of weirdly variable, when going through CBR files there&#x27;s no &quot;read next in the folder&quot; gesture nor is there a &quot;this is read/unread&quot; state in the google drive ui, so you always have to remember which book you are finishing when opening the next in the series.
I tried out one of those boox readers with the android apps, which would be even better software-wise, but the boox hardware seems like garbage (for an N&#x3D;1 at least). My display came with several rows of stuck pixels, and apparently it&#x27;s a good thing that I ordered from amazon instead of the boox store, because the reviews indicate getting an RMA from boox directly is a pain.</span>

I have a sneaking suspicion that the real real reason for an NPU is marketing. &quot;Oh look, NVDA is worth $3.3T - let&#x27;s make sure we stick some AI stuff in our products too.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I think the results show that just in general the compute is not used well. That the CPU took 8.4ms and GPU took 3.2ms shows a very small gap. I&#x27;d expect more like 10x - 20x difference here.
I&#x27;d assume that the onnxruntime might be the issue. I think some hardware vendors just release the compute units without shipping proper support yet. Let&#x27;s see how fast that will change.
Also, people often mistake the reason for an NPU is &quot;speed&quot;. That&#x27;s not correct. The whole point of the NPU is rather to focus on low power consumption. To focus on speed you&#x27;d need to get rid of the memory bottleneck. Then you end up designing your own ASIC with it&#x27;s own memory. The NPUs we see in most devices are part of the SoC around the CPU to offload AI computations.
It would be interesting to run this benchmark in a infinite loop for the three devices (CPU, NPU, GPU) and measure power consumption.
I&#x27;d expect the NPU to be lowest and also best in terms of &quot;ops/watt&quot;</span>

                              <span>Unsubscribe links are a fantastic regulation, but there is a workaround. I must have received at least a dozen emails from Brown after graduating despite unsubscribing to every email they sent.
The trouble is they&#x27;re endlessly creative about the lists they put you on. I&#x27;d get one email from &quot;Alumni Connections&quot; and then another from &quot;Faculty Spotlight&quot; and then another from &quot;Global Outreach&quot; and then another from &quot;Event Invitations, 2023 series&quot;. I&#x27;m making those names up because I forget exactly what they were called, but you get the idea. I hope this was in violation of the regulation: surely you can&#x27;t invent a new mailing list that didn&#x27;t used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it individually.
They finally stopped after I sent them an angry email.</span>

                              <span>When people try and say that regulating stuff like this is impossible, I often think about how unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are.
There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email (it seems like they’re forced to say “Unsubscribe” and not use weasel words to hide the link) I’m either immediately unsubscribed from the person who sent me the email, or I’m taken to a page which seemingly MUST have a “remove me from all emails” option.
The level of compliance (and they can’t even do malicious compliance!) with this is absurd. If these new rules work anything like that, they’ll be awesome. Clearly regulating behavior like this is indeed possible.</span>

 David Graeber has spent the last decade challenging the line drawn between scholar and activist. While many academics fancy themselves “radicals,” the anthropologist professor has been an active participant in anarchist and anti-authoritarian groups and organizing. Graeber has used his skill-set as an anthropologist to compile ethnographic data—far away from the classroom and campus, to be sure—regarding the contemporary anarchist movement in North America; the results were published in 2009 as Direct Action: An Ethnography. David Graeber is the author of several books, including Fragment…</span>

 David Graeber is one of the world’s leading anthropologists and a well-known activist who played an important role in the early days of Occupy Wall Street in New York. In this wide-ranging interview for ROAR’s third issue, he speaks about the unexpected history of inequality, the role of debt in contemporary capitalism, the nature of money as a social relation, the violent and self-destructive logic of financialization, the class power of the 1 percent, and the challenges of building a radical-democratic movement against the rule of finance.

 Odd things happened in fall 2011 as Occupy Wall Street began to inhabit down- town Manhattan. People rode the subway carrying signs that touted the merits of the Glass-Steagall Act; they started sidewalk conversations about corporate person-hood and about the social purpose of derivatives. Legislation, legal precedent, and financial products that had once been obscure emerged in public in new ways.

By political conviction, he is an anarchist that advocates real, direct democracy, and is widely regarded for his contribution to the Occupy Wall Street movement especially in the early days of its creation when the organizational structure was decided; Graeber worked in the favor of more horizontal movement that would break with the tradition of hierarchical way of …</span>

 Six months ago, while preparing to interview David Graeber, I decided to conduct some brief internet research on the renowned anthropologist and activist. Although critically acclaimed in academic circles (he has been described as ‘the best anthropological theorist of his generation’), I was surprised to find relatively little on the man and his work – save a few articles and interviews regarding his involvement in various alter-globalisation movements over the past decade, a few more concerning his controversial departure from Yale, (he now teaches at Goldsmiths University of London), and of course, the odd intellectual dispute with S…</span>

Hello! A Youtube video essayist I follow on Bluesky (Big Joel if you know of him) posted this:
“How do you become a person who just really likes doing work? I thought having a very interesting job would do it but this has not paid off as you might expect”
The first two people I thought of who give me the impression they enjoy their jobs are you and Bruno Dias, so I was wondering if you had an answer for this (because I sure don’t!)
I was slightly taken aback by this, as one often is when one sees one&#x27;s name in print unexpectedly, and I had to pick apart a little this idea that I give the impression that I enjoy my job.
I certainly have talked very positively about my work in public; I believe most readers should be familiar with the old (but…</span>

If they didn&#x27;t then why do they have the urge to socialize with friends or family? Okay so we chat with the people we love, so what? Why would I need to blog? For those that tell me that their journal is their blog I do not disagree that it isn&#x27;t important. The only difference is that your written word now has an audience. Gasp! Being perceived?! This can be scary to some but let&#x27;s look at the positive aspects of blogging.
First, there are no rules to blogging. Blogs serve different purposes depending on the person. For example, this blog you are reading is a personal blog that doesn&#x27;t have a specific focus or target audience. I just …</span>

                              <span>I used to be obsessed with timelines.
When I was young and naive, I had a list of things I wanted to accomplish by specific points in my life. Some of those goals included:
Five years after earning my degree, I should be making a certain amount of money.
By 25, I should be engaged, and shortly after, should be married.
By a certain age, I should have a specific number of children.
Before that, I should own a particular kind of house in a specific location.
And so on, and so on.
Life is a fickle thing. I was young and didn’t fully grasp that wanting to achieve something by a certain time didn’t guarantee I would actually do it then.
Having a goal was good for me. During those 5 years, I worked really hard to reach a specific point in my career to hit that number. What was not helpful was be…</span>

Bullying Health
Elena Hagopyan
 As soon as you got any “bigger” health problem, you’re basically in trouble, not only by the things you’re facing by your condition, but actually the opinion is far harder. Today it is better to be some picture perfect child, young person or adult, as otherwise, you will be looked down upon by others. The silly of it is the fact no one is picture perfect, everyone who seems this way, it is just an act.

Condemned and Hated
Isis Nelson
 Adults have consistently ignored young opinions and voices forever. It’s taught to us that we should respect our elders, because they’re old, and not speak unless spoken to by an adults. They constantly fail to protect and help us. The history of our world is filled with young people and children being failed by adults and losing their rights. From birth, we’re told that we are inherently inferior. Year after year, young people’s ideas are shot down by older relatives, older siblings, teachers, professors, leaders, bosses, etc. Our ambitious, often progressive, ideals and value…</span>

 The anarchist movement in the United States has had the support of leading libertarian intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky; but it has lacked a figure who could transform its guiding principles into something resembling a political movement. In the autumn of 2011, David Graeber seemed to be the man who could drag anarchism into mainstream politics. 
 Graeber, along with other leading figures in the Occupy movement, coined the term ‘we are the 99 percent’. The catchphrase caught on, and within weeks — with the assistance of social media — Occupy transformed a small group of idealists…</span>

Qalandar Bux Memon: Can you explain why you support horizontal organisation, collective assemblies and a dialogical method for organising for social change as opposed to the vertical left party?
 David Gaeber: I like to make the distinction between forms of organization that could exist outside structures of coercion – that is, in the absence of any ability to call up men armed with weapons to threaten anyone who refuses to go along with a decision – and those which could not. It seems to me it’s the responsibility of those who are trying to create a free society to do so through forms of organization that cou…</span>

 David Graeber is an anthropologist and a well-known anarchist figure. He was one of the initiators of the Occupy movement in 2011. He is the author of a major essay, Debt, the First 5,000 Years. I met him in Paris for the release of his latest book, The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy.
Back in 2011, you were among the initiators of the Occupy movement. Several similar social movements have happened ever since, but it seems none of them managed to stay alive long enough to reach their…</span>

 David Graeber: It’s not really Yale’s leadership so much as the Department of Anthropology and senior faculty who decided to cut me off. For a long time I really tried to avoid getting involved in campus politics. I thought that I had come up with a nice formula, that I would be an activist in New York and simply a scholar here in New Haven. 
 Generally speaking, the academy really doesn’t care what you say and think or what you write, so long as you don’t do anything. If you’re willing to be a hypocrite, they’re fine with you, whatever you espouse. On the other hand, if there’s any sign that you might actually liv…</span>

 In his latest book, David Graeber, the best-selling author of Debt: The First 5000 Years, argues that many jobs today are essentially pointless — or, as the book’s title calls them, Bullshit Jobs. 
 Jacobin Radio’s Suzi Weissman sat down with Graeber to find out what bullshit jobs are and why they’ve proliferated in recent years. 
A Taxonomy
Suzi Weissman: Let’s just get right down to it. What is the definition of a bullshit job?

Editor’s Note: Conservative proponents of the guaranteed income want a lump sum payment (Charles Murray suggests about $11,000 to all adults) to replace existing social welfare programs and downsize American bureaucracy. But some leftists oppose those government welfare agencies, too, London School of Economics professor David Graeber says. The leftist critique of private and public bureaucracies, Graeber explains, is that they “employ thousands of people to make us feel bad about ourselves.” 
 Bureaucrats pushing paper decide what we and our work are worth. But somewhat ironically, Graeber suggests, it’s those bu…</span>

 David Graeber, a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, is a man who wears many hats. He’s an academic, of course — and a respected one at that. But he’s also an author, an activist and political anarchist. But his most unique attribute may be this: He’s an honest-to-God public intellectual in an era when such figures are few and far between.

Apparently it’s a game where you take turns swinging a chestnut on a string and trying to hit the opponent’s chestnut and break it. Yes, I can see how a steel fake chestnut would be an advantage here, though I’m amazed it wouldn’t be instantly obvious to even a casual observer that the look and sound were wrong. So maybe I’m still missing something.</span>

                              <span>Founder of Gouach, the repairable (and fireproof!) e-bike battery mentioned in the article, happy to answer any question!
- we salvaged 100s of discarded e-bike batteries
- we found that 90% of components were like new
- batteries were thrown away because of the spot-welding and the glue which prevents repairability
- we spent 2 years (and 5 patents) to design a robust, safe, and easy to assemble system that requires nothing but a screwdriver
Our batteries have been in use since 2 years in the streets of France, on micro-mobility e-bikes, in the harshest possible conditions (rain, snow, cold, heat, shocks), and we&#x27;re very happy with their performances!
We&#x27;re now opening it to the general public (for conversion kits, and to replace old batteries that are no longer manufactured)
We plan to open-source at least part of the embedded software, so people can write extensions (to let their battery &quot;talk&quot; with any e-bike system, and share it — using WASM embeddable code — to other people on the web!)
Let&#x27;s fight planned obsolescence!
(and if you&#x27;re looking for a new battery, there&#x27;s 25% off on https://get.gouach.com)</span>

                              <span>This year I started my magister degree in programming, and it fucking sucked from the very beginning of the bachelors, to be honest. I constantly regret &quot;my&quot; choice (my dad is a programmer, and I sorta wanted to make him proud, but there was no pressure from him or anybody else) to start all this. I long for history, literature, philosophy, languages and human psychology constantly. I try to self-study some of this, but university studying takes most of my time and mental capacity. IT just feels like it is not for me. I want to understand our situation as humans on this tiny planet. I feel this void inside of me every day. I feel like this year I will eventually fail my studies due to numerous mental breakdowns. Fuck it, I will be someone else in the end.</span>

                              <span>Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I&#x27;m trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.
If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it&#x27;s the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I&#x27;m trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.
Simon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.
I keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I&#x27;ve received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.
Knowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board. He then wrote each of these messages out by hand (suffering only minor carpel tunnel) on sticky notes which the bear now carries like a human bear directional.

It now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.
These are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they&#x27;ve been listened to and understood. That don&#x27;t cost much money but are priceless at the same time.
I&#x27;m grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you&#x27;re subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.
