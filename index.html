The most significant recent escalation in the ongoing Zionist real estate project, enabled by apartheid and genocide of the Palestinian people, occurred on October 7th, 2023, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s prison fence, carrying out a bloody incursion on Israeli military installations and border towns. Since, the Israel “Defense” Forces (IDF) have engaged in the offensive flattening of Gaza, destruction of its infrastructure, extensive land seizure and elimination, torture and expulsion of its Palestinian population.

Björn Höcke, its boss in Thuringia, one of its three best-known national leaders and its main rabble-rouser, has never concealed his admiration for Germany’s days of swastika glory.

So at his next rally he shouted only ”Alles für…” and let them add the missing word. Openly racist and viciously anti-immigrant, his party pushed most other parties in a similar direction – to keep their voters. But it kept on growing, despite countless organized anti-AfD rallies and marches. More

                              <span>I came across a comment &#x3D;&#x3D;post&#x3D;&#x3D; (now deleted) on X the other day that said, &quot;man, if you&#x27;re indian and trying to make some bread, first thing is change your name online, Rachid Deepak Kumar does not transmit competence, i&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s facts.&quot;
This person was arguing that having an Indian name can be a hindrance when trying to do business online.
I don&#x27;t think the issue is limited to Indians. I&#x27;ve worked with SaaS makers from mainland China who choose not to reveal they are from China and sometimes use alternate names online. They do this because of perceived negative stereotypes about quality and reliability that can come with a &quot;Made in China&quot; label.
It seems national stereotypes can also influence perceptions regardless of actual ability or experience. As someone with over a decade of professional experience working mostly with non-Indian folks, I&#x27;ve found that potential clients always fall into one of two camps -  those willing to fairly compensate based on skills and those expecting to pay less simply because I&#x27;m Indian.
As an Indian, it does sting to see the stereotyping. But defending it by pointing to the success of individuals like Naval Ravikant or Balaji Srinivasan doesn&#x27;t address the root issue (I noticed this pattern on X).
Don&#x27;t let ignorance ruin your day.</span>

                              <span>I agree with you about copyright, but the fact is that the IA never had a chance and we knew it years ago.
The top comment on HN a week after their launch of the EL is critical [0], right at the moment when HN would be most expected to rally to their defense. By the time the lawsuit was actually starting to take shape most commenters had become very concerned for the fate of the IA [1]. This is on a forum that reliably champions freedom of information, but most of us knew even at the time that what they&#x27;d done was extremely unlikely to pass muster.
The IA was never going to be hailed as a cultural hero because they stood no chance, and they are too valuable for other, unrelated reasons to make themselves a martyr. This never should have happened under the same legal entity as the web archive.

If IA had won, IA would be hailed as a cultural hero. They hit and they missed. Claiming Brewster Kahle is against &quot;the people who work very hard to bring new books into being&quot; is unfair. The copyright goalposts have moved so far past where they were originally, the people who work very hard can be dead for decades and their works still in copyright, and by the time they are dead for 70 years, the copyright will probably be extended again.</span>

                              <span>This has been playing out for many years. And it&#x27;s all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive&#x27;s mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.
When IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:
The Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.
https://nwu.org/nwu-denounces-cdl/
When the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.
He also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see https://blog.archive.org/2023/12/15/brewster-kahle-appeal-st...). It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the logical outcome of one man&#x27;s seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.
In addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society. I truly hope the organization can survive.</span>

                              <span>Intel is trapped. Its debt repayments alone are massive. The poor performance in stock has encouraged 20years of wage stagnation to the point where you can literally earn over 50% more at amd or nvidia or even an startup for equivalent roles so they aren’t hiring the best. Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.
They don’t have the talent they need and the debt trap and poor performance means a lot of push back to the needed doubling of wages to attract that talent. It’s a very hard sell for any exec trying to correct this problem. They sidelined lip bu tan who was one of the advocates for even more layoffs and wage freezes but he’s one of many backwards thinkers they need to remove. It’s going to be difficult to fix their board.
Without talent intel has no hope of winning and they can’t get that talent due to poor stock performance for the past 20years leading to executives and shareholders wishing to implement the opposite of what they need right now. In fact they have ongoing layoffs right now. A true downward spiral and the only real hope is for a newcomer to step up.</span>

                              <span>FWIW, I’ve worked at many RedHat shops over the years and I’ve never seen one where disabling SELinux wasn’t a normal part of provisioning a server. I haven’t seen the same thing with AppArmor (although I admit I have less visibility into debian systems administration). YMMV but it seems to me that a component which is so inconvenient that it’s normally disabled doesn’t provide much security in the end.</span>

                              <span>I love my remarkable 2. Bought it before &quot;Connect&quot; was a thing, so I don&#x27;t have a subscription. But I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are better alternatives out there and MyDeepGuide (youtube) has reviewed them all better than I ever could.
The software is moving too slowly and often in a wrong direction. Especially since they released the keyboard folio most updates were around typing (which is supar on any eink device)... and they generally made my experience as a pen user worse.
I don&#x27;t care if the new hardware is awesome, whenever mine breaks I will switch to a competitor.
EDIT: the reviewer I mention is excited about the device https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZkEg8WLeW4Q</span>

                              <span>Millions of Brazilians woke up on August 31 in a country without X, after the Supreme Court ordered the national telecommunications agency to block the social media platform. This move culminated over a year of X&#x27;s refusal to follow Brazil&#x27;s telecommunications laws, particularly those requiring deplatforming of suspects in internet crime investigations. In a single day, X lost 22 million users, while alternative platform Blue Sky gained 2 million new Brazilian users in just three days. The order to ban the platform initially came from Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, a figure vilified by the Bolsonaros and the international far right, and was ratified by a 5-0 vote in the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1st working group three days later.

That is understandable, since Gustave Eiffel’s master piece has been the emblem of the city for a long time. However, the tower is also a symbol of the wealth and power of the bourgeoisie, the “capitalist class”, a patriciate whose exclusive ranks also happen to include the ladies and gentlemen of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). A soupcon of history may help us to understand the centrality the tower in the recent Olympic extravaganza in the “city of light”. More

                              <span>I consider myself an extroverted introvert. Or is it introverted extrovert? More on that later.
I feel like often times, us introverts are misunderstood. A lot of people mistake introverts to be anti-social, or shy… but that’s not always the case. Being an introvert means that our batteries are recharged by spending time alone, away from social interactions. This past weekend, I fully embraced my recharge by spending 3 days in solitude.
I mean… I mostly stayed away from human interaction. At least, I didn’t interact with any humans physically, and only through text with my other half, LC. This is also not because I don’t enjoy the company of others, especially LC’s, but there’s just something rejuvenating about spending time alone. You know… just existing in my own space, without the need to formulate words out loud, because sometimes there are just too many words. Of course, my dog got an earful from me every time I decided I needed to speak out loud.
There was a lot of silence, and little words, this weekend. It was nice not having any obligations outside of my own personal to-do list. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of binge watching (Dexter), which typically take a backseat in all of the life admin stuff I have to do. It was a great opportunity for me to recharge my mental and emotional batteries, and to force myself to find comfort in the quiet and the familiar.
I missed having my other half here, a lot, but it also felt good to take a step back from the world to focus on myself.
So here’s to the long weekend spent solo, the comfort in the quiet, and the understanding that being alone doesn’t have to be lonely.
Side note: I never really felt alone (even when I was) since I have a Velcro dog who literally needs to be attached to me at all times. That kind of balances things out, right?

                              <span>blue period, yamaguchi tsubasa
i finally relented to my mother’s pleas and went with her to avail of a facial treatment plan. the previous one i talked about in an older blog post didn’t work well and left me with even more acne than before. my parents ended up paying a little over the cost of two (2) stray kids vip soundcheck tickets for the philippine leg of their tour1. i’m thankful, really. i don’t think i have the capacity to pay for an 8-week treatment amounting to that much money.
anyways, while waiting for my appointment (the first of 8) i was reading bluets by maggie nelson. it’s an interesting read, albeit slow and maybe even boring at times. i cannot begin to fathom how it’s possible to write so much about a singular colour and relate it to different aspects of your life, but i …</span>

                              <span>The rapid rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to dramatically change the labor market, and indeed possibly even the nature of work itself. However, how firms are adjusting their workforces to accommodate this emerging technology is not yet clear. Our August regional business surveys asked manufacturing and service firms special topical questions about their use of AI, and how it is changing their workforces. Most firms that report expected AI use in the next six months plan to retrain their workforces, with far fewer reporting adjustments to planned headcounts.</span>

                              <span>Economic surveys are very popular these days and for a good reason. They tell us how the folks being surveyed—professional forecasters, households, firm managers—feel about the economy. So, for instance, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) website displays an inflation uncertainty measure that tells us households are more uncertain about inflation than they were pre-COVID, but a bit less than they were a few months ago. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) tells us that forecasters believed last May that there was a lower risk of negative 2024 real GDP growth than there was last February. The question addressed in this post is: Does this information actually have any predictive content? Specifically, I will focus on the SPF and ask: When professional forecasters indicate that their uncertainty about future output or inflation is higher, does that mean that output or inflation is actually becoming more uncertain, in the sense that the SPF will have a harder time predicting these variables?</span>

Instead of putting resources in the root of the web, this is what /.well-known/ was designed for. See RFC 5785:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785
Instead of munging URLs to get alternate formats, this is what content negotiation or rel&#x3D;alternate were designed for.
I’m not sure making it easier to consume content is something that is needed. I think it might be more useful to define script type&#x3D;llm that would expose function calling to LLMs embedded in browsers.</span>

An attacker not only needs your username and password, they also need physical access to your key. They then have to disassemble the device. If they want to give it back to you, they&#x27;ll need to reassemble it.
So not exactly trivial!
A blob of nail-varnish over a plastic seam might be a useful canary.
But this does highlight one weakness of these FIDO tokens - you have to manually maintain a list of where you&#x27;ve registered them. And if your token is lost or stolen, you have to manually revoke every single one.</span>

                              <span>I found this interesting:
&gt; Another option is to put it to beneficial use to create heat or even electricity. The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.
And towards the end
&gt; Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere... But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.
I love reading about landfills. I wish more environmentalists would be excited about engineering solving environmental ills and relied less on knee-jerk reactions.</span>

                              <span>So obviously claiming that there&#x27;s no good reason for process to read argv[0] is either demonstrating the author&#x27;s ignorance or needs a much stronger defense; I&#x27;d be fascinated to hear how they think busybox should work on an OpenWrt box with a 16MB root filesystem.
However, I am willing to consider the discussion about whether there could be merit to restricting the ability to write that value; I could imagine a system that populated it only from the actual file name and did not allow it to be written by the parent process or the child process at runtime. The obvious place this still falls apart is that an attacker could just
    ln /bin/curl ./some\ other\ name

but there are sometimes security measures that we use even though they&#x27;re less than 100% effective so it at least conceivable that this might be a trade off worth making.</span>

                              <span>Scenarios where an IDE with full syntactic understanding is better:
- It&#x27;s your day to day project and you expect to be working in it for a long time.
Scenarios where grepping is more useful:
- Your language has #ifdef or equivalent syntax which does conditional compilation making syntactic tools incomplete.
- You just opened the project for the first time.
- It&#x27;s in a language you don&#x27;t daily drive (you write backend but have to delve in frontend code, it&#x27;s a 3rd party library, it&#x27;s configuration files, random json/xml files or data)
- You&#x27;re editing or searching through documentation.
- You haven&#x27;t even downloaded the project and are checking things out in github (or some similar site for your project).
- You&#x27;re providing remote assistance to someone and you are not at your main development machine.
- You&#x27;re remoting via SSH and have access to code there (say it&#x27;s a python server).
Yes, an IDE will save you time daily driving. But there&#x27;s no reason to sabotage all the other usecases.</span>

                              <span>Grepping for symbols like function names and class names feels so anemic compared to using a tool that has a syntactic understanding of the code. Just &quot;go to definition&quot; and &quot;find usages&quot; alone reduce the need for text search enormously.
For the past decade-plus I have mostly only searched for user facing strings. Those have the advantage of being longer, so are more easily searched.
Honestly, posts like this sound like the author needs to invest some time in learning about better tools for his language. A good IDE  alone will save you so much time.</span>

                              <span>The office I work out of runs an opt-in coffee chat program which
matches you with someone each week to have a short chat over coffee. I
don&#x27;t know anyone in the office, so at the behest of my director I
signed up.
I had my first coffee chat today. The guy I was supposed to meet with
showed up fifteen minutes late, which might have irked me if (i) I
hadn&#x27;t rescheduled our chat something like three times and (ii) if I
actually enjoyed networking. Even though our conversation wasn&#x27;t bad,
all things considered, I still found myself rather grateful when we
had to run to our 4 PM meetings. I always feel phony networking with
other people in the office, especially when they&#x27;re a married
fortysomething busy salesman high up on the org chart who has better
things to do than talk to a lowly peasant…</span>

BearBoost is an Apple shortcut designed to help you boost your blogging.
It&#x27;s for all bloggers, but especially those who use the Bear blogging platform. The idea is to give you a quick and easy tool to help you get writing when you&#x27;re feeling stuck.
It&#x27;s like having your personal muse whisper, &quot;No more writer&#x27;s block! Let&#x27;s turn this blank page into a blog masterpiece!&quot; Okay, maybe not exactly that, but kind of.
The shortcut currently offers nine menu options:
Trending Posts (Bear discovery feed)
Recent Posts (Bear discovery feed)
Ten Topics (pick one and start writing)
Daily Prompt (via Kevin McDonald)
Random Prompt (from Blog Prompts)
Random Quote (from Random Quotations)
Today’s Word (via Merriam-Webster)
Blog Inspiration (a page of mine)
Discover Blogs (the blog directory)
I&#x27;ll likely add more features over time. If you have any requests, please let me know.

                              <span>This day didn&#x27;t start off great. I was supposed to be working in the archipelago, which I love, but someone had forgotten to book a boat for me. I was supposed to be on the island at 8:30 AM, but the mistake meant I would arrive at 11:30 AM instead.
Three hours wasted, and I was supposed to visit six different clients. I could just see myself coming home very late, if I even managed to catch the last ferry back.
Once I got there, it turned out that all the houses were close to each other. The houses were also small, so each visit was short. When I was finished with the last customer, she offered to drive me back to the mainland in her boat.
The day ended with me finishing ridiculously early.
So, why am I telling you this? Because it&#x27;s so incredibly stupid to paint scenarios in advance when we don&#x27;t actually have a clue. We imagine how...
...the workday will be long.
...the job interview will go badly.
...the family dinner will be stressful.
...the date will be awkward.
...the weather will be a disaster.
And then it turns out in the end that those thoughts weren&#x27;t accurate at all. The sun came out and during the job interview, it turned out that we had a mutual friend, so it felt very relaxed and good.
It&#x27;s so much unnecessary time and energy that we spend trying to predict what hasn&#x27;t happened yet. Things we can&#x27;t possibly know in advance.
Of course, it&#x27;s good and even necessary to plan certain things in advance. To do your research and prepare. But it easily gets out of hand or is used when it doesn&#x27;t serve any sensible purpose.
We might tell ourselves that &quot;you want to be prepared for the worst,&quot; but is that really a wise strategy? Isn&#x27;t it better, sometimes, to face the future with an open mind and open arms? That attitude in itself might even increase the chance that it all ends in a surprisingly positive way.
Let’s embrace the unknown and see where it takes us.</span>

                              <span>I am deeply and hopelessly in love and there&#x27;s not much I can do about it. Luckily, the object of my affection is my wife of eleven years. Whenever we are separated, regardless for how long, I unconsciously begin a countdown in my mind until I see her again, even it it&#x27;s just from the beginning of the work day until lunch. I&#x27;ve never known anyone as well as I know her. I can tell her mood from the sound of her footsteps as she descends the stairs from our bedroom into the living room. Neither of us ever attempt to hide an emotion from the other, so intune we are with each other&#x27;s feelings.
My wife is a classic introvert. Our home is her haven, the place where she recharges her batteries. I long ago accepted the responsibility for answering every knock at the door and being the one to deal …</span>

                              <span>The post-COVID years have not been kind to professional forecasters, whether from the private sector or policy institutions: their forecast errors for both output growth and inflation have increased dramatically relative to pre-COVID (see Figure 1 in this paper). In this two-post series we ask: First, are forecasters aware of their own fallibility? That is, when they provide measures of the uncertainty around their forecasts, are such measures on average in line with the size of the prediction errors they make? Second, can forecasters predict uncertain times? That is, does their own assessment of uncertainty change on par with changes in their forecasting ability? As we will see, the answer to both questions sheds light of whether forecasters are rational. And the answer to both questions is “no” for horizons longer than one year but is perhaps surprisingly “yes” for shorter-run forecasts.</span>

                              <span>Rust and Javascript and Lisp all get extra points because they put a keyword in front of every function definition. Searching for “fn doTheThing” or “defun do-the-thing” ensures that you find the actual definition. Meanwhile C lacks any such keyword, so the best you can do is search for the name. That gets you a sea of callers with the declarations and definitions mixed in. Some C coding conventions have you split the definition into two lines, first the return type on a line followed by a second line that starts with the function name. It looks ugly, but at least you can search for “^doTheThing” to find just the definition(s).</span>

                              <span>I suspect it tests your monitor and monitor calibration as much as your color perception. In particular, sRGB displays have a pretty severely limited green gamut. If you have a wide-gamut display, the test is probably gonna appear different.
But another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window, which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we&#x27;re staring at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do &quot;auto white balance&quot; that skews the results. It&#x27;s the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.
To address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller, or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.</span>

                              <span>I think this is flawed. You quickly end up on a color that&#x27;s clearly not &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;green&quot; and you&#x27;re unlikely to keep hitting &quot;this is green&quot; several times in a row, conceding that ok, fine, maybe this is blue, whatever. You&#x27;re basically measuring how many times people are willing to click the same button in a row.
Edit: Possible improvements: changing the wording to &quot;this is MORE green&quot; and &quot;this is MORE blue&quot; and randomizing the order in which they are shown, somehow. I realize you&#x27;re just doing some kind of binary search, narrowing the color range.

                              <span>i dont like getting asked &quot;what have you been up to?&quot;. i don&#x27;t know. i could have had the most interesting past few days, or the most uneventful, and i would simply not remember. my memory is slim these days, and comes to me in fleeting moments when i can form links with events in the present. sitting here in the sun the sun sends me back to the beach i was on this summer. the embrace from a friend brings the scent of the perfume my grandmother used to wear. the unassumed path we bike on takes me to my mom&#x27;s hometown. i wonder at times if i only remember things by association.

i&#x27;ve been doing a lot of things recently, which has been nice. i&#x27;ve been seeing friends and getting out of the house most days. at times i wonder if this is what life is supposed to be all about; these joyful moments shared with others, kept a secret from the rest of the world. i don&#x27;t take many photos when i&#x27;m out like that. my mom gets mad i don&#x27;t have anything to show for my outings. having a photo of the occasion makes me feel like i have cheated myself out of a memory by constraining it to a handful of pixels. who do i need prove i had a good time to?</span>

                              <span>Since I started blogging in January, I&#x27;ve invested time in several different communities, starting with OMG.LOL, followed by Microblog, Scribbles, r/MacApps, r/Obsidian, BearBlog, 500.social and the Blaugust Discord. The most personal of these are the Mastodon community around OMG.LOL, Scribbles and Microblog. The two Reddit communities are the most impersonal. As in any group environment, I have personal interactions with other people and with groups of other people. I also get to watch interactions where I&#x27;m not directly involved because of the way the Internet is structured.
Some of my rules are:
Stay out of other people&#x27;s fights
Never ignore racism, homophobia or misogyny
Never go &quot;Well, actually…&quot;
Give lots of complements
Offer sympathy
Answer questions
Avoid taking sides unless moral…</span>

                              <span>You generally want to minimize the number of passwords you manage; for instance, you should generally be paying the SSO tax and getting as many services as you can onto OIDC. After that, just do the cloud version of 1Password, which is easy to audit and manage access for, which you&#x27;ll thank yourself for when it comes time to SOC2.
Remember, as you give people access to passwords, that those passwords will need to be rotated when those people change to incompatible roles or depart the company. If passwords aren&#x27;t a total pain in the ass for you, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.</span>

An expert told him to hire experts to keep growing it. Now he&#x27;s down to two locations, high in debt and uncertainty.
Corpo bois are not founders, they know nothing of growing a startup. The have never produced value from thin air. They are just good at playing the corpo role. Job security is their main concern.</span>

&gt; You will not be forced to work inside something known as a “virtual environment.”
Oof, this terrible advice cancels out an otherwise reasonable post. Beginners who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing are the last people who should be &#x60;pip install -r requirements.txt&#x60;-ing into the system Python the way this article is recommending. That&#x27;s not only going to make working on multiple projects nearly impossible (especially for the kind of beginning students who get recommended Anaconda, which are almost always the Data Science-y crowd using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit, etc, which are notoriously finicky with version conflicts), but it stands a good chance of breaking other Python-based system utilities in completely opaque ways. This sort of advice can fubar a naive user&#x27;s entire workflow.
I know virtualenvs suck to explain to people, but in my opinion it needs to be done before you ever tell them about &#x60;pip install&#x60;.</span>

                              <span>Key Ideas:
Heavier vehicles are safer for their occupants but more dangerous for others: The weight of a vehicle is a critical factor in car crashes, with heavier vehicles causing more fatalities in other cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.
The heaviest vehicles kill more people than they save: Analysis of crash data shows that for every life saved by the heaviest 1% of SUVs and trucks, more than a dozen lives are lost in other vehicles.
Weight advantages have changed little over time: Despite improvements in safety features, the weight advantage of heavier vehicles has remained relatively constant, with heavier vehicles still causing more fatalities in lighter vehicles.
Carmakers prioritize consumer preferences over safety: Manufacturers are producing increasingly heavier vehicles, driven by consumer demand for larger, more powerful cars, despite the safety risks to others.
Regulators are ill-equipped to address the issue: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s rating system focuses on occupant safety, not the safety of other road users, and tax policies subsidize heavier vehicles.
Public awareness and concern are growing: Surveys show increasing concern about the size and safety of SUVs and pickup trucks, with researchers and policymakers starting to take notice.
Electrification may exacerbate the problem: The shift towards electric vehicles, which tend to be heavier than their internal-combustion equivalents, may increase the weight of vehicles on the road, further amplifying the safety risks.</span>

                              <span>I was once so angry that I reached this current level of understanding English, the level you see right now.
It was in the summer of 2016.
I wasn’t particularly angry at the time, until a certain event occurred. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that significant, but, to put it briefly, the main cause was an English teacher I had at the time. It might have been a childish reason, but I was just a kid back then.
During that summer, fueled by anger, I took the first hardcover English book I could find at home (I remember the title was &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) and tried to read it.
I didn’t have my laptop, internet, TV, or even a paper dictionary at the time. I was furious and struggled to read the book.
On my first read, I understood only about 1-5% of the entire book. But I kept going. As I struggled…</span>

I’ve been complaining about being ill sometimes, about specific symptoms, about being unable to do stuff and being stuck in bed so much.. and the response I seem to get (whether outright or implied) is like “Duh, you are chronically ill, of course this is happening.” Like it’s the most normal thing in the world. As if everyone has already known it for ages and has readily accepted it, but I am lagging behind. “Get with the program already!”

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking about something lately. Something that&#x27;s the complete opposite of how I usually do things — and it feels really good.
It&#x27;s primarily the work on the Bearming theme that made me realize this. Before, I always wanted to have the whole picture clear in my mind beforehand. I tweaked and fiddled, turned it this way and that before finally deciding to release something.
There&#x27;s been this idea that &quot;everything has to be perfect.&quot; This has resulted in spending a huge amount of time before pressing the publish button. There are several problems with such an approach...
For one thing, there is no external feedback whatsoever when I&#x27;m sitting and tinkering behind closed doors. It becomes a limited creation process with a very narrow perspective. A one-man show for something that&#x27;s intended for an audience.
Another problem with creating &quot;for my eyes only&quot; is that the public announcement will never get a response that matches the time spent on the project. It leads to a feeling of scarcity, that it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ve spent all this time, and this is all I get?
The new approach for me of creating publicly feels incredibly liberating and refreshing. I first released a beta of the theme and have since refined it and added new things along the way. Having a changelog also reinforces the feeling of continuity and development on a creatively rewarding level.
I&#x27;m going to try to implement the same mindset with my entire blog. Revisiting old posts, reviewing the content, maybe adding tags or an image, and so on. A never-ending project without timeframes.
Bits and pieces that slowly, one step at a time, make for a more detailed and interesting picture – that&#x27;s the kind of digital painting I want to keep creating.</span>

Osa, a 13-year-old lab/pit mix had a swollen stomach and was moving around very gingerly. Her condition had not changed by this morning and he elected to take he to the emergency vet&#x27;s office in his neighborhood. The two of them were not gone long when he returned, grim faced. &quot;She&#x27;s dying&quot; he told me.
Osa survived the removal of stomach tumors three years ago. Now they have returned and in such profusion and size that removing them at her age isn&#x27;t a practical option. my granddaughte,r who lives in Virginia had an October trip already planned to come home for a visit with Osa, the family dog since she was in kindergarten.

Servers are holding up so far! Fortunately we were overprovisioned. If we hit 4mm new signups then things should get interesting. We did have some degradations (user handles entering an invalid state, event-stream crashed a couple times, algo crashed a couple times, image servers hit bad latencies) but we managed to avoid a full outage.
We use an event-sourcing model which is: K/V database for primary storage (actually sqlite), into a golang event stream, then into scylladb for computed views. Various separate services for search, algorithms, and images. Hybrid on-prem &amp; cloud. There are ~20 of the k/v servers, 1 event-stream, 2 scylla clusters (I believe).
The event-stream crash would cause the application to stop making progress on ingesting events, but we still got the writes, so you&#x27;d see eg likes failing to increment the counter but then magically taking effect 60 seconds later. Since the scylla cluster and the KV stores stayed online, we avoided a full outage.</span>

                              <span>The step-up in cost basis on death is the original sin that underpins the entire debate over unrealized gains.
It&#x27;s disheartening to see so much thought and deliberation going into an obviously toxic idea (taxing unrealized gains) when the obvious solution (removing the cost basis step-up when assets change hands) is being ignored.
Inherited wealth is the least earned, so it should be politically palatable to change this. But presumably because such a change would acutely affect the people who make laws in the country specifically, it is never seriously considered.</span>

                              <span>I worked for about a year with a consulting firm that handled &quot;Y2K compliance&quot;. Unlike this Andersen exercise in legal face-saving, it was a real job. Big companies hired us to do a full inventory of their site equipment (this included manufacturing plants, Pharma stuff) and go line by line with their vendors and figure out which components had known Y2K issues, which had not been tested at all, and which ones were fine/had simple fixes. We helped them replace and fix what needed to be fixed.
Y2K was a real problem. The end-of-the-world blackouts + planes falling from the sky was sensationalism, but there were real issues and most of them got fixed. Not trying to take away from this very interesting story of corrupt cronyism, but there were serious people dealing with serious problems out there. &quot;Remember Y2K? Nothing happened!&quot; is a super toxic lesson to take away from a rare success where people came together and fixed something instead of firefighting disasters.</span>

But I did not know about the technicalities (wtf is RSS?) and the culture of blogging. And although it took some time to set this whole endeavor up2, it is the culture-thing that is the hardest for me.
I am used to Twitter and Bluesky, where posts have to be short and draw attention. This combination rewards posts that say divisive shit3 and punishes those that are nuanced and complex. It is easier to wish death onto some asshole politician than to explain what they did wrong. If you want to write something personal or sincere you have to meme and/or bury it under ironic detachment.

                              <span>TL;DR: Bearblog doesn&#x27;t (currently) strip location data from your uploads, so you need to do it yourself
UPDATE: Herman just added a comment in the nolt suggestion that locations are now removed, and there is a corresponding commit.
A new uploaded photo shows that EXIF metadata (including location) is now removed:

Thanks Herman for the fast work! 💨
I noticed that bear blog posts with pictures were loading rather slowly - turns out images are being stored and served as-is, full-sized and all.
This is probably a Good Thing(tm) for people running photo blogs, but I also realised that photo metadata, including your location, are being retained - not something you would want, e.g. if your pictures were taken at home.

                              <span>Earlier today I was reading some new posts by Visa. There’s not much to say about that, except that he uses pretty normal words and writes very well.
This might seem like an odd comment, but it stems from my reading of another post, A Brief Case on Bearblog. The author of that post is clearly a talented and experienced writer who, it must be said, writes very (very) well. However, the words they use are so fancy, and the way they’re woven is so perfect that reading them feels ?strange?1.
This thought reminded me of an excellent essay by Paul Graham, Write Like You Talk. In it, he argues that if you want people to connect with you, you must write in a way that feels familiar to them. Essentially, the essay rests on the assumption that we all speak similarly but think differently.
