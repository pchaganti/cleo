Declaration at the trial (October 30 2013) for the wounding of Ansaldo Nucleare managing director Roberto Adinolfi
 ‘Nobody can judge me 
 Not even you 
 The truth hurts you, I know.’ 
 C. Caselli 
 A few words to make a few simple points before the ‘truth’ is pronounced by the court; just in case it’s not clear, I am using the word ‘truth’ ironically as I don’t recognize any tribunal other than my own conscience. The only ones responsible for what happened in Genoa on May 7 2012 are Alfredo and myself. None of our friends or comrades knew what we were planning and then carried out. No matter how far you dig into our lives and…</span>

 “The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.” 
 - The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin 
 We in the Libertarian Socialist Caucus (LSC) of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) recognize that our formation has dual obligations, both to the development of the socialist movement in the United States and to the broader libertarian socialist movement that exists outside of DSA. While much of our caucus’ focus thus far has been on DSA’s internal politics, we believe in cross-pollination with the broader libertarian left via an …</span>

I have switched to posting my Week Notes to Saturdays, although it will encompass Saturday-Friday of my week (this sounds somewhat awkward but I have yet to find a flow that makes sense).
This week has been hard, as is the trend for the past few months. Learning to wrap my head (and heart) around some of the things happening within my ecosystem.
The new coffee table we bought came in early. It was much easier to put together than the TV stand that took us hours. The coffee table is 100lbs+ since it’s made with marble, and by far the heaviest coffee table I’ve ever owned.
I randomly entered Porkbun’s 2 million Domains Giveaway earlier last week, and got notified that I was one of the winners. I love free shirts! (And just free things in general).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a pretty busy day today and didn&#x27;t have much time to plan for a post, so I thought I&#x27;d just give a small summary of interesting things that happened today.
1. Celebrated my mother&#x27;s birthday
Today my brothers and I celebrated my mom&#x27;s birthday. We took her out to dinner at a steak house and went to watch the new Deadpool movie afterwards. My dad even bought her a bouquet of flowers as he is overseas at the moment, she really seemed to enjoy that.
2. I almost lost over a thousand dollars
I woke up this morning to a huge number of unauthorised charges on my card, I immediately tried to freeze or cancel my card but because my bank&#x27;s system was under maintenance, I had to sit in anxiety and hope no new charges came in until the system was back up. I managed to cancel my card and get a new one issued but I still have to dispute any pending transactions to get my money back.
3. 4000 Japanese words learnt
I finally hit the milestone of learning 4000 Japanese words, according to my Anki stats. Super happy that I&#x27;ve kept up this habit of learning Japanese everyday for almost 200 days straight.

                              <span>&quot;We are all different&quot; – a phrase thrown around quite often. And thankfully, it&#x27;s true. Some adore winter, others summer; some thrive in nature, while others prefer the city.
But there&#x27;s one area where this diversity seems absent: socializing.
The first to leave a party is branded a bore. Anyone declining a gathering is deemed a weirdo. Going to the movies alone marks you as strange.
Why is this? Why does socializing always trump solitude? It&#x27;s as if loneliness is automatically equated with something being wrong.
There&#x27;s a lot of talk about the importance of online privacy, but when it comes to wanting some privacy in the physical world, it&#x27;s a different story. We&#x27;re expected to be &quot;online&quot; by default, 24/7. If we go &quot;offline,&quot; it&#x27;s treated as a malfunction — a 404 page.
People often tell me I&#x27;m a social person. Sure, I enjoy listening to others, asking questions, and reflecting on their experiences in light of my own. But it comes with a price...
After two or three hours, I&#x27;m exhausted. I experience a &quot;social hangover.&quot; Everyone seems to be talking endlessly about nothing, as if there&#x27;s a collective fear of silence and stillness.
Why is solitude taboo?
I don&#x27;t have the answers, but I&#x27;ve gotten better at announcing my early departure. It still feels odd to do so, and occasionally, I&#x27;m met with confusion. But honestly, I don&#x27;t care — I&#x27;m too old for that, and it feels incredibly liberating.

                              <span>This is interesting, but I have to quibble with this:
&gt; If you express this value in any other units, the magic immediately disappears. So, this is no coincidence
Ordinarily, this would be extremely indicative of a coincidence. If you’re looking for a heuristic for non-coincidences, “sticks around when you change units” is the one you want. This is just an unusual case where that heuristic fails.</span>

                              <span>Was shocked to hear this news. I worked for Google years ago but I was in the NYC office, so we didn&#x27;t run into the YouTube folks much.
Opinions about YouTube may be mixed here on HN, but it is objectively one of the most successful businesses in tech or media to emerge in the past 15 years. If it weren&#x27;t buried inside Alphabet, Youtube would be worth on the order of $400 billion, more than Disney and Comcast combined. It&#x27;s a weird mix of a huge creator monetization network, a music channel, an education platform, a forever-store of niche content, and a utility.
It&#x27;s also not a business that rested on it&#x27;s laurels. It&#x27;s easy to forget how novel creator monetization was when YouTube adopted it. They do a lot of active work to manage their creators, and now have grown into a music and podcast platform that is challenging Apple. To top it off, YouTube TV, despite costing just as much as cable, is objectively a good product.
Few products have the brand, the reach, monetization, and the endurance that YouTube has had within Google. And I know for a fact that this is in no small part due to the way it was managed.
I&#x27;ve probably watched tens of thousands of hours of YouTube at this point. Some of it sublime, some of it absurd, some of it critical for my work or my degree. I couldn&#x27;t imagine a world without it.

Edit: some people misinterpreted my comment. I&#x27;m just one anonymous  voice on the Internet, but am deeply saddened by the passing of Susan Wojcicki, who meant a lot to me as one of the many people who crossed paths with her professionally. I wish her family strength in a very trying moment. She did not deserve this. I&#x27;ve not met another business leader demonstrate everyday kindness to the degree that she did.
Her untimely passing is also a reminder to those of us who sometimes look up to such successful businesspeople that we should all appreciate our luck to be alive and enjoy it to the fullest, as I hope that she did as well, and as I&#x27;m sure that she&#x27;d prefer we did. RIP</span>

                              <span>The before/after ECU layout diagram is very instructional.
I like to imagine some kind of engineering “meet cute” whereby, one random day, the headlights engineer and the parking radar engineer happen to be working on the front of the car together.  Their eyes meet:
“hey, I’m John — I didn’t know you had an ECU here!”,
“hi, I’m Claire — wow, you have an ECU right up front too?  It’s, like, right next to mine and we never knew!”
“I know, crazy right?!  Hey this is going to sound really forward and I don’t normally do this but I’m only running at 70% compute capacity.  I don’t suppose you need any real-time budget this evening?”
“So funny you should ask, I was just about to run a whole bunch of heavy new wiring to…”
And in a story as old as time they get ECU married and raise their control loops in the same front-of-vehicle ECU together instead of living their separate, lonely, ECU-right-next-to-each-other-and-they-didn’t-know-it lives.</span>

If your load fits entirely on one server, then just run the database on that damn server and forget about “special architectures to reduce round-trips to your database”. If your data fits entirely in RAM, then use a ramdisk for the database if you want, and replicate it to permanent storage with standard tools. Now that’s actually simple.</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
This is Bess, Jake&#x27;s wife. I just want to say how deeply touched I am to see how much Jake and his writing are appreciated here on HN. The intellectual online community which made up a big piece of his life for so long was important to him, as was having a positive influence on others, and it would have meant so much to him- as it does to me- to see the impact he made. Thank you for the people who reached out while he was still alive to make sure he knew just how large that impact was.
I&#x27;ve lost the love of my life, as well as my thinking and writing partner, and everything is strange and disorienting right now. It&#x27;s a comfort when nothing feels comfortable to know how appreciated he was and still is. As soon as I&#x27;m able, and for anyone who is interested in joining the efforts, I promised him I&#x27;d continue the push for FDA reform, and to try to find ways to improve agency for cancer patients so that other people in his position might suffer less than he did. I&#x27;ve never known a braver person. I&#x27;ll miss him forever, but won&#x27;t stop trying to keep his legacy alive.
Please feel free to reach out anytime (I&#x27;m at drbstillman@gmail.com). Thank you also for all the well wishes for myself and Athena, who I hope will be just like her Dad.</span>

                              <span>My biggest frustration with .internal is that it requires a private certificate authority. Lots of organizations struggle to fully set up trust for the private CA on all internal systems. When you add BYOD or contractor systems, it&#x27;s a mess.
Using a publicly valid domain offers a number of benefits, like being able to use a free public CA like Lets Encrypt. Every machine will trust your internal certificates out of the box, so there is minimal toil.
Last year I built getlocalcert [1] as a free way to automate this approach. It allows you to register a subdomain, publish TXT records for ACME DNS certificate validation, and use your own internal DNS server for all private use.

He blogged at https://jakeseliger.com/&gt;, and numerous of his blog articles were submitted to HN:  https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site&#x3D;jakeseliger.com&gt;.  That includes numerous topics, over the past year or so his experience with cancer, often concerning frustrations with the process and mechanism.
His essay on agenticness especially strikes me as hugely insightful and underappreciated.  It was submitted several times to HN but saw little discussion:

Jake&#x27;s wife, now widow, Bess, blogs at Everything is an Emergency:  https://bessstillman.substack.com&gt;.  That also details the cancer / caregiving experience, from the point of view of a wife, caregiver, expectant mother, and emergency-room doctor.</span>

You know what? I do. We all should. These scammers are awful people and deserve to be attacked. I am tired of toothless authorities like CISA and the alphabet agencies in the US doing next to nothing about it unless some YouTube scam baiter does the work for them. Scammers destroy people, not just financially, but emotionally as well, even driving some victims to suicide. As far as I am concerned,  any wannabe hacker out there should be using these scammers for target practice.</span>

                              <span>In this episode of CounterPunch Radio, Rebecca Maria Goldschmidt talks with fellow members of California Jewish Artists for Palestine Sophia Sobko and Steph Kudisch, about their collective decision to submit and withdraw explicitly anti-Zionist artworks to an open call for Jewish artists at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. They discuss the process of pulling their works out of the exhibition; the importance of the academic and cultural boycott of Israel (PACBI); and what it means to be Jewish artists publicly confronting Jewish arts institutions that receive Zionist funding and are struggling to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.
Steph Kudisch is a trans genderfluid artist whose work uses mutated intertidal aesthetics and personal storytelling to dwell in in-betweens. They work as a teaching artist on Lisjan Ohlone land, also known as the San Francisco Bay Area. Kudisch and their collaborator Kate Laster form Clear as Schmutz Press as well as the collective Hevra Kadisha in which they create site-specific works across the mediums of printmaking, sculpture, performance, and sound.
Sophia Sobko (she/they) is an artist, educator &amp; researcher born in Moscow, USSR &amp; based on Lisjan Ohlone Land in Oakland, CA. They are excited about collaborative learning, participatory art, and co-creating a more liberatory world. Sophia is founder/co-steward of two queer post-Soviet Jewish collectives: Kolektiv Goluboy Vagon and Krivoy Kolektiv.

Oxfam, a global charity, reported that 2022’s 10 richest men together had six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth. More

Directly behind the clinic is a larger building bearing the sign “Attleboro Women’s Health Center.” This second facility advertises free ultrasounds, free pregnancy testing, and “pregnancy counseling.” Their website features the term “abortion” so many times that it’s  More

I&#x27;m in no way a web designer, but i am curious about how folks get certain features to work on BearBlog, so I&#x27;ve done some reading and experimenting. Someone asked me to share what I&#x27;ve learned and I am always willing to do that.

Under Settings&gt;Header and Footer Directives &gt; Header, I have some code copied from the website SearchMySite that allows my blog to be searchable in their IndyWeb search engine. It&#x27;s not visible when you are looking at one of my blog posts.

                              <span>I’ve been seeing a lot of Reply posts, or just posts in general with bloggers playing off of each other’s blog posts and think it’s absolutely fantastic.
During my Wordpress days, I took for granted the automatic pingbacks (is that still a thing?) when my post gets mentioned somewhere, and I know that Webmentions exist, but now I’m doing things a little bit more manual.
Earlier last month, around the time I posted To Blogroll, or to not?, I added a section at the bottom of my posts (when it applies) titled 💬 COMMUNITY ECHOES. In this section, I add posts I run across that is either a response to that post, or references the post in some way.
Some examples from my recent posts where you can see this section:
Video Games I&#x27;ve Owned and Played
The Plan to Not Have a Plan
When Every Day Feels the Same
Adding references to other posts that have been written on similar subjects allows readers to click through to see other people’s takes on that specific subject. I know that I personally enjoy reading other people’s blogs, and then finding a link to another blog that talks about the same thing, especially if it’s the same subject with a different (or same) perspective. It’s also (selfishly) nice for me to keep track of posts that mention mine for my own personal documentation.
I welcome you all to go down the rabbit hole of posts with me.
Also, if there is a blog post of yours where mine is referenced that I missed, feel free to let me know, so that I can add it.
Happy reading!

                              <span>The Indie Web is a great place. Ever since I started writing on this website, I&#x27;ve received the most heartwarming reactions—from plain old emails to guestbook comments, and in some cases, even reply posts that can spark discussions in what might otherwise feel like posting into the void.
A reply post like this was RE: Why Are Shoes Treated Differently Than Shirts by Marisabel, which really made me think about stuff I wrote in my original post. I loved that! She mentioned me on Mastodon, and I thanked her for the reply, it really made my day back then.
Last week, I discovered another reply through the analytics page of my bear blog, which had a referrer I wasn’t familiar with—mgx. I visited the website and found a reply post to my bat incident! It had a short poem about it, which made me laugh and brightened my day, especially since I was feeling quite sick after the vaccine.
I wanted to thank mgx for the reply, but I couldn’t find a way to contact on the website. Obviously, not everyone wants to be approachable, and I understand that, but I still wanted to acknowledge the reply—so here we are!</span>

                              <span>I believe consistent Bearblogging has made me a better writer, but not in the way you might think. I don&#x27;t mean it has drastically perked my English grammar or refined my sentence structure (though these have definitely been a bonus). Instead, it makes me write more, and, subjectively, that is my definition of a good writer: someone who writes.
Before Bearblog, I had a penchant for perfectionism with writing, which made me avoid it for years. For my first blogpost, I was rusty from the lack of practice, and I faced difficulty expressing my internal chaos of thoughts &amp; ideas into coherent phrasing. I was practically forcing out words. That paid off, though, because regular Bearblogging has made my words come more naturally now. I easily phrase whatever crosses my mind, writing as I go along…</span>

                              <span>I think what’s going on behind the verbal sleight of hand here, is focusing on the process (quest) instead of the outcome (goal). It’s the difference between doing a thing and having done a thing. I might enjoy having written a book, but I don’t think I would enjoy writing a book. And I don’t think calling it a quest instead of a goal would make much difference</span>

You can talk all day long about how early startups just don&#x27;t need the kind of management benefits that Kubernetes offers, but the article isn&#x27;t written by someone working for a startup, it&#x27;s written by a company that nearly got sold to Adobe for $20 billion.
Y&#x27;all really don&#x27;t think a company like Figma stands to benefit from the flexibility that Kubernetes offers?</span>

                              <span>IME what works best getting new projects kick started is hiring a very small team of senior freelancers, making one of them lead, and letting them loose. I worked on such a team once and it was really excellent. The advantage of this strategy is if the experiment doesn&#x27;t work out, terminating freelancers is much easier than permanent (I noted you&#x27;re based in Europe).
Contrary to what other people said, I wouldn&#x27;t try find a CTO straightaway. It&#x27;s a hard role to hire for, especially at the start. I think you&#x27;re better off unleashing a small, excellent team of builders then hire management later to help build out the team if the initial effort succeeds.
Happy to chat more about my experiences with this strategy, davedx@gmail.com (I&#x27;m in Europe too)</span>

                              <span>I used to be a tree-style-tabs power user but at some point I went back to regular tabs. I find that the amount of horizontal tab space is pretty close to the actual number of things I can usefully have open at once. Seeing the tabs get &quot;squished&quot; is my reminder to close the ones I no longer need.
I was using the tab-state as a sort of short-term working memory and I don&#x27;t think it was doing me any favours, particularly in terms of focus.
Now when I&#x27;m working on a project, I keep a list of relevant URLs in a text file (i.e. bookmarks but checked into source control).
I also use two browser windows, a regular one for &quot;stateful&quot; browsing, and a private-mode one for &quot;stateless&quot; browsing. Quick queries and exploratory research happens in the &quot;stateless&quot; session, with the understanding that I can close any of these tabs (or nuke the whole session) at any time without losing anything important. If I do come across something important, it gets noted down elsewhere.</span>

                              <span>I would argue the opposite. They are not aiming to be a neutral arbiter but an active advocate for better repairability. For that they should have for-profit business relationships with basically all companies manufacturing such devices. In particular, that would allow them to pressure or drop any one misbehaving company.
&gt; Providing consumers with information on where to find reputable companies selling repair parts would be a much more palatable alternative to selling them yourself.
That does not really make sense. They are a repair company and the only company selling specialized parts is, of course, the manufacturer.
&gt; also stands in the way of advocating for consumers.
That is much too bleak. They made a deal happen in the first place, which is large progress even if it did not quite work out, and compromises are a fact of life.</span>

                              <span>I think many might not be aware of Starliner&#x27;s sordid history. It has failed essentially every qualification test in various ways. Their pad abort test (where you simulate a launch abort while on the launch pad) resulted in only 2 of the 3 parachutes deploying in beyond optimal conditions. NASA considered that such a resounding success that they let them completely skip the far more challenging in-flight abort test. Their first automated mission to the ISS completely failed and did not make it to the station. NASA finally required a redo from Boeing and their second one did make it to the ISS, but only after experiencing widespread leaks and thruster failures literally identical to the ones that have now left these astronauts stranded.
If SpaceX or another company had remotely similar results, they would never have been greenlit. For instance in spite of a flawless pad abort test, NASA required SpaceX also carry out an in-flight abort. And that&#x27;s completely reasonable - you don&#x27;t simply skip tests, even with optimal performance. Skipping tests following suboptimal performance is simply unjustifiable. And so I think we&#x27;re largely looking at another Challenger type disaster caused by a disconnect between management (and likely political appointees) versus engineering staff, rather than inherent risk. But this is not a vessel that should have ever had a single human anywhere near it, and so their official comments (and even actions) on the situation are going to be heavily biased due to their own behaviors.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, I read a post by Bearly Significant titled: &quot;Headlines Terrify Me&quot;. The post talked about the nuances of creating the perfect headline, that one time they made a typo, and their fear of sabotaging themselves with their words.
The post starts:
Crafting an effective headline is an art form mastered only by the finest journalists and editors. In fewer words than a tweet, all nuances and &quot;yes, buts&quot; must be simplified. This is crucial because journalists are taught to always consider: &quot;if someone only reads the headline, will they be somewhat informed?&quot;
Although the blog post was geared more towards the news sector, I can’t help but think that there is some parallelism with how bloggers craft their blog post titles.
I think everyone has their own flavor of titling their posts that works with their niche, and blogging voice. I follow a few who title their blog posts…
In a super vague way that makes you want to click on the post to understand what their title means
Short and straight to the point - you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into and the topic of the post
A poetic title that encompasses the topic of the post
A few words excerpt from their actual post
…and so on.
I think I do a mixture of some of the above. I tend to lean towards a blog title that evokes the same emotion as what I’m writing about. If it’s a more poetic piece, I title it as such. If it’s more casual, the title also tends to be. Although there are times when my posts tend to be vague, the goal is to rarely make the title vague. I always want you to know what you’re getting into so you can choose to read, or pass on my posts. I hate clickbait, and so I try to avoid that as much as I can.
My blog is pretty straight forward. What you see is typically what you get.

                              <span>Hello fellow blogger,
I found your blog and the &quot;Finding my Blogging Voice&quot; post through Bear&#x27;s &#x27;Most Recent&#x27; feed and felt like writing a reply.
It&#x27;s wonderful to see that you got your first post out there. A good and interesting one too, that many bloggers can relate to. Now that you&#x27;re up and running, the hardest part is over.
I&#x27;ve been in a similar situation myself and understand how you feel. My advice is to not overthink it and just keep writing and posting, writing and posting, writing and posting...
I always find myself thinking I could do better, write better, be better.
We can all do better, and the only way to achieve it is by consistently publishing content. Plus, what we consider our &quot;best writing&quot; today, will be replaced by &quot;even better&quot; soon. Looking back at what I thought was my &quot;best writing ever&quot; five years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t even publish it today.
Besides, we&#x27;re terrible at being our own critics. We&#x27;ll post texts we believe are outstanding, only to see them go by unnoticed. And we&#x27;ll post texts we hesitate to share, which end up being our most read ever.
Blogging is like a school without final exams, that’s what makes it so valuable and rewarding.
Just keep on blogging and never skip class.
Good luck!

The original post by &quot;Thoughtless Ramblings&quot; made ripples in cyberspace. Another great example of the beauty of blogging. A first post was all it took...

I had a hard time finding my voice. I always felt like I needed to perform for someone with my writing. Took me a while to feel comfortable just writing for myself and to get stuff out of my head. And I think the way I see it now is like I&#x27;m doing an impromptu presentation and some people might stop and listen. — Juan Villela</span>

                              <span>Mikasacus recently made a video titled &quot;how to actually love yourself&quot;1 in which he details his own journey towards discovering self-love:
I learned that self-love means giving yourself acceptance for your very being, accepting your flaws, quirks, and failures as a part of you and choosing to respect yourself despite your perceived shortcomings. It means treating yourself with the same respect you would treat anyone else with. You wouldn&#x27;t tell someone something even half as cruel as the things you tell yourself. So why would you tell yourself those things?
His overall message comes down to self-love being something not about vanity but about developing a deep sense of self-assurance, acceptance, and trust with yourself. True self-love involves treating oneself with kindness, respect, and …</span>

 Reports suggested that Blue Carbon—a company privately owned by Sheikh Ahmed al-Maktoum, a member of Dubai&#x27;s ruling family—had signed deals—a land grab enacted in the name of climate change mitigation. In response, Blue Carbon insisted the discussions were merely exploratory and would require (...)

                              <span>I&#x27;m very skeptical on this, the paper they linked is not convincing. It says that GPT-4 is correct at predicting the experiment outcome direction 69% of the time versus 66% of the time for human forecasters. But this is a silly benchmark because people are not trusting human forecasters in the first place, that&#x27;s the whole purpose for why the experiment is run. Knowing that GPT-4 is slightly better at predicting experiments than some human guessing doesn&#x27;t make it a useful substitute for the actual experiment.</span>

                              <span>I listened to the whole conference and here&#x27;s my impression:
1. NASA manager Steve Stich said there&#x27;s a relatively wide &quot;band of uncertainty&quot; in how risky a Starliner return is. Some (many?) NASA engineers are at the high end of the band and are advocating a return on Dragon instead. Boeing is obviously at the low end of the band and thinks it is a low risk.
The problem is, the data doesn&#x27;t rule out either side of the band. So they are trying to get more data to narrow the uncertainty (in either or both directions). [Interestingly enough, the data from the White Sands testing made them more worried because it revealed the Teflon seal deformation.]
But my sense is that if they don&#x27;t narrow the uncertainty (i.e., convince the NASA engineers) then they will very likely choose a Dragon return.…</span>

                              <span>I’ve built quite a few french drains in residential settings, some lasting longer than others - I’ll share a few hard earned lessons here:
Soil migration is the number one failure mode. This is mentioned but perhaps a bit understated in the video.
To prevent soil migration you absolutely need commercial grade geotextile fabric wrapping the gravel and pipe.
You can buy pipe with much bigger and more numerous holes than the tiny slits depicted in the video. That also obviates the need to decide what orientation the holes should be.
Void space is the most critical factor when choosing gravel. You need a lot of space between the rocks to support fast drainage. Do not use playground pebbles or anything similar. Pay close attention to the type of aggregate you’re buying.
Calculate how much water you actually need to drain. You can use the “100 year flood” values for your locale to get an upper bound on rainfall, then multiple by drainage area. This is especially important if your roof is part of the watershed.
https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/sci...
Sometimes there is insufficient gradient to move the water anywhere, ie the land is too flat. In this case you may be better off building a drywell, which is constructed very similarly.

                              <span>There are many ways I come up with blog post topics to publish. Most days, I sit down in front of my computer (or phone) and allow myself to just type, see what comes out, and then refine. Other times, I write intentional posts about topics that I have been ruminating on. Then there are moments when my emotions run so strong that I have to express them before I explode. I guess such was the case yesterday.
Of course, there are other ways. I have a list of topics I want to get to one day, but those have been mostly ignored. They overwhelm me too much.
Anyways, that&#x27;s not the intention of this post.
The best topics come to me in the most inopportune times, and so half the time, they never see the light of day. I often find myself coming up with things I want to write about in that space betw…</span>

                              <span>Has labor demand changed since the COVID-19 pandemic? In this post, we leverage detailed data on the universe of U.S. online job listings to study the dynamics of labor demand pre- and post-COVID. We find that there has been a significant shift in listings out of the central cities and into the “fringe” portion of large metro areas, smaller metro areas, and rural areas. We also find a substantial decline in job listings in computer and mathematical and business and financial operations occupations, and a corresponding increase in job openings in sales, office and administrative support, food preparation, and especially healthcare occupations. These patterns (by geography and by occupation) are interconnected: the biggest declines in job listings by occupation occurred in the largest and densest geographies, and the strongest increases in job listings by occupation occurred in the smaller and less populated geographies.</span>

                              <span>We recently talked with Federico Bongiovanni (Google) and David
Eads (Red Hat), Chairs of SIG API Machinery, to know a bit more about
this Kubernetes Special Interest Group.
Introductions
Frederico (FSM): Hello, and thank your for your time. To start with, could you tell us about
yourselves and how you got involved in Kubernetes?
David: I started working on
OpenShift (the Red Hat
distribution of Kubernetes) in the fall of 2014 and got involved pretty quickly in API Machinery. My
first PRs were fixing kube-apiserver error messages and from there I branched out to kubectl
(kubeconfigs are my fault!), auth (RBAC and *Review APIs are ports
from OpenShift), apps (workqueues and sharedinformers for example). Don’t tell the others,
but API Machinery is still my favorite :)

                              <span>Just in response to your second point, I do think that&#x27;s specific to you and your circles. I know multiple retired or semi-retired people who have moved towards the center of a city. Without work to keep them occupied, they want the hustle and bustle, which means something to do. And driving has become more of a hassle and a barrier to the kinds of lives they want to live. These are east coast or midwest cities, so maybe there is something about SF that&#x27;s different, but that&#x27;s my experience.</span>

                              <span>This pitch worked much better in the 80s and 90s when
A) most investors had a broker not just for advice, but because there was no easy way to trade individually or get live stock quotes until the internet was widespread and matured
B) telephone sales in general were more common then and less likely to be a scam (Stratton Oakmont and other boiler rooms played a large role in shifting public opinion on this)
C) The most desirable prospects (High Net Worth Individuals) were accustomed to dealing with legitimate brokers over the phone and being solicited by brokers from other legitimate firms in such a way
D) The markets were raging in such a way that everyone had FOMO and was dying to hear of a hot new tip
Almost nobody legitimate in the financial advising world acquires customers via cold call pitching anymore. Cold calling is still part of the toolkit for other sales niches (eg, tech sales) but it&#x27;s a tough road with a low success rate.</span>

                              <span>There is a famous paper about the location of company headquarters: they get as close as possible to the residence of company CEOs. If we don&#x27;t consider the CEO&#x27;s influence, I&#x27;m actually curious if the location of company headquarters has to do with the average age of the employees in the Bay Area. As the employees start to have families, they most likely move to the south bay for better or for worse, and I have a hard time imagine that they&#x27;d enjoy commuting via BART or Caltrain for more than an hour every day. And this is probably just me or my circles, a city&#x27;s hustle and bustle becomes a distraction or at least increasing irrelevant as I age. I increasingly enjoy ample parking space, tranquil suburbs, being able to step out and start jogging in woods or huge parks, and certainly not having to deal with the craziness on SF streets. If more people are like me who prefers living outside of the city proper, then I&#x27;d imagine a company will have access to more talent by moving its headquarters to the south of SF.</span>

Maybe they will have better luck in Santa Clara.
I don’t buy any of the flamebait reasons for leaving SF. Reason 1 is money and reason 2 is talent pool.</span>

                              <span>Good job releasing your project! It&#x27;s a cool idea and surprisingly minimalist. That said, I&#x27;ve found a number of cryptographic flaws in the application source. This should not be used in instances where the encryption is mission-critical.
1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it&#x27;s far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.
2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.
3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.
4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (&quot;#&quot;) which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it&#x27;s important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the &quot;#&quot;. If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).

I realize this story is a cluster of divisive topics but that&#x27;s why HN&#x27;s guidelines say &quot;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.&quot;

                              <span>I want to blog but have never posted. I start a draft and work on it for hours and days, but I never think it&#x27;s good enough. I always think that I could do better, write better, be better. For so long all I&#x27;ve written is essays and official memos, I find it hard to let down my standards and be natural.
My recent resume is working against me; four years of college with essays and lab reports, and a year at a corporate job with professional communications. Writing off the cuff to a casual audience doesn&#x27;t come as easy to me as it once did. Somehow I need to undo the last five years of training and relearn simplicity and sincerity.
This is my first post and I don&#x27;t expect it to make a splash, but rather just a drop in the sea of writers online. My real goal with this post and others are to find my &quot;blogging voice&quot;, a version of myself who can write freely without worrying so much about the particulars.
I&#x27;m afraid this post will join the myriad others on BearBlog in the &quot;meta-blogging&quot; category; blogging about blogging. While that may be true for this first entry, I&#x27;m hoping to expand my writing in the coming months, I just hope someone will join me on that journey.</span>

                              <span>One of the houses I visited at work today had an absolutely stunning view of the sea. I could have easily stayed there all day.
When I mentioned how amazing the location was, the owner of the house replied, &quot;Yeah, but you don&#x27;t think about it after a while.&quot;
It should be illegal to live like that if you don&#x27;t even appreciate it, I thought as I walked back to my car. I started driving away and caught myself...
But what about me? I&#x27;m basically the same.
I don&#x27;t live in a house with a sea view, but I have an apartment with a window overlooking a beautiful courtyard. And every morning when I walk to my car, I pass amazing old buildings.
How often do I think about it? Hardly ever.
Yet, it&#x27;s something I once marveled at for its beauty. Where did that awareness go? I looked out the window now and it still looks absolutely wonderful, of course.
Okay, it&#x27;s never going to be like &quot;the first high&quot; again, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. Just a tenth of the first experience is still immensely precious and rewarding.
A tiny bit of awareness is all it takes to start observing and appreciating our surroundings. Let&#x27;s remind ourselves of the beauty of the mundane.</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been feeling upset and frustrated about some of the things happening in my life. I’m screaming into the unknown because I’m not really sure what else to do. The right words have been hard to come by, probably because I’m not really sure what I’m legally allowed to say, and not say. I know I’m not the only one.
Talking to people in the same space as me is a challenge in itself. There is a very small circle of people that I trust, but those numbers are dwindling down even more. There are a few that I’d love to open up to, but with the environment we’re in, I’m really not too sure who to trust. With everything that’s happening, I’m not sure whether or not to be grateful about where and how I currently stand.
I have this nagging feeling that the worst is yet to come for me. I don’t know if this is just me overthinking or irrationally being a pessimist. All I know is that my mental health keeps going downhill, even when I think I’m nearing the bottom. My physical health isn’t doing any better. The more stressed I am, the worst my immune system gets.
Every day, I’m faced with another challenge, another thing actively blocking that light at the end of the tunnel. I’m trying to convince myself that I just need to persevere through this and everything will be OK, but at the same time, I think it may be time to try to actively dig my way out of it.
I just need to figure out how.

I was having a phone call with my best friend last night. I know he&#x27;s going through a really tough time and has been for a while. I felt anxious and stressed about whether or not I could be a good friend / what he needed. I knew that things between us are great and will be, and all I needed to do was be there to listen and support him.
So why would I be stressed? Zooming out a bit, I&#x27;ve always been shy, never really let anyone into my thoughts and feelings, and frequently deny any help offered to me. It&#x27;s always been hard for me to get close to even my best friends. I really abused the shit out of &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t need your help&quot;.

This modest increase reflects a substantial slowdown in mortgage origination; only $374 billion was originated during the second quarter, compared to an average of about $1 trillion per quarter between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, after nearly thirteen years of decline, balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) have begun to rebound, gaining 20 percent since bottoming out at the end of 2021. In this post, we consider the factors behind this upswing, finding that HELOCs have likely become an attractive alternative to cash-out refinancings amid higher interest rates.</span>

Only a small minority of politically active individuals are participating in the protests on the streets. Those are mainly Islamic activists. This can be understood in two ways: That Hamas, which is leading Gaza strip, is th…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been into running a blog or personal site very long, it&#x27;s safe to say you&#x27;ve heard the terms &quot;IndieWeb&quot; or &quot;small web&quot; thrown around. I&#x27;ve only been into this stuff for a few months at this point but my understanding of what that actually means has already matured and evolved a lot.
Really, any personal website you use (instead of corporate social media) for your online presence is part of the IndieWeb. It&#x27;s like independent music. You&#x27;re writing, recording and distributing all on your own rather than finding a manager, record label, big name recording studio and getting wrapped up in contracts.
It&#x27;s pretty punk, actually. Running your own corner of the internet is like recording an album in your bedroom and then selling it at the shows you independently worked with bars and venu…</span>

                              <span>Long after I&#x27;d finished creating the theme for this blog, I still thought the design was spot on (and still do). It&#x27;s the ideal theme in my opinion.
Recently, I asked my brother for his thoughts. He replied: &quot;It looks like the site is broken. There are no images or anything. It&#x27;s so incredibly boring!&quot;
I&#x27;d never seen it that way, but I understand his point... haha. It&#x27;s true what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When it comes to the look of this blog, I think more people agree with him than me.
Anyway, that, combined with Lou&#x27;s post Website Fiddling, has inspired me to start working on a new design. It&#x27;s always exciting and inspiring to try something different.
I plan to use Bear&#x27;s official theme as a starting point and customize it here and there. I&#x27;m also considering some larger changes as separate &#x27;add-ons&#x27;.
If I finish it, anyone is welcome to use it. I&#x27;m not a professional designer (and have a full-time job), so Bear with me — it might take a while...or never get finished.</span>

 Anarchy, from the Greek a or an (not) and arche (the first, the chief) or archon (a magistrate) means that state of society in which there is no government. It is, therefore, very improperly applied to that state in which there are two, or more, governments contending for the supremacy. What Anarchists desire, is the permanent abolition of all government. It is contended, and is doubtless true, that this would…</span>

 Anarchism, it can hardly be necessary to say, is not a conspiracy for the assassination of kings and such-like. It is not an armed movement of the proletariat or of a part of them. It is not a secret organization. Notions of its nature such as people of information have abandoned to journalists, journalists to politicians, and politicians to Mr. Roosevelt, require no further refutation. Anarchism, whatever it may give rise to, can be described as a theory only. The thesis of Anarchism is that men govern men by deceiving them — a view never very unfamiliar to statesmen like Machiavelli, but which evidently assumes a somewhat novel complexion when preached to the people who are g…</span>

Preamble
 The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. 
 There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. 
 Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth. 
 We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the evergrowing power of the employing class…</span>

These applications aim to recreate traditional financial instruments and services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance. The DeFi intermediation chain connects a series of intermediaries who find arbitrage opportunities, aggregate transactions into blocks, validate these blocks, and ultimately append them to the blockchain. In this post, we summarize results from our staff report describing how arbitrage opportunities arise in the Ethereum blockchain, and how the need to keep these arbitrage opportunities private gives rise to the intermediation chain.</span>
