Various approaches have been employed, utilizing firm-level emissions data, financial market data (from equity and derivatives markets), or textual data. Focusing on the latter approach, we conduct descriptive analyses of six text-based climate risk indices from published or well-cited papers. In this blog post, we highlight the differences and commonalities across these indices.</span>

                              <span>Since discovering my favorite types of blog posts are essay-like in anatomy and length, I&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of time to both writing and reading such posts. Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I&#x27;ll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I&#x27;ll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I&#x27;ve really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don&#x27;t always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.
When I post something in the morning, I&#x27;ll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don&#x27;t have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it&#x27;s a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I&#x27;ve also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me. I feel really good after blogging, and I don&#x27;t ever want that to change.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

                              <span>With the world at war, the feeling that the international system has failed humanity is increasing. The challenges posed to international law and the United Nations are structural—a minority of violent, militarized governments dictate the terms and play by their own rules.

I detest email spam and have been looking into tried &amp; true solutions for obfuscating email addresses. Contact forms are great for hiding email addresses, but I don&#x27;t love relying on yet another service for something so simple as email.
It turns out a simple CSS &quot;display: none&quot; blocks 100% of spam! I&#x27;ll be using this method to list my email address moving forward — you can see how it looks on my About page.
The symbol substitution method seems to still be effective, but I want my email address to be easy to copy-paste.
Here are the HTML and CSS snippets for anyone interested in hiding their email address from spam bots.
HTML for email address
Add this to where you want your email to display. Update username and domain.com with your actual information.
username@mail.domain.com

Theme CSS
span.email b {

Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven&#x27;t liked, your posts?
Say hello to the &quot;unlikely&quot; button. It works like the standard button but doesn&#x27;t display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post&#x27;s popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: &quot;☆ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: &quot;Like it?&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: &quot;★ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: &quot;Thank you!&quot;;
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}

                              <span>🗓️ // September 28 - October 4, 2024
I didn’t feel quite like myself this week.
A month ago, we bought pre-sale tickets to Treasure Fest’s last event (Halloween themed) of the summer for last weekend. Since LC and I were still recovering from our sickness, we decided to just skip out on it. Thankfully we made it to at least one in this summer.
Being sick, and even while recovering, puts me in a mood. This week was especially hard on my mental health. It was pretty difficult to keep my head up.
I pushed myself to go to work even when my health wasn’t 100% yet. I facilitated and was an active participant of a lot of meetings. I had to warn my co-workers that if I stop speaking randomly and go on mute, it was due to my coughing attacks.
We took Cocoa to the vet for a check-up. She’s been inc…</span>

Title: Black and Red Rags
Date: 3 Oct 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/black-red-rags/

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…</span>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day. 
 Şehîd Tekoşer will always remind us of the fallen comrades,
 the beauty of struggle and the price of the defense of freedom.
 With our grief, we celebrate Lorenzo’s life …</span>

Title: Communizing Society With Consumer Cooperatives
Date: September 28th, 2024
Source: https://c4ss.org/content/59900

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…</span>

                              <span>Since Robert Birming released his Timeline design, I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and including it in some of my pages.
But I was also curious on how I could include it to make a microblog out of a typical Bearblog. Not that you can&#x27;t make short posts on here in a default look, but most of the design of Bearblog and its themes is decidedly for longform content. I wanted something that looks more like a microblogging/short post platform.
&#x3D;&#x3D;Some goals I had in mind for my own microblog:&#x3D;&#x3D;
I didn&#x27;t want these low effort posts to be in the Discovery section; make_discoverable has to be false in the Post preset.
The posts need to mention when they were made; I need to include {{ post_published_date }} in the h4 of the Timeline code.

                              <span>When I was a child, I grew up in a hoarder home. My mother had me at 16. We lived with my grandmother and her then wife, who kept everything she ever received. I have vivid memories of two things in that house.
The first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.
 

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lived in neighborhoods with a Homeowners Association1 all my life. There were times I found having one to be advantageous, but these days it&#x27;s just plain annoying.
The house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

Tumblr e-girl intrigue, the notoriety of public celebrity, the psy-slop of attention hacking economics and industrial scale mediocrity is tearing down the aura, prestige and myth of Islamicate civilization in cyber. The latent iconoclastic potential of Islamicate art has been squandered and instead we have meatspace media empires, fools who have tried to make gold off the back of other fools. In the process we have a contagion of functional illiteracy, cultural apocalypse and no real vibrancy. The Muhammadan spirit is missing from Dawah Inc. There is no real transgression, when Dawah Inc positions itself as a menu item that also includes Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson.

                              <span>Carmel by the Sea is such a cute little town—super quaint and dog-friendly! We spent the day here for my birthday back in August.
Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

I was feeling rather cooped up earlier so I went out for a walk. Smack in the pouring rain. Thankfully, my sneakers were worn and in need of replacing so getting them soaked wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal; still, one is forced to ask oneself if they&#x27;re capable of making good life decisions when the wind starts howling against your umbrella. By the time I got to the halfway point of my walk, lightning was flashing furiously. Like I said, not a good life decision.
Almost every store was closed today. The only things left running were big corporate: convenience stores and chain cafes. I stopped by a Louisa (Taiwan&#x27;s Starbucks equivalent) and saw that there was only the barista inside.

                              <span>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.

                              <span>Back in 1991 my co-blogger here at Crooked Timber, Elizabeth S. Anderson, reminded every one of the significance of John Stuart Mill and Experiments in Living (Ethics, 102(1): 4-26).

The survival of the PRC is now longer than the Soviet Union, which lasted 74 years. China has nearly one-fifth of the world&#x27;s population and on some measures is the largest economy in the world, although per person national income is only 30% of that of the US.

                              <span>Recent events have heightened awareness of systemic risk stemming from nonbank financial sectors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.</span>
