                              <span>I get it: in order to induce the declining, cognitively crippled Joe Biden to admit that he’s a catastrophic loser bringing down his party and greatly increasing the likelihood of full Republi-fascist takeover in 2025, Democrats have had to kiss the president’s ass. The only way to get Bernie Sanders’ “good friend” “Genocide Joe” Biden to give up his delegates and allow them to go to someone with (perhaps) a better shot at beating Adolph Trump (the man Trump’s 2024 vice presidential running mate JD Vance called “America’s Hitler” in 2016) was to praise the incumbent as “a man of great integrity with a long and noble record of service to America and humanity including his heroic defeat of Trump in the 2020 election.” More

                              <span>In the mid-1990s, I was a professor of international relations at the National War College and a member of the Brookings Institution’s Russian Study Group that held regular off-the-record discussions of key issues.  This was an important time when the leading subject for the study group was the question of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The group had rather high level membership from the National Security Council, the Departments of State and Defense, and the intelligence community, particularly CIA and INR, the intelligence arm of State.  These individuals were for the most part supporters of the absurd idea that we had won the Cold War and there was a mood of triumphalism and exceptionalism that was obvious in their support for NATO expansion.

                              <span>Billionaires have tried very hard to buy influence and political power. For example, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg donated $20 milliontoward efforts to reelect Biden this year alone. Four years ago, Bloomberg spent a whopping $1 billion in just four months in an attempt to be the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. In a testament to the fact that we have a modicum of democratic accountability left within the system as it stands, he failed spectacularly, as others have often done. Voters seem to have a distaste for electing the ultra-rich but have yet to disavow the de facto proxies that their money helps elect. More

                              <span>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to address a joint session of Congress on July 24. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson took the lead in extending the invitation last March.  With the participation of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it soon became a bipartisan invitation. This won&#x27;t be the first time an Israeli leader has used an address to Congress to strengthen Israel&#x27;s already powerful relations with America.  In 2015 Netanyahu bypassed the White House to deliver an address that attacked U.S participation in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations.  Although the Prime Minister&#x27;s visit deeply embarrassed then President Obama, a year later he overlooked the slight to commit $38 billion in arms aid to Israel over ten-years.    More

I&#x27;m back in my own apartment after being in the country again for the last few days. It&#x27;s nice to be around my own things and have some time to write some personal email letters, read blogs, journal, and be alone for a bit.
ideas/thoughts/reading:
-Working on a zine: Summer Diaries. This will be a short edition of maybe 20 copies. Tiny snippets about my country jaunts (written on my typewriter) with Polaroid pictures of said jaunts. Each copy will receive a different Polaroid from the zine. This project is born from wanting a more physical existence, a continuation of my quest for solid/analog experiences. A tangible proof of ordinary days.

                              <span>Back in early 2016 I had a medical emergency I never saw coming and had something happen to me that resulted in my having to take early retirement. Though I am thankful it wasn&#x27;t permanent retirement to the grave.
The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can&#x27;t say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…</span>

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It&#x27;s citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers&#x27; losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).
Similarly, CMU students are driven not by dreams of passion o…</span>

                              <span>NATO’s Washington Declaration contains a section that is puzzling. It says that China “has become a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine.” The term “decisive enabler” has attracted significant attention within China, where the government immediately condemned NATO’s characterization of the war in Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that NATO’s statement “is ill-motivated and makes no sense.” Shortly after Russian troops entered Ukraine, China’s Wang Wenbin of the Foreign Ministry said that “all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and upheld.” This is precisely the opposite of cheerleading for the war.

The failure of Israel’s two most important allies, the US and UK, to put an end to the slaughter of the civilian population in Gaza in 2023-2024 and the American and British mainstream media’s refusal to contextualize the 7 October attack raises questions about their status as democratic states. What many independent journalists and academics have described as Israel’s genocidal policy in Gaza has a parallel in America’s “Indian removal” policies in the 19th century and British colonialism in India, where violent imperial rule brought about tens of millions of excess deaths between 1880 and 1920 (Sullivan &amp; Hickel, 2022). The racist underpinnings of settler colonialism have thus been present in Western, specifically Judeo-Christian, political culture since Europeans first explored continents beyond their own. Modern day Zionism is a retrograde form of colonialism and imperialism that is rooted in 19th-century nationalist, militarist, capital-expansionist, and racist practices and outlooks of Western Europe from which it sprung.

                              <span>I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It&#x27;s a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.
Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let&#x27;s call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There&#x27;s more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it&#x27;s completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.

                              <span>I got my commuter card in the mail this week from work, and today I used it for the first time! I was so excited about it I even texted my friend. It&#x27;s a silly thing to be excited about, considering that it&#x27;s literally just a Visa prepaid debit card with my own money on it, the only benefit being I&#x27;m not taxed for money put on that debit card. But it still makes me happy, for reasons besides the few hundred dollars it&#x27;ll save me in taxes that I cannot explain. (Maybe it makes me feel like the Responsible Independent Adult in the city that I always wanted to be.)
Back in college my friends and I would do things like leave amusement parks early to grocery shop and make healthy dinners together back at home. We&#x27;re turning into our parents, we&#x27;d say, laughing, the irony of a bunch of teenagers…</span>

J&#x27;espère que parmi celles et ceux qui le liront,
il y aura quand même 2-3 &quot;pélo&quot; qui arriveront à s&#x27;identifier à mon ressenti.
Ces dernières années, j&#x27;ai mené de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle.
Mais j&#x27;ai souvent été déçu.
Elles n&#x27;avaient pourtant pas de problèmes intrinsèques.
J&#x27;entends par là qu&#x27;a priori, je crois que les joueurs s&#x27;amusaient.
Je pense d&#x27;ailleurs que je m&#x27;amusais aussi durant la partie.
Bien sûr, tout n&#x27;était pas mémorable, tout ne se valait pas,
il y a eu des bonnes et des mauvaises rencontres,
mais j&#x27;estime que ces parties n&#x27;étaient pas &quot;mauvaises&quot;.
La déception dont je parle est plus personnelle.
Et elle va plus loin que la partie en tant que telle.
Pour comprendre cela, il faut se pencher sur la r…</span>

The International Court of Justice has made definitive what has been obvious for decades: It’s about the apartheid, stupid. In a sweeping ruling announced on Friday at the Hague, the Court ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories violates international law and should be ended. It determined that the occupation amounts to “annexation” of Palestinian lands and that all Israeli settlements should be evacuated and the land returned to Palestinians. It said that all Palestinians who had been forced into exile should be granted the right to return and that Israel must pay them reparations for its destructive actions. The court described Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories as a form of racial segregation and apartheid and called for the dismantling of the apartheid wall, checkpoints and other barriers to travel.

You NEED a Framework and there is no way around it!
Without one, you will remain stagnant at best!
You see, I finally figured out my health and fitness after many years. Over the years, I have jumped from one fad to the next, trying keto, intermittent fasting, low fat, high fat, you name it!
Additionally, I have found myself committing to a workout program for a few weeks only to switch it up on myself and try something else that seemed more exciting in the moment. Because of this constant change, very little progress was being made. In fact, I was simply maintaining at best!
Finally, I made a change to my way of thinking!

But as with any growing community, this hasn&#x27;t been without its own set of challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorised into 2 groups:
1. Spam blogs
Fighting spam is an ongoing battle, but mostly a solved problem. A combination of The Frustration Loop and the review process has taken care of it. However, due to a sharp increase in the number of signups recently (both legitimate and spam blogs), I&#x27;ve co-opted the help of Pam and Shraddha from Bonsai Digital to get through the never-ending stack of new blogs.

                              <span>Trump&#x27;s would-be assassin, Crooks didn’t seem overtly political. His politics were the politics of the gun. He searched for the names of Biden and Trump, equally, it seemed and was likely to have pulled the trigger on the first one who entered the sights of his AR-15. There was just a dime’s worth of difference between them as far as he was concerned. Crooks is the next variation on Kyle Rittenhouse, a fucked up white kid, working a dead-end job in a shabbily run nursing home, who ventured forth bound for glory with a semi-automatic rifle in the Republic of the Shooter.

This article outlines some planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.31 release that the release team feels you should be aware of for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment.
The information listed below is based on the current status of the v1.31 release.
It may change before the actual release date.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features.
This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level.
A deprecated API has been marked for remo…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, I wrote a blog post titled “To Blogroll, or to not?” With my thought process of not adding a Blogroll to my page, but opting to add a Postroll instead. Since that post went live, I have gotten replies from both ends of the spectrum agreeing and (respectfully) disagreeing with my thought process. I’ve highlighted some of those responses at the bottom of the post under the 💬 Community Echoes, if you were curious.
Anyways, this got me really thinking about Discovery and Community, especially since I’m seeing a few articles written ranging from “WTF Happened to Blogs” to “indie blogs are doing OK: here’s how to find them”. I wanted a way to contribute to the blogging community, which has made me feel immensely welcomed since I rejoined at the end of March.

                              <span>u know that feeling when it&#x27;s nearly impossible to achieve something..
either because you&#x27;re too late
or you didn&#x27;t prepare enough and it has high competition
your mind and logic says: there is no way
but your brain (or soul?) says: f*ck it we do it anyway.
and somehow (most of the time) it works out!
and even if it doesn&#x27;t -- u don&#x27;t feel thaaat bad..
u say gg and move on.
that leap of faith is real!
i hope such happy ending occurs again in my upcoming move inshallah.
if u reading this: wish me luck homie -- will need it fr.</span>

                              <span>this is the first time i&#x27;m revealing my age on bear, something i kept hidden for privacy&#x27;s sake. 

i&#x27;m quitting my part-time job next week. 

is it okay to be unemployed at 26? 

i think it&#x27;s mainly because i don&#x27;t like where i am right now. 

when i was a kid i picked up on things very quickly. 

i know (i hope) i won&#x27;t be stuck here forever. 

i&#x27;m still struggling, and even if i tell myself and others that there is no such thing as being behind, i can&#x27;t help but feel dissatisfied with my current situation. 

i&#x27;m trying to have faith in myself but i&#x27;m not so good on my own, so please put your faith in me as well. 
and hope with me that this too shall pass.</span>

-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don&#x27;t read them. I&#x27;m a collector of nightstand-books.
-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I&#x27;m in love.
-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.
-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you&#x27;re shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you&#x27;re wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.
-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).
-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don&#x27;t know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.</span>

I&#x27;ve read your post a life lived diligently, and it made me want to write to you.
When I was younger, I dreamed every day of becoming a product designer. I had convinced myself I was going to go study abroad, become self-employed, and the riches and fame would be mine.
poor, depressed artist aesthetic, after which I would be discovered and prove everyone wrong about not chasing your dreams. My peers would see me on TV and gawk. Grand finale: let the curtain fall; everyone applauds.
I&#x27;m happy to say none of that came true.
The truth is, your 20s are a little bit of a bitch. These are the years someone can either be going steady with a child on each hip or they can be partying &#x27;til the sun goes down. Comparison is hard to keep at bay since everyone is going at a different pace and …</span>

                              <span>Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.</span>

Introduction
TO BEGIN...
 “We recognize that the feminist camp has made great efforts, by revealing the mechanisms that oppress women and dissidence, and by naming issues that used to be invisible. However, this does not mean that the concepts and categories, and therefore the theoretical frameworks, are all equally valid. As especifist anarchists we task ourselves with taking from these theoretical productions, the concepts and categories that are consistent with our own ideology.

Her short dry tresses peeped forth from under her faded bonnet, her pretty hand in her torn glove readjusted them from time to time; her swelling bosom, covered by a rug, was full of the breath of health; her quick black eyes glanced at one moment out of the window at the scurrying fields, at another stared boldly at her mistress, or glanced uneasily at the corners of the carriage.
