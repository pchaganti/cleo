Title: The left of capital is sabotaging the anarchist movement: let’s fight back!

 Soon after the escalation of the war in Ukraine, two completely different tendencies began to emerge under the banner of anarchy. One tendency insists that all inter-state wars are wars of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, and therefore our participation in them cannot benefit the interests of the exploited class. The other tendency focuses on material, ideological and propaganda work in support of Ukraine’s state war effort and it sees such an approach as a pragmatic step for future self-organization.

I don&#x27;t know... Lately, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about my fear of failure (or maybe I&#x27;ve already failed?), seriously.
I&#x27;m a very hardworking person... I have courses from prestigious universities (currently over 95 courses), I know four languages and am fluent in three, and I have certifications that many people would love to have, but every day I feel like I&#x27;m failing more.

                              <span>On my way home from work, I realized that something must have happened. The closer I got to home, the later the arrival time showed on the map app. It turned out to be a serious traffic accident involving a truck.
An hour later, after I had parked my car and started to walk home, the sky immediately opened up. It came down like the rainy season in Asia, causing everyone to run for cover.
In a way, it was a nice little break. A moment of reflection. I started to think about the changes in life...
How quickly a moment can change completely. Well, I was lucky to be hit by rain and not a car, but it could have been me in one of those vehicles.
As I finished the last job of the day, I decided to wait to go home to prepare for tomorrow&#x27;s job. Who knows, maybe those minutes were life-changing for me. I will never know.
It doesn&#x27;t hurt to remind ourselves from time to time of the changes in life, its fragility and unpredictability. Not in a resigned way, but in gratitude for what we have.</span>

                              <span>Quiet Sunday (6/16) stroll in downtown Richmond this past weekend.
I&#x27;ve always loved the vintage aesthetic, but have been more drawn to it recently. Been loving this little area in the MOM &amp; POP art shop in downtown Point Richmond (CA). We&#x27;ve gotten a few pins and a record (or 2) here in the past.
Here are some of my favorite snapshots...





And then some more finds around the area...
In case you didn&#x27;t know, I have a thing for photographing old school pay phones.


I also really happen to love typewriters.

A photo series is never complete without a quick snap of Cocoa.</span>

                              <span>Juneteenth is named after June 19, 1865, when news of their emancipation reached enslaved people in Texas. None of the pundits who are commenting on the holiday ask why enslaved people were in Texas in the first place.  General Antonio López de Santa Anna, who fought Texas enslavers at the Alamo in 1836, is depicted in settler school books as a villain. No. Santa Anna was opposed to slavery. He found the practice disgusting. The defenders of the Alamo, some of whom ran away, were pro-slavery. More

 In issue 215 of Black Flag we ran a critique of the politics of Green Anarchist, “Irrationalism — Steve Booth Against the Machine”, which attacked propositions by Steve Booth (in Green Anarchist 51) in favour of “acts of intense violence against the system with no obvious motives, no pattern”. Booth stated that:

Title: My Own Pearl Harbor
Date: Dec 7, 2022
Source: medium.com/@danielmcgowannyc

 December 7, 2005 was my own personal Pearl Harbor: the moment that defines the ‘before’ and ‘after’. The morning started out normal enough. I had plans to stuff some holiday cards for my job and then stop off at a sporting goods store to pick up a gift for my brother-in-law. After that, I was going to babysit for my sister, which I really looked forward to. 
 After some mundane hours in the office, I looked up for a second and a few men were in the doorway of my cube. “Daniel McGowan?,” they said and before I knew it, I was standing, spun around onto the desk and being cuffed. “You’re going back to Oregon” is the phrase that sent me spinning. And like that, the past had caught up with…</span>

 The award-winning documentary, If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front, premiered at Sundance last spring and continues to screen in theaters across the globe. The film, which aired on PBS earlier this fall and is now available on DVD, details the events that led to the imprisonment of environmental activist Daniel McGowan and raises critical questions about ecological crisis, terrorism, and government repression of political activists.

 Having failed last year to show its much heralded “anti-terror” raids against anarchists in 2020 were justified, the State last week lost a second bid to silence their main target, Toby Shone. 
 The cops’ attempt at targeted repression, using anti-mafia laws against someone unlucky enough to have had drugs in his home during the raids, is just the most recent attack against European anarchists however. It’s part of a broader pattern which has emerged as energy for the moral panic over fundamentalist Islam subsides.

1. PRELIMINARY NOTES
 The Houthis attacks on cargo ships, the USA/UK strikes against Yemen, the USA/EU naval fleet deployed in the Red Sea, the ISIS-K Crocus City Hall attack[1], the Iran/Israel missile attacks[2] constitute new expressions of the emerging global reality: competing groups/blocks of capitalists have chosen the route of war, in order to establish themselves in a better position within the hierarchies of a globalised economy that is in stagnation, and is also dealing with the exhausti…</span>

Ashanti: First thing, first thing, first thing... Power to the people. 
Audience: silence
Ashanti: Oh! Wait a minute... First thing, first thing, first thing... Power to the people. 
Audience: Power to the people! 
Ashanti: Oh my God, I&#x27;m like, whoa... And what we usually say when someone says power to the people, the response is; all power to the people! Alright, so I give you the first one. Yeah, I mean, that&#x27;s OK, &#x27;cause I was practiced, right? 
 But all power means that all power goes to the people, right? Didn&#x27;t say to the party. Didn&#x27;t say to the state. It didn&#x27;t say to the slick talkers. Not other ones. To the people, to the pe…</span>

Nos piden desde el principio un régimen perfecto, garantía de que las cosas se harán así y no de este otro modo, sin coscorrones, sin tanteos. Si hubiéramos de aprender a vivirlo, no terminaríamos nunca el aprendizaje. Ni el niño aprendería a andar, ni el chico montaría en bicicleta, ni sería posible adquirir un oficio o una especialización. Al contrario, en la vida se hacen al revés las cosas.

Title: On Eugene O’Neill’s “Philosophical Anarchism”
Date: 2007
Source: The Eugene O’Neill Review, Vol. 29 (2007), pp. 50–72. 

 Some reasonably well-known facts circulate in O’Neill scholarship regarding the subject of this essay—the playwright’s relation to the American anarchist movement in the opening decades of the twentieth century. We know, for example, that as early as 1903, when O’Neill was fifteen years old, a minor anarchist cohort calling itself L’Avvenire (“the Future” or “the Oncoming”) existed in New London, Connecticut, the closest thing O’Neill could claim as a hometown, and published the radical newsletter II Nostro Programma (“Our Program” or “Our Agenda”). We also know that the Greenwich Village bohemian Lo…</span>

                              <span>Visited a new cafe. A very cozy place. The aroma made it impossible to resist getting something good to go with the coffee.
The walls were decorated with plants and art. One of the pictures caught my eye. It said:
Always be a little kinder than necessary.
Wise words! And so simple. A free gesture that can brighten someone&#x27;s day.
A little smile. A thumbs up. A &quot;tell the chef the food was delicious&quot;.
We don&#x27;t need to exaggerate. We don&#x27;t have to lie. And we should not suppress any dissatisfaction.
But we can actively choose to put kindness first. We can face the world with an open hand instead of a clenched fist.
If we had to pick one or the other, then the positive attitude wins every day of the week.

                              <span>In our previous post, we documented the significant growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) over the past decade, but also argued for and showed evidence of NBFIs’ dependence on banks for funding and liquidity support. In this post, we explain that the observed growth of NBFIs reflects banks optimally changing their business models in response to factors such as regulation, rather than banks stepping away from lending and risky activities and being substituted by NBFIs. The enduring bank-NBFI nexus is best understood as an ever-evolving transformation of risks that were hitherto with banks but are now being repackaged between banks and NBFIs.</span>

I tell them I’m still trying to get my head around it, that I feel like a fish out of water, that this isn’t my world … but I’m starting to see the outlines of an insight that the lesson of the day is that innocence must be upheld as a political principle. I still can’t put it into words. They ask me again. They’re curious. This is something new, my something new, their something new (they never had a friend who’s an MP). More

Edison built the first commercial electricity-generating power station in New York in 1882, while Insull designed how to monetize the juice from an ever-growing supply. Add in the ability today to buy and sell to others along an internet-enabled, “bi-directional” grid, however, and we could soon be embarking on the next big thing or an unregulated free-for-all with everyday customers holding the bag.

Title: On Organization
Date: 1954
Notes: Translated from the Italian-language article in ‘L’Adunata dei Refrattari’, June 19, 1954, New York City and Newark. A partial English translation previously appeared in ‘Resistance: An Anarchist Bi-Monthly‘, August-October 1954, New York City, but this is a new and complete translation

 The Livorno conference, which took place on the first two days of May, has again shown that the comrades of Italy are still searching for the anarchist organization that will take on the task of harmonizing and strengthening their work, and, just as with their first meeting almost nine years ago, they are still far from the realization…</span>

Title: The Armed Nation
Date: 1902
Notes: Translated by Andrea Asali, from “‘La nazione armata,’” La Rivoluzione Sociale (London), no. 4 (November 15, 1902), published in ‘The Complete Works of Malatesta, Vol. V, The Armed Strike: The Long London Exile of 1900–13′ (2023), edited by Davide Turcato, who notes that &quot;In the debate on how the army should be structured, a debate that has accompanied the history of unified Italy, the &#x27;armed nation&#x27; was the model that federalist and democratic forces opposed to that of the permanent army at the sovereign’s service. Under this model, military education was to be extended to all citizens and, instead of spending a long period of time in the barracks, training was given starting from school and then through short-term exercis…</span>

                              <span>“You look tired today.”
It wasn’t meant to be offensive, just an observation from a co-worker whom I respect, when we got on a video call today. The truth is, I’m exhausted. I’m typically really good at hiding how I’m feeling on camera, but not today. Today, my face shows an inkling of how I’m really feeling inside: Emotionally drained.
For the most part, you never really know what people are going through because some people just don’t show it outwardly. We automatically assume that a smile, or a positive demeanor means that things are going well, but that’s not always true. Behind that smile, or the “I’m doing fine” after an automatic how’s it going? as a greeting from someone, there might be a hurricane of emotions, anxieties and challenges that are being battled silently.
We live in a world where vulnerability is often hidden by a brave face, and it’s so easy to forget that everyone has their own battles they&#x27;re working through. A seemingly perfect life on social media, or a blog post, can be really deceptive. It’s more important now than ever, being in a mostly remote world, to practice kindness and empathy, as you never really know what someone is going through.
And so, that’s me. As a leader in my world of work, I try not to let my personal life interfere with how I lead my team, and yet sometimes it just can’t be helped. I’ve just been having a difficult time compartmentalizing some things, and I am trying to get better at it.
You see, another aunt of mine passed away on Friday, and I haven’t even processed saying goodbye to my other one before that. I’ve been faced with 4 deaths in 4 weeks in my life, and it’s just a little bit too much right now.
Be kind. Be gentle.

Surviving a loved one’s death can only be personal and subjective. We all react differently, we all perceive differently, we all emote differently.

There are many excellent blogging platforms available nowadays. The concept of &quot;better&quot; is not especially relevant. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences and requirements.

 War is the health of the State. It automatically sets in motion throughout society those irresistible forces for uniformity, for passionate cooperation with the Government in coercing into obedience the minority groups and individuals which lack the larger herd sense. The machinery of government sets and enforces the drastic penalties. The minorities are either intimidated into silence, or brought slowly around by subtle process of persuasion which may seem to them really to be converting them. Of course, the ideal of perfect loyalty, perfect uniformity is never really attained. […] (I)n …</span>

 What makes you think you can govern me? 
 When my mind is about to explode and fling 
 Shrapnel in every direction and into the void 
 For this soul of mine is weeping, while yours gently 
 Blow sleeping in the gaze of protective eyes. 
 Barrage the barricades of your world ‘til they tumble 
 Crumble onto the doorstep of our anarchist utopia? 
 A ticking fission or fusion bomb around the nuclear family - 
 I cannot wait until it disintegrates into ash 
 It never did anything to me - Blood 
 Lines only weave together pain - Choose 
 Your own kind over the abstract confines 
 Of a triple helix with the extra back 
 Bone of suffering. 
 The bigotry ebbs and flows through our collective 
 Memories that we perhaps should forget but cannot 
 Unsee through flashbacks of those who harmed - 
 Us, through bricks at glass and break the institution 
 That hates us - that seeks to eradicate us 
 Yas I may be extreme but was that ever a bad thing - 
 I’ll just shine with the light of a trillion photons 
 Exploding and releasing the energy 
 Of my ungovernable queer self.</span>

 Dear Society, 
 Telling me the way to go - never fit myself into your gender 
 Confines and even in my disruption their compulsion to fit 
 Me into a box flickers behind… shadows. The flames 
 Burning my mind, or am I burning. Fuck. Their stereotypes. 
 You cannot speak up about anything. Be passionate. 
 Rant about ableism and transphobia and they give strange looks 
 And yeah girls can do that, but I’m not one of them… 
 And my identity of being loud… is this just internalized misogyny…? 
 Head and a broken body, too wrong, but I feel no connection to the physical 
 Right…? 
 I guess that’s a lie. Cannot be stoic. Only a fragment.
