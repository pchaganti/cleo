                              <span>I have always loved reading, even as a child. I remember reading under the covers until 2am, way past lights out and my bedtime. I would go to the library after school and put my name down on the waiting list for newly released books. I&#x27;d (im)patiently wait for my turn.
But for some reason, I never appreciated the books we were assigned to read in school. I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s due to the selection of books, or just the fact that I was required to read it (I’m not great at being told what to do). Either way, I would read the books I wanted, and read cliff notes (are cliff notes still a thing today?) of those that I didn&#x27;t read for school.
Needless to say, I completely regret showing a lack of appreciation for the classic books. To make up for it, I am attempting to build up a collection of books I admire that I should&#x27;ve appreciated a long time ago. The goal is to get the covers I remember from back in the day, instead of the more modernized version.
Yesterday’s thrift finds:
Bridge to Terabithia
A Wrinkle in Time
The Great Gatsby
The Metamorphoses
It joins my (still small) existing collection of:
Lord of the Flies
To Kill a Mockingbird
A Tale of Two Cities
Fahrenheit 451
Gulliver&#x27;s Travels
One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest
Now I just need to find the time to re-read them all. Do you have a favorite classic must-read?
Bonus find: An original Sound of Music vinyl record -- this was a super happy find. I initially found a really scratched one, but thankfully found a total of THREE at the thrift store. I was able to pick the one that didn&#x27;t have a lot of scratches on it. Super excited to play it on the record player.

                              <span>I have been preparing for job interviews (looking to get into genai+backend roles you know). I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on Bear Blog for a while. I really like the approach and philosophy. Bear Blog is simple, fast, customizable and focuses on privacy and pure writing. And since some of my favorite blogs also use this blogging platform, I thought I&#x27;d give Bear Blog a try too.

                              <span>I want to start by saying that this will not be a &quot;Bear is best&quot; or &quot;10 reasons why you should switch to Bear&quot; kind of post.
There are many excellent blogging platforms available nowadays. The concept of &quot;better&quot; is not especially relevant. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences and requirements.
This post outlines why I chose Bear after trying many different tools. If your blogging preferences align with mine, then Bear might be the right platform for you too. If you&#x27;re already happy with your current tool, congratulations – no need to keep reading.
Simplicity
At the last minute, I decided to leave this part out. Not that Bear isn&#x27;t easy to use, it&#x27;s very straightforward, but so are most other &quot;indie platforms&quot;. You&#x27;ll be up and running in no time, no matter what you pick.

                              <span>Jonathan Cott has written about the meaning of those stories and rhymes we consider to be for children. He has also written about the childlike nature of certain rock and pop songs, especially certain songs by The Beatles and Donovan. He has interviewed artists, musicians, writers and others from Chinua Achebe to John Lennon and many more. His works refer to everyone from Carl Jung to Tony Bennett; Rollo May to the Old Testament; Greg Bateson to Gaston Bachelard. At times, his ability to connect seemingly disparate phenomena is mind-blowing. Other time, one nods their head knowingly at a reference that they might have often considered just to see it verified via Cott’s quotation and argument tying the two things together. Some might consider his considerations too fanciful while others might see them as so simply obvious they wonder why he bothered to even write them down.

 What makes you think you can govern me? 
 When my mind is about to explode and fling 
 Shrapnel in every direction and into the void 
 For this soul of mine is weeping, while yours gently 
 Blow sleeping in the gaze of protective eyes. 
 Barrage the barricades of your world ‘til they tumble 
 Crumble onto the doorstep of our anarchist utopia? 
 A ticking fission or fusion bomb around the nuclear family - 
 I cannot wait until it disintegrates into ash 
 It never did anything to me - Blood 
 Lines only weave together pain - Choose 
 Your own kind over the abstract confines 
 Of a triple helix with the extra back 
 Bone of suffering. 
 The bigotry ebbs and flows through our collective 
 Memories that we perhaps should forget but cannot 
 Unsee through flashbacks of those who harmed - 
 Us, through bricks at glass and break the institution 
 That hates us - that seeks to eradicate us 
 Yas I may be extreme but was that ever a bad thing - 
 I’ll just shine with the light of a trillion photons 
 Exploding and releasing the energy 
 Of my ungovernable queer self.</span>

 Dear Society, 
 Telling me the way to go - never fit myself into your gender 
 Confines and even in my disruption their compulsion to fit 
 Me into a box flickers behind… shadows. The flames 
 Burning my mind, or am I burning. Fuck. Their stereotypes. 
 You cannot speak up about anything. Be passionate. 
 Rant about ableism and transphobia and they give strange looks 
 And yeah girls can do that, but I’m not one of them… 
 And my identity of being loud… is this just internalized misogyny…? 
 Head and a broken body, too wrong, but I feel no connection to the physical 
 Right…? 
 I guess that’s a lie. Cannot be stoic. Only a fragment.

We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since March 2024. As usual, we wish to remind our readers that the DSGE model forecast is not an official New York Fed forecast, but only an input to the Research staff’s overall forecasting process. For more information about the model and variables discussed here, see our DSGE model Q &amp; A.</span>

I&#x27;ve published a few essays about how journaling has impacted my life by providing the space for me to reflect on my day. One thing I have never done until this year, however, is read any of my old journals.
This may seem strange, since what is the point of writing if not to be read. But that isn&#x27;t why I do it. I write as a practice. As a thing that I do. If all my journals were lost in a house fire, I&#x27;d be sad, yes. But the documentation of my life isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s valuable. That value has already been gleaned through the act itself.

If you do shitposting, people who are here for fun will join (I think most people love shitposting, because even founders sometimes follow me and my mutuals for memes lol). In my experience, shitposting is often authentic. There&#x27;s a lot of space for improv replying and leads to fun interactions -&gt; good connections. People like to have fun together. Everyone should do it. It&#x27;s the backbone of Twitter.

Nothing about the three hostages who were also apparently killed in the Israeli attack, including an American citizen.  More

                              <span>President Biden once pledged to adopt more humane immigration policies than his predecessor.  But in practice, as immigrant rights advocates have documented, his administration has escalated the attack on the legal right of people facing life-threatening conditions to seek safety. Even though this right is guaranteed regardless of how asylum seekers enter the country, he has sought to restrict access to ports of entry. More

                              <span>Neoliberalism seems impermeable to the facts. The theory is that markets are efficient, and privatization, deregulation, and liberalization will bring about the best of all possible worlds, so if the facts don’t fit the theory, so much the worse for the facts. The image that has haunted me is one from the movie The Matrix, where human beings are plugged into a system that has them dreaming of a pleasant alternate reality while their bodies are being sucked dry of the nutrients and energy to feed alien beings.

                              <span>The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It&#x27;s like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).
This perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.
On the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let&#x27;s say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.
Thinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.</span>

                              <span>As we continue to focus our AI research and development on solving increasingly complex problems, one of the most significant and challenging shifts we’ve experienced is the sheer scale of computation required to train large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, our AI model training has involved a training massive number of models that required a comparatively [...]

                              <span>The Ricoh GRIIIx I reserved at the beginning of May finally came in earlier this month. The camera has a bit of a learning curve that I&#x27;m still getting used to, but am really enjoying the portability of it. Although I&#x27;m used to shooting with a 35mm, I&#x27;m still finding myself having to work around a 40mm. I think at the end of the day, this is still better for me than a 28mm (that the GRIII has) since I prefer tighter frames.


Marty&#x27;s Grill has pretty decent Cheesesteak, although obviously not comparable to an authentic Philly Cheesesteak. LSC also seems to like their burgers.

I&#x27;m constantly surprised, and, by this point in my life, I shouldn&#x27;t be, but I am. What of? People who feel the need to constantly be busy or doing this, and that, and, well, the other. Is it something that happened slowly, over night, I wonder? Is it since the advent of smart phones, or maybe TV even? Or was it always there and I just didn&#x27;t notice it?
Because, I&#x27;m of a mind that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to be constantly doing something, anything, or going somewhere to do something (like sports), whether to participate or watch. I&#x27;m not always in front of a screen, or TV. I have a life outside of smart gadgets that involves me walking around a garden, or sitting in a park staring at, well,…</span>

 “Solidarity is a constant attack against the system and society, an act where the words fabrication, innocent, guilty, do not fit. Because as revolutionaries it is our duty to always be guilty for this system, always dangerous and always proud of our choices. We are not persecuted for our ideas, but because it seemed poor to us to not transubstantiate them into actions.” 
 (Gerasimos Tsakalos member of the prisoners cell of C.C.F.).

Communique on the arson against the French press agency (Athens, 3/12/2008)
 While the peaceful citizens where enjoying the coffee break of their inexistance in the paved street of Kolonaki, we set ourselves for once again under the “services” of destruction and prepared a new gift out of idyllic ashes. With these, we send our revolutionary greetings to the French comrades that selected to attack the network of the high speed trains, sabotaging the routes of everyday hurry and anxiety, of a determined pre-set life imposed by the bio-authority to its subjects.

 Welcome to Post-anarchism Today. This is certainly not USA Today, et ce n’est certainement pas Aujourd’hui en France. Indeed, it is a refreshing antidote to all such discourses of modern state capitalism. During its short but colourful existence, post-anarchism has always been libertarian and socialist in its basic philosophical outlook: that’s the anarchism part. But post-@ has also maintained its independence from modern rationalism and modern concepts of subjectivity: that’s the post- part. As I survey post-anarchism today, I find to my surprise and delight that both parts are stronger than ever. It’s now clear t…</span>
