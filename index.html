                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

Title: Black and Red Rags
Date: 3 Oct 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/black-red-rags/

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…</span>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day. 
 Şehîd Tekoşer will always remind us of the fallen comrades,
 the beauty of struggle and the price of the defense of freedom.
 With our grief, we celebrate Lorenzo’s life …</span>

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…</span>

 When I first started my journey as an anarchist, I was incredibly privileged in both my environment and upbringing. I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. 
 Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…</span>

                              <span>Hey: it&#x27;s this story again. As someone who&#x27;s around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I&#x27;ve always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama&#x27;s sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also:
* I went to university and had a great time there
* I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly.
* I talk to women and have had romantic relationships.
* I&#x27;ve had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software.
* While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I&#x27;d say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.
I know DMD severity varies between patients, but I don&#x27;t want this article to discourage people with DMD or with children that have DMD. It can be tough, but I think that modern treatments allow us to lead fairly rich lives outside of Warcraft.</span>

                              <span>FWIW Jeffrey Zeldman is a living legend. He was one of the first print designers to transition to the web, did it well, and wrote about it constantly. He designed the “Batman Forever” website in 1995; it was visited by something like one-third of all Internet users.
He created the Web Standards Project, hugely influential in getting browser manufacturers to support standards rather than pee in the pool. And if you think cross-browser support today is rough, at the time you could reliably crash production browsers with valid CSS.
Never mind A List Apart, one of the best early mailing lists on the web, a kind of transitionary form between Usenet and forums/Discord. And A Book Apart, which published lots of high-quality stuff.
If you develop for the web today, every time a browser behaves as the spec describes, thank Jeffrey Zeldman.</span>

                              <span>To recap OpenAI&#x27;s decisions over the past year:
* They burned up the hype for GPT-5 on 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can&#x27;t quickly replicate.
* They dissolved the safety team.
* They switched to for profit and are poised to give Altman equity.
* All while hyping AGI more than ever.
All of this suggests to me that Altman is in short-term exit preparation mode, not planning for AGI or even GPT-5. If he had another next generation model on the way he wouldn&#x27;t have let the media call his &quot;discount GPT-4&quot; and &quot;tree of thought&quot; models GPT-5. If he sincerely thought AGI was on the horizon he wouldn&#x27;t be eyeing the exit, and he likely wouldn&#x27;t have gotten rid of the superalignment team. His actions are best explained as those of a startup CEO who sees the hype cycle he&#x27;s been riding coming to an end and is looking to exit before we hit the trough of disillusionment.
None of this is to say that AI hasn&#x27;t already changed a lot about the world we live in and won&#x27;t continue to change things more. We will eventually hit the slope of enlightenment, but my bet is that Altman will have exited by then.</span>

                              <span>Unlikely Upvote Button for Bear
Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven&#x27;t liked, your posts?
Say hello to the &quot;unlikely&quot; button. It works like the standard button but doesn&#x27;t display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post&#x27;s popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: &quot;☆&quot;;
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: &quot;Like it?&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: &quot;★&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: &quot;Thank you!&quot;;
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}

See the add-ons page for more Bear customizations.
Update: If you&#x27;re not using the Bearming Theme or simply want a lighter version, ReedyBear has you covered. Thanks for the highlighting tip!</span>

Let’s start at the beginning.
I’ve been writing for most of my life. As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way.

In his hands, “the purge” becomes more than just a narrative device; it embodies a vision in which state-sanctioned violence reaches its grotesque climax. More

                              <span>Sorry time: years ago I worked on a telemedicine web app before telemedicine was nearly as popular as it is today. Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.
Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.
Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.
Since then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers.</span>

                              <span>Since Robert Birming released his Timeline design, I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and including it in some of my pages.
But I was also curious on how I could include it to make a microblog out of a typical Bearblog. Not that you can&#x27;t make short posts on here in a default look, but most of the design of Bearblog and its themes is decidedly for longform content. I wanted something that looks more like a microblogging/short post platform.
&#x3D;&#x3D;Some goals I had in mind for my own microblog:&#x3D;&#x3D;
I didn&#x27;t want these low effort posts to be in the Discovery section; make_discoverable has to be false in the Post preset.
The posts need to mention when they were made; I need to include {{ post_published_date }} in the h4 of the Timeline code.
I want the main page you land on to display the most recent …</span>

                              <span>When I was a child, I grew up in a hoarder home. My mother had me at 16. We lived with my grandmother and her then wife, who kept everything she ever received. I have vivid memories of two things in that house.
The first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.
 

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.

                              <span>I do MRI work, and my gut is that none of the claims about dance vs. exercise would replicate. The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors&#x27; behavioral data doesn&#x27;t show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...
The brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I&#x27;m referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don&#x27;t reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors&#x27; claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p &#x3D; .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p &gt; .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.
In general, my priors on &quot;we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period&quot; are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.</span>

Just so happens that the &quot;love centre&quot; is also the &quot;vomiting centre&quot; along with a load of other stuff. I&#x27;d treat this hand-wavy claim with the same kind of skepticism - your counter-example is an excellent one. I agree that looking at a phone first thing in the morning is a bad idea, but for very different reasons.</span>

On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”
This is interesting to me. It does make some evolutionary sense but at the same time, i wake up every morning and look at my girlfriends face, hopefully that does not subconsciously trigger the same response.

                              <span>Hi Matt, great that you&#x27;re participating here and I&#x27;m broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine&#x27;s conduct.
However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites.
To be entirely blunt it&#x27;s all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it&#x27;s because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance.
If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE&#x27;s conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It&#x27;s not going to go away on its own.</span>

                              <span>Matt - i&#x27;m not your lawyer, but you should shut up.
Employers generally have an obligation to keep personal data confidential, especially sensitive information like a job application.
Whether that applies in this particular case or not, i&#x27;m not going to offer an opinion, but you really should shut up.
I get that it&#x27;s particularly frustrating and hard to feel like you are being unfairly treated or whatever, but shut up anyway.</span>

                              <span>Connectome-adjacent neuroscientist here. Definitely not a dead end! But also definitely not the whole picture.
One of the main open questions in neuroscience right now is how network structure, dynamics, and function are related in the brain. Connectomes provide tremendous insight into structure, but as mentioned this does not generically solve either the dynamics or function problem. For example, for many of these neurons we don&#x27;t have a good understanding of their input-output relationship, and the nature of this relationship can strongly affect the dynamics that emerge in a highly connected network. Individual variability across connectomes, and how connectomes change over development are also a significant issue, but at least for the fly it&#x27;s thought that many of the basic structures are pretty conserved across adult animals, even if many of the details could differ.
Modulo these caveats, knowing the physical network structure of the brain does still impose huge constraints on what kinds of models we should be using for gaining insight into dynamics and function. For example, there are well known areas (the &quot;mushroom bodies&quot;) with specific feed-forward connectivity patterns that are very different from a random recurrent network. Further, there are at least some areas in the fly brain where we think there are indeed quite clean structure-function relationships, e.g. in the central complex of the fly brain, which contains a physical ring of neurons and is thought to support a &quot;bump&quot; of activity that acts as a sort of compass that helps flies navigate via a ring-attractor-like dynamical system. Thus, even though it has many missing pieces, a wiring diagram like this can be tremendously useful for generating hypotheses to guide more targeted experiments and theoretical studies.</span>

                              <span>Always cool to see new mutex implementations and shootouts between them, but I don’t like how this one is benchmarked. Looks like a microbenchmark.
Most of us who ship fast locks use very large multithreaded programs as our primary way of testing performance. The things that make a mutex fast or slow seem to be different for complex workloads with varied critical section length, varied numbers of threads contending, and varying levels of contention.
(Source: I wrote the fast locks that WebKit uses, I’m the person who invented the ParkingLot abstraction for lock impls (now also used in Rust and Unreal Engine), and I previously did research on fast locks for Java and have a paper about that.)</span>

The house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

                              <span>Disclaimer: I wrote this article before OpenAI released o1, which now hides its &quot;reasoning&quot; tokens making them inaccessible through the tiktoken library. I think o1 uses the same base tokenizer as GPT-o, but unfortunately we can no longer observe this directly.
GPT-o introduces a new tokenizer o200k_base, which both doubles the model&#x27;s vocabulary size to 200k (previously 100k with GPT-4) and significantly improves token compression, especially for non-English tokens.

Source: GPT-o release
Compression
For non-Latin scripts, o200k_base achieves significantly higher token compression compared to GPT-4&#x27;s c100k_base, demonstrating more efficient word tokenization.
For example, looking at the Tamil sentence நீ எப்படி இருக்கிறாய்? நான் நல்லா இருக்கேன். (translation: How are you? I am fine.), c10…</span>

The latent iconoclastic potential of Islamicate art has been squandered and instead we have meatspace media empires, fools who have tried to make gold off the back of other fools. In the process we have a contagion of functional illiteracy, cultural apocalypse and no real vibrancy. The Muhammadan spirit is missing from Dawah Inc. There is no real transgression, when Dawah Inc positions itself as a menu item that also includes Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson.

Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

I was feeling rather cooped up earlier so I went out for a walk. Smack in the pouring rain. Thankfully, my sneakers were worn and in need of replacing so getting them soaked wasn&#x27;t the biggest deal; still, one is forced to ask oneself if they&#x27;re capable of making good life decisions when the wind starts howling against your umbrella. By the time I got to the halfway point of my walk, lightning was flashing furiously. Like I said, not a good life decision.
Almost every store was closed today. The only things left running were big corporate: convenience stores and chain cafes. I stopped by a Louisa (Taiwan&#x27;s Starbucks equivalent) and saw that there was only the barista inside.

COBOL&#x27;s promise was that it was human-like text, so we wouldn&#x27;t need programmers anymore.  A lot like &quot;low code&quot; platforms, and now LLM generated code.
The problem is that the average person doesn&#x27;t know how to explain &amp; solve a problem in sufficient detail to get a working solution.  When you get down to breaking down that problem... you become a programmer.
The main lesson of COBOL is that it isn&#x27;t the computer interface/language that necessitates a programmer.</span>

                              <span>That sort of “I googled for 30 seconds, and found a cheaper option, why does this project exist” type response is anti-curiosity and anti-learning.
It is possible that the YouTuber guy is a total idiot and decided to make a $1000 wheelchair instead of buying a $200 one, but that shouldn’t be a default assumption, haha.</span>

Sand of one type goes from the U.S. to The Bahamas to be used in concrete. Sand of another type goes from The Bahamas to the U.S. to be used in aquariums. Specialty sands go to make regulation volleyball courts.</span>

                              <span>Custom fit lightweight wheelchairs are expensive. My Ti-Lite (one of the most popular lightweight chair brands) Aero Z starts at $3k and goes up quickly with wheels and backrest and casters and various other options that I need for sitting 16 hours a day without creating more problems. Insurance covers this for me every 5 years, but of course that&#x27;s not a luxury every one has. Most plans don&#x27;t cover DME 100%.
What Zack and Cambry are doing is great.
(edit) I’d like to add that I think part of being able to drive costs down is that they’re not offering these via insurance so they sidestep the need for FDA approval to market it as a medical device (hence the company name), CMS approval and HCPCS coding and all the regulatory costs that come with that.
Now don&#x27;t get me started on power wheelchair cost...</span>

                              <span>What ever exactly happened, ultimately this is just another corporation trying to disturb people in their ownership of their purchased property, in specific video games. Anyone who really thinks about this topic will start questioning why some company located on an island on the other side of the world should be dictating what I do or don&#x27;t do with a cartridge or disc I paid for with my own money and which is in my possession. It&#x27;s just ludicrous behavior from a group of power-hungry megalomaniacs. This is why it&#x27;s important to claw back as much ownership in that space as possible. If you want things to move in the right direction, you should sign https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci if you&#x27;re an EU citizen, or support them in any other way if you&#x27;re not. This stuff is important and will ultimately decide whether we own things in our life or not, as increasingly more items have critical features that are anchored in the digital world. Without stuff like that we will become digital paupers.</span>

                              <span>I manage a medium-sized browser extension at work. We also offer(ed) it on Firefox. But I have spent the past year struggling to get back into Mozilla store after a manual review. As far as I can tell, there are maybe two reviewers that are based in Europe (Romania?). The turn around time is long when I am in the US, and it has been rife with this same kind of &quot;simple mistake&quot; that takes 2 weeks to resolve. 
&quot;You need a privacy policy&quot;–we already have one. &quot;You are using machine generated and minified code&quot;–no you are looking at the built code, not the included source. &quot;We cannot reproduce your source&quot;-that&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t follow instructions and are in the wrong directory.
Very frustrating.</span>

                              <span>I think it’s reasonable to expect that one of Firefox’s most popular extension publishers gets a higher tier of review service. Gorhill (and other top extension devs) are providing real value to Firefox, and have demonstrated good behavior for years.
This doesn’t mean they should get to publish whatever they want, but if a reviewer is about to reject a high profile plugin, they should get a second set of eyes on it. Which would have obviously caught the mistake here.
Feels like another “Firefox is underinvested in developer relations” story, which is surprising given how much they rely on them.
Edit: honestly the idea that gorhill doesn’t have a dedicated rep at Mozilla is baffling to me. According to their stats the extension has 8.4 million users. They should call him on the phone to let him know there’s a problem with his extension.</span>

I think I can live with the legalization of sports betting if there are strong restrictions against marketing and advertising. If you want to ruin your life that&#x27;s your decision, and you can always just take the same amount of money and bet it on the stock market.

                              <span>Today is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The survival of the PRC is now longer than the Soviet Union, which lasted 74 years. China has nearly one-fifth of the world&#x27;s population and on some measures is the largest economy in the world, although per person national income is only 30% of that of the US.

                              <span>Recent events have heightened awareness of systemic risk stemming from nonbank financial sectors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity demand from nonbank financial entities caused a “dash for cash” in financial markets that required government support. In this post, we provide a quantitative assessment of systemic risk in the nonbank sectors. Even though these sectors have heterogeneous business models, ranging from insurance to trading and asset management, we find that their systemic risk has common variation, and this commonality has increased over time. Moreover, nonbank sectors tend to become more systemic when banking sector systemic risk increases.</span>

I&#x27;ve been writing on the internet for most of the time that I&#x27;ve been alive. I&#x27;ve done it on blogs, I&#x27;ve done it on social media. I&#x27;ve done it for money and I&#x27;ve done it for free. I&#x27;ve done it on Tumblr and on more than one defunct media vertical and in interactive fiction.
Cohost was the first place where it felt like, consistently, someone was always reading. Something about the site&#x27;s design and user culture created a magical space where people approached things with openness and curiosity and willingness to give their time and attention.
This felt like a place where you could write about anything and people would care. I&#x27;ve talked about the Put your Helmet…</span>

it really is precious, sometimes. to look at something and be able to experience it with your senses. it&#x27;s novel, most days. you just do it without thinking.
but then there&#x27;s times when you experience an intangible unreality so strong that it becomes a force in your life that can&#x27;t be measured. we don&#x27;t have scales for that, or weights that add up the unreal intangible space that exists between little lights in a grid &amp; your brain.
there is a space, somewhere within the imagination, that fills in bit by bit over time. like reading a book, making the world come to life, hearing voices, making up the parts that the author never tells you. internet spa…</span>

Atomic Age
Alexandra was born at a very young age, in Germany, to English speaking parents, which confused the hell out of her.
Three Years Later
At aged 3, Alexandra took a very long boat journey with her parents half way around the world, from England to Hong Kong, via South Africa, and never once got sea sick.
Three Years Later
Having survived an earthquake, a 1000 year historic tsunami that lifted a ship out of the harbour, and a mega typhoon that sucked all the windows out of their third story apartment, Alexandra and her family flew back to England for tea and marmalade sandwiches.
Three Years Later
After the heat and humidity of SE Asia, Alexandra and her family spent 3 years shivering in the cold frozen north of Scotland eating a lot of fish and chips. She did, however, get to sit in an English Electric Lightning fighter jet, and has the photographic evidence to prove it.
Three Years Later
What seemed like months but was, in fact, only days, Alexandra and her family arrived, by plane, in Singapore. Having hopped, skipped, and seemingly, jumped, through various countries. Singapore was very similar to Hong Kong minus the earthquake. It did, however, have a lot of tropical fish which Alexandra enjoyed collecting.
Three Years Later
Arriving back in England, on a fancy jet, Alexandra and her family settled back into a boring English life where, secretly, they all longed to be back in SE Asia, anywhere, but the north of England. Whereupon, Alexandra quietly waited for adulthood to arrive.
Six Years Later
Having waited patiently for adulthood to arrive, Alexandra packed a marmite sandwich, her toothbrush, favourite teddy bear, and a lucky button wrapped in a ten shilling note and, like Nelly the elephant, ran away to join the circus. Also known as, at this time, the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force. Where she became an air traffic controller, as it is also known, air is notoriously difficult to control at any given time of the day or night.</span>

Say hello to the latest cub in the Bearming theme family: Timeline.
Here’s an example with the time-focused timeless song In the Year 2525 (further down the page, you’ll find instructions on how to implement it on your blog):
Year 3535
In the year 3535, ain&#x27;t gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lie, everything you think, do and say, is in the pill you took today.
