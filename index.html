Almost 60% of AIPAC’s money comes from corporate CEOs and other top executives from Fortune 500 companies. The largest single donor to the United Democracy Project is Jan Koum, the multibillionaire former CEO of WhatsApp and a regular Republican funder. The biggest institutional contributors to UDP come from FIRE, finance/insurance and real estate sectors. More

                              <span>The Israeli version of the shooting, which the Biden administration swiftly adopted, was quickly shown by witnesses, cellphone videos and a detailed investigation by the Washington Post to be not only implausible but absolute bunk. The murder of Ayşenur Eygi took place at least 20 minutes after the last confrontation between Palestinian villagers and IDF troops. Ayşenur never threw any stones and was never within 200 yards of anyone who did. The rooftop sniper had a clear view of where Ayşenur was standing, talking to her friend Helen, and she couldn’t be confused for a Palestinian “instigator.” For whatever reason, Ayşenur was targeted; the sights of the rifle focused on her head and shot. The bullet that killed her didn’t ricochet off of a tree or a rock or a dumpster. The sniper had a clear shot and took it. As Rachel Corrie’s father, Craig, said this week: “Israel does not do investigations; they do cover-ups.” More

                              <span>President Biden’s neglect of arms control and disarmament means that the next president will inherit a nuclear landscape that is more threatening and volatile than any other since the Cuban missile crisis more than 60 years ago.  The Cuban missile crisis, however, was a wake up call for both President John F. Kennedy and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, leading to a series of arms control and disarmament treaties beginning with the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963.   More

                              <span>The day after the debate, I woke up to the resounding evidence that Harris had floated like a butterfly over the proceedings and occasionally had stung the hapless Trump like a bee. He, I was assured, had done no better on tariffs, Gaza, Ukraine, abortion, climate change, or January 6 than he had with his eloquence over the Springfield protein diet. Then I re-watched the C-Span feed, including the dismal soundbites from the spin rooms, and came to the conclusion that presidential debates are just a variation on Narcissus’s pond in which we only see our own reflections and hear our own words, which explains why debates rarely move the voting dials.

                              <span>The very notion that it is acceptable to tie one&#x27;s health in a civilized nation to having ample cash is clearly anathema to most of the world, but it&#x27;s the way things are in the United States. Countless individuals toil at jobs that do not provide even cursory health coverage. Many individuals who do have some coverage generally try to avoid tapping into many needed health resources due to the sheer cost-inhibitory manner of it all. Co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance, and mandatory first-born deposits will cost you even if you have insurance. We are at a time when even those who have fairly “decent” insurance ration it, many times avoiding care in the early stages of a condition, which often manifests itself later in more expensive and less treatable conditions. The setup of care in the United States is anything but sensible or cost-efficient.  More

I’m beginning to cultivate my own digital garden using Bear.  I’ve created a Pages section that lists all stand-alone pages that aren’t in a standard blog format. It includes slash pages, creative projects, demos, and other resources. It’s a place to play and experiment.
Some Examples
This week, I added a Sketchbook and a collection of Wallpapers.

Neither of these fits into the mold of a traditional blog, but they interest me, and I enjoy working on them. I wanted to find a place where they could live on my website.
I also created a Typography page to test markdown syntax and CSS themes. I initially hid this page but decided to make it public in my new digital garden. It’s just the kind of thing I want growing there.
These pages are all works in process. I’ll be adding new pages and updating existing ones often. Anyone curious can always wander around the garden to see what I’m up to.
Over time, I hope to find connections between the different pages. It is a good way to spark more creative ideas.
None of this replaces my blog. It’s in addition to my blog posts. I don’t think it has to be one format or the other. Your blog can also have an area for a digital garden.
What are your thoughts? Do you like this idea?</span>

                              <span>This is incredible. In April I used the standard GPT-4 model via ChatGPT to help me reverse engineer the binary bluetooth protocol used by my kitchen fan to integrate it into Home Assistant.
It was helpful in a rubber duck way, but could not determine the pattern used to transmit the remaining runtime of the fan in a certain mode. Initial prompt here [0]
I pasted the same prompt into o1-preview and o1-mini and both correctly understood and decoded the pattern using a slightly different method than I devised in April. Asking the models to determine if my code is equivalent to what they reverse engineered resulted in a nuanced and thorough examination, and eventual conclusion that it is equivalent. [1]
Testing the same prompt with gpt4o leads to the same result as April&#x27;s GPT-4 (via ChatGPT) model.
Amazing progress.

i have also written and designed a visual novel called ESC, and am currently working on a brand new game called ANOTHEREAL. i’ll be introducing the game &amp; talking about its development in these little blogs, so stay tuned if you want to find out more!
separately, i’ve also been known to blog about games, music, and other things that interest me. i had an ongoing series of longer posts on the website Cohost, which I’m no longer able to continue due to it shutting down. i hope to use this blog to keep the long-form posting alive. so if you like(d) reading my thoughts on games and other media, those will continue here as well!</span>

i was contemplating setting up a newsletter, and that is well and dandy, but ultimately there’s a lot of baggage that comes from blasting out emails to everyone’s inboxes every time i want to write something on a whim. that’s not necessarily what i’m here for!
i&#x27;ve done my best to port over &amp; fill out the archive with some of my game blogs and other ‘best of’ from cohost, tagging those where appropriate! and then we’ll keep on going… i hope you’ll stick around, subscribe to the rss or atom feed, whatever keeps you updated!
so if you’re new here, have a little dose of introduction:

On Bear, I have regularly shared light, easily digestible reads, like slices of life and productivity takes. But I have also shared the brutal reality of living with mental health struggles.
I created this blog during the peaks of a depressive episode, at a time I desperately sought a healthy outlet for my oppressive emotions and ricocheting thoughts. Actually, it was an attempt to abide by my psychologist&#x27;s advice, who urged me to live for myself, do things I love. I promised myself to write about what matters to me, what I always wanted to share - life updates, opinions, introspections, and most importantly, my mental health journey.

It&#x27;s ten in the morning. I&#x27;m sitting on a wooden chair in my room. A
breeze brings a hint of fragrant morning dew through the open window. The robins are screaming their good mornings and the first maple leaves are starting to burn mauve and brown and let go of their branches. I slept wonderfully last night — a deep, dreamless slumber — and while that is likely the result of accumulated sleep debt, there is something about this place that puts me at ease. I love the chorus of cicadas and crickets, the verdant air, the quiet rush of cars passing by, the caress of my velvet bedspread, the pale yellow walls surrounding me, even the intermittent buzz…</span>

                              <span>I slowly got into a blog when I retired and decided to give Micro.blog a whirl. I was intrigued by the notion of a community, as I had long been receiving weekly emails with samples of the “Discovery Feed”. I mostly did true “micro posts” for quite a while, then I tried my hand at few long form posts. I got into photo posting, and eventually did a 30 day photo challenge. I also got into the bookshelf feature and posted more than two years of my reading to my blog site.
There came a time when I felt like I had disclosed too much personal information. I realized, for example, that I had always hated that there were digital records of what I read at the library and records of anything I bought at Amazon. This gets at a fundamental issue we all have with all electronic records and communication. I decided last December to “nuke” that blog in its entirety.
I continued to micro post there for a while, and to do several entries that I thought were innocuous. I then looked around at my options, including weblog.lol and bearblog.dev (this blog). The community features at Micro-blog simply didn’t amount to much, after all. Good, but it felt like it could be great. So, I came over here to bearblog.dev and started afresh.
While I still ponder what is too much disclosure, or too little for that matter, I feel like even being factual about some of my past might be a turn off to many potential readers. Lord knows, there aren’t many actual readers. It feels like people want to hear a certain kind of experience, but not hear about others. I am not sure I have the “voice” to be appealing, so I could just file my little essays away privately. I do still seek community, but I find the interaction is on Mastodon (social.lol for me) and that is good.
I’ll poke away at this for a while. None too sure of its longevity.

                              <span>Today, I heard an interview with the Swedish guitarist Janne Schaffer, known for his work with ABBA and Bob Marley, among other things.
He was asked to name the world&#x27;s 30 best songs. Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys came in at the top. No surprise there, but then something unexpected happened...
On the same top list, the 78-year-old guitarist included Levitating by Dua Lipa from 2020. That&#x27;s so refreshing! Someone born in 1945 choosing a song that&#x27;s only four years old.
I hope I can continue to be as curious about the contemporary world throughout my life. New music, literature, films, places, experiences…
A constant journey of discovery. Always curious. That&#x27;s the recipe for a youthful mind and a happy life.</span>

                              <span>As a kid, I was sensitive and unhappy about several things, mainly my name. My full name on my birth certificate is Louis Kimbal Plummer. The Louis is from a high school classmate of my parents, ostensibly my Godfather, although I&#x27;m not really sure what that even means. He and my Dad are still friends today and I see him occasionally. I even worked for him for a while in the 80s.
My middle name, Kimbal, came about through British colonialism. Seriously. My Mom read Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s book, Kim, about Kimball O&#x27; Hara (Kim), who is the orphaned son of a soldier in the Irish regiment stationed in India during the British Raj. It describes Kim&#x27;s life and adventures from street vagabond to his adoption by his father&#x27;s regiment and recruitment into espionage. After I was born, Kim was what they d…</span>

 1. the vandalism of capitalist propaganda 
 2. subvertising; parodies of advertisements 
 3. protest art to hide advertisement. 
 Our main goal is removing advertisement from the public space. 
 As citizens we should have a say in how our public space looks, we do not accept government renting out the space to some companies, that is supposed to be for all of us. 
 We accept bus stop advertisement as a method to support the bus stop. But there is no excuse for stand alone advertisement in the public space, in this zine we will show some tactics to rem…</span>

Abstract
 The article explores the theoretical complicities between the thought of Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille. Taking as a starting point the anecdote of the Book of Passages, according to which Benjamin would have entrusted this manuscript to the care of Bataille, questions are raised about the possible link between the two thinkers. The relationship that both authors maintained with the leftist political thought of the time and the way in which their revolutionary conceptions distance themselves from orthodox Marxism and dialectical materialism are particularly problematized. In this way, through an analy…</span>

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>David Chang is a salesman and a businessman first. I get the point being made, but keep in mind that he is a brand, and part of that is the stories he tells.
He has slapped his name on so many subpar food goods that were a total disappointment that I actually have started avoiding things marketed under his brand name.
He might do things the hard way in his restaurants, but they certainly aren&#x27;t ensuring tasty or high quality goods under his brand. I would rather he do things in a way that makes sense and provides the best tasting food.
More broadly, the point is that you should take advice only from people whose successes you want to emulate. The actual advice I get out of this article is:
Tell stories that paint the picture you want your customers to have about your product.</span>

That felt like a huge breach of privacy.  Given that equifax had already proven incompetent at keeping my data secure, I immediately sent HR a request to stop sending my supposedly &#x27;confidential&#x27; pay info.  They politely told me to kick rocks, so I went on TWN&#x27;s website and froze that report so no one would be able to request it, and it will be a cold day in hell before I thaw it.</span>

Basically, HR at many companies gives your salary and employment history data to Equifax, who then sells access to the information to certain parties with supposed need to access it, including potential and current employers and creditors.  This report is likely one of the most invasive consumer files out there for many people.
I cannot comment on the legality of this kind of data sharing, but as I and others have pointed out, it has existed for a while.  I do agree that it is concerning.  You can freeze your Equifax The Work Number report at least, just like other credit reports.

&gt; As part of our research, we discovered that a few years ago the WHOIS server for the .MOBI TLD migrated from whois.dotmobiregistry.net to whois.nic.mobi – and the dotmobiregistry.net domain had been left to expire seemingly in December 2023.
Never ever ever ever let a domain expire. If you&#x27;re a business and you&#x27;re looking to pick up a new domain because it&#x27;s only $10/year, consider that you&#x27;re going to be paying $10/year forever, because once you associate that domain with your business, you can never get rid of that association.</span>

 There is but a simple difference between the standpoint of those collectivists who believe that it is useless to vote to abolish the right of inheritance after having voted &quot;for collective property, and that of those collectivists who think, as do we, that it is useful and even necessary to do so. 
 They place themselves entirely in the future and, taking collective property as their point of departure, discover that there is no longer any good reason to be concerned with the right of inheritance.

 We have stated from the very start that the beginning of a full-scale war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 is an imperialist aggression of the Russian state. That is still true. 
Our position on the war in Ukraine
“Autonomous Action” is not on the side of the Ukrainian state — and not on the side of any other state. However, in the current circumstances, the victory of Russia is not beneficial to the peoples of neither Ukraine, nor Russia, nor Belarus. Fighting against Russian aggression is now beneficial to everyone except the Kremlin. It is easy to see why it is beneficial to the Ukrainian authorities. But why is it also beneficial to people (and, accordingly…</span>

 Born in 2013, WARZONE DISTRO free zine project, stands at the intersection of nihilist, anti-civilization anarchy, and total liberation, bridging gaps between veganism, straight edge, and insurrectionary thought. WARZONE DISTRO is dedicated to challenging the very foundations of oppression, wherever it festers, and in whatever form. 
 In our interview below, we delve into the radical philosophy driving WARZONE DISTRO, exploring how they blend anarchist and vegan ideals to craft a vision of true total liberation. We talk about the unique ch…</span>

Title: Bias
Date: 09-09-2024

 Along the horridly neglected path out of being commanded and subjected, from the stinking bowels of the societies of oiled gears, permanent emissions, bright screens, information haze and ceaseless masturbation to worn-out sensibility, there arises a shrill hissing of such stupid nature, of such whining entitlement, that the lone rebel catches herself snickering — then nearly dying laughing . . . 
 &quot;You have a left-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a right-wing bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have a centrist bias!&quot; 
 &quot;You have an extremist bias!&quot; 
 Ha! Ahahaha! Ah, the acrid hell of human hubris knows no end! The sheer closeness in conceptual capacity to being god — yet holding oneself back at the last second …</span>

Title: Blackness and Democratic Modernity
Date: January 10, 2023

 “Modernity as a concept means time, the present. There are different moderns, depending on the age. From Sumerian modernity to Roman modernity, and even before and after them, there have been…many examples of modernity.” 
 Abdullah Öcalan, The Sociology of Freedom
 “The Negro’s revolutionary history is rich, inspiring, and unknown. Negroes revolted against the slave raiders in Africa; they revolted against the slave traders on the Atlantic passage. They revolted on the plantations. The docile Negro is a myth… The only place where Negroes did not revolt is in the pages of capitalist historians.”

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursi…</span>

                              <span>This post will be very plain. That is because Bear Blog is excellent in a way that is obvious and requires little explaining.  Bear Blog is a minimalistic blogging service that will store your posts and serve them without fluff and at great speed. As Tildes blogging brother, Bear Blog has nothing in excess. At the same time, it allows you complete access to the CSS style, as well as other elements, to the point that it is entirely possible to achieve a layout that resembles a traditional page rather than a blog. Not that I would want that myself, but that looks entirely achievable to me.
It pleases me that Bear Blog doesn&#x27;t have built-in comments, nor does it have any essential element that goes against its simply stated core goals. In fact, if you look at its roadmap, you will notice that…</span>

The site then sat there and did nothing, but that was fine, because I didn&#x27;t need to have an actual blog, I had cohost1 for any kind of longer-than-a-tweet writing I wanted to do.
Then two things happened.
First, I got nervous about social media. I feel weird about the way it works and the kind of interaction it encourages, and especially the way endless feeds hijack my ADHD brain. I decided to put all my accounts essentially on hold, including my cohost, and not post for a while, figuring I&#x27;d come back eventually. In the mean time, maybe I&#x27;d start blogging again?

                              <span>My work life is on a precipice; we are shortly moving into another building in another part of the city, to consolidate with another. This building has been tentatively sold, and the new building was recently renovated (and being renovated again, to accommodate studio space) and is much nicer. There will be more people there, a complete change from the silent hallways of the current building.
But this building wasn&#x27;t always this way. At one point it was tough to get a parking spot, and you had to park in a city-owned gravel parking lot next door until something opened up. But many rounds of layoffs has emptied out the building - there are barely 10 people on the first floor alone on a good day. It&#x27;s quiet, and I&#x27;ve grown used to it.
The new building? It&#x27;s quiet-ish, but there are definitel…</span>

                              <span>I needed to clear my head, so I went for a run (yesterday).
And then since I was doing cardio anyways, I figured I might as well turn it into a full workout session by adding some strength training. Instead of sticking to my usual Peloton run / strength classes, I decided to go off-script.
Ever since getting our Peloton bike in 2021, my workouts have been some sort of Peloton class: bike, strength, stretch, and now run. I was obsessed with my Peloton streak (that is non-existent now since I took a break), and so no matter what I did, it was a Peloton class.
Yesterday, I just wanted to enjoy my workout without the pressure of having to follow the instructor cues, adhering to the class length, or having to listen to someone else’s music playlist. I wanted the freedom to move at my own pace; run as fast or slow as I wanted, or rest longer/shorter in between reps.
Although I took a break from a consistent workout routine due to other life things, the pressure to complete some streak or decide which class fits my current mood, made me not want to work out.
It was nice to just be able to do my own thing, at my own pace. I know that people typically don’t take classes during their workouts but if you’re used to structured classes, and feel overwhelmed by the routine, switch things up. Sometimes the best way to restart a routine that becomes not-so-fun anymore is to let go of the rules and simply just enjoy the process.
And if you must know, my workout playlist consisted of a lot of Eminem.

                              <span>The year is 2024. Social media is melting down and locking down their content behind increasingly expensive APIs. Websites are increasing ads to a ridiculous degree because they aren&#x27;t as profitable as they used to be. The first 5 articles on top of Google are garbage created using AI specifically tuned to maximize search engine optimization. 90% of comments on that one review you read are astroturfing accounts trying to sell you something. Youtube still cannot stop the &quot;pu$$y In BIO!!&quot; spam comments.
The bad news everyone figured out is that the internet is getting more chaotic and buckling under the stress of spam and bot accounts running around everywhere. The worse news is that nobody knows what to do about it.
That&#x27;s why I think blogging has become so important. You get to read though…</span>

                              <span>Part of the reason I sadly stopped running any exit nodes was law enforcement harassment.
I ran a few exits for about about ~5 years. In those 5 years, my hosting provider (DigitalOcean) received 3 subpoenas for my account information.
The first two were random. The 1st one was someone sent a bomb threat email to a university. The 2nd one was someone sending a phishing email.
The last and final subpoena was the most serious one. Some nation-state hackers from Qatar had ended up using my exit IP to break into some email accounts belonging to people they were interested in and spied upon them and stole some info.
Thankfully both the Tor Project and the EFF were able to help me pro-bono. The EFF lawyer that was assigned to me helped me fight this subpoena but ultimately we had to turn over my account information to the DOJ + I had to give an affidavit stating that I was simply just an operator and nothing on the server in question would be useful to their investigation (by design).
The stress of having to deal with law enforcement, lawyers, and having to entertain the possibility of having my home raided over something so silly ultimately led to me finally shutting down my exits.
Even though I had all of my exits using a reduced exit policy and I would blacklist known malicious IPs and c2/malware infra from being able to use it, I was still a target.
I feel law enforcement realizes this is a big weakness they can target since a lot of Tor exit operators are individuals with not a lot of resources to fight them. They can use the legal system to scare operators into shutting down.
I one day hope to resume running exits as I find it rewarding to be able to help people from around the world in a small way.</span>

&gt; In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced.

                              <span>For non-EU readers, note that taxation is explicitly not a competency of the EU (i.e. Ireland can set its tax levels to whatever it wants). The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn&#x27;t, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists.</span>

Abstract
 The question of solidarity is an important one for anarchism. However, so far solidarity as a concept has not been given the philosophical attention it deserves. In this paper I wish to fill in this gap in the anarchist literature and discuss solidarity from the perspective of Peter Sloterdijk’s work. I will examine the key features of Sloterdijk’s theory of spheres and claim that his spherology can be useful for thinking about solidarity in the context of anarchism. Slot…</span>

Title: Anarchists Against Counter-Revolution
Date: 9/7/2024

 There has been a disturbing trend within anarchism in the last few years. It could be called the right wing of anarchism, liberal anarchism, anarchism in name only, or reformism. Whatever it is called, people who believe that they are anarchists have taken positions that side with colonizers, nation-states, and western hegemony. 
 The most glaring of these positions are: 1) the Resistance in Palestine should not be supported or should only be partially supported because Hamas is not sufficiently &#x27;anarchist.&#x27; 2) Money and solidarity should be sent to &#x27;anarchist&#x27; batt…</span>

 Note: The present passage was written on 11-16 December 2002 (period of the Cyprus entry into the European Union) by anarchist prisoner Giorgos Garakasian in the jails of free Cypriot democracy. 
 Through the general secretary of United Criminals Kofi Annan the Americans and British have been attempting for some time now to impose a ‘fair and viable solution’ upon the inhabitants of Cyprus. 
 The period that we are living in is characterized by the reorganization of global dominion, which has completed its first phase of ‘anti-terrorist’ hysteria with the devastating intervention in Afgha…</span>

                              <span>They need to crack down on companies that ruin hardware (or will one day ruin hardware) when they shut off their last cloud server.
There&#x27;s no excuse for an appliance to brick itself or lose functionality just because of the manufacturer&#x27;s remote action. When I buy a device, I don&#x27;t want a perpetual, tethered relationship with the manufacturer in order to work the device. I don&#x27;t want it to ask the manufacturer for permission to run every day. I don&#x27;t want it to be dependent on the manufacturer to keep it alive. I don&#x27;t want to create an account. I don&#x27;t want to log in to the manufacturer&#x27;s servers. I don&#x27;t want them to know my IP address or my home address. Leave me alone, I&#x27;m just not that into you!
A hardware device should work on day 10,000 just as it worked on day 1. If you as a company can&#x27;t do that, you should not be able to sell the device (EDIT: OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as &quot;dependent on the manufacturer&#x27;s servers&quot;)</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know that I completely agree. To some degree, sure — most folks probably don&#x27;t notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.
But my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she&#x27;d have no idea what the term &quot;continuity&quot; means in this context. She notices that it&#x27;s easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it&#x27;s so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there&#x27;s very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn&#x27;t need to write down passwords anymore.
I think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don&#x27;t have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity — long before my mother did — it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I&#x27;m a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.
I&#x27;m also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they&#x27;re switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.</span>

                              <span>&gt; If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.
Battery replacement costs at Apple are $69-99 and offered all the way back to the iPhone SE 1st Generation. That&#x27;s the all-in cost where you bring it in, they open it up, swap it out, and give your phone back to you.
An OEM battery for an Android phone is like $50.
Budgeting $69-99 once every 3-4 years hardly seems like it&#x27;s going to nuke their business from orbit.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m conflicted.
It&#x27;s absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models &quot;boring&quot;.
The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I&#x27;ll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.
She can&#x27;t tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.
You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn&#x27;t know how to get back.
You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn&#x27;t notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn&#x27;t know they even exist.
All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.
You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she&#x27;s highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It&#x27;s not that she&#x27;s unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn&#x27;t care.
It&#x27;s becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.
I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don&#x27;t buy the pro and they&#x27;re desperate for selling points in the regular model.
If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.</span>

                              <span>You sound like you&#x27;re proud of this work and this plan and this sequence of events.
code.google going away, without the excuse that google itself was going away, after I had started to rely on it and link to it in docs and scripts all over the place, is what taught me to never depend on google for anything.
If google had said &quot;The purpose of this service is an academic goal of Googles, not to serve users needs. This service will be shut off as soon as Googles academic purpose is met.&quot; I would not have used it.
But Google did not say that. Google presented the service as a service whos purpose was to be useful to users. And only because of that, we used it.
Do you see the essential problem here? Effectively, Google harnessed users for it&#x27;s own purposes without their consent by means of deception. The free-ness of the service  that the users received doesn&#x27;t even count as a fair trade in a transaction because the transaction was based on one party misinforming the other.
So thanks for all your work making the world a better place.</span>

notes:
- photos/album search now includes video understanding, which imo seems very good from the first 2 examples they showed. includes scroll to exact time of the moment you describe.
- Mail and Notifications will show summaries instead of str[:x]
- Siri now knows iPhone, becomes the ultimate manual on how to use the increasingly complicated iOS 18. and can read your texts (!) to suggest actions with Personal Context Understanding (also it will try to advertise apple tv shows to you... i&#x27;m SURE it will be totally objective and aligned to your preferences amirite)
- new iphone 16 camera control button is PRIME real estate - notice how OpenAI/ChatGPT is now next to Google search, and both are secondary clicks to Apple&#x27;s visual search, which comes first
- camera adds events to calendar!
- &quot;all done on device&quot; and on cloud (though craig doesnt say that haha)
overall i think insanely good ideas on ai + phone integrations.</span>

Is anyone here actually excited about the features they just announced? Or are people simply upgrading because they get the latest iPhone every year or two by default?</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s a good article. The whole history is there.
The commercial side has made huge progress, too. Look up &quot;diamond making machine&quot; on Alibaba. You can buy a high-pressure, high temperature six sided press for about US$200,000. A chemical vapor deposition machine is about the same price.
De Beers, the diamond cartel, has an R&amp;D operation, Element Six. They sell synthetic diamonds for lasers and other exotic applications. The technology is good enough to achieve flaw levels in the parts per billion range, and to make diamond windows for lasers 10cm across.[1]
This is way above jewelry grade.
Over on the natural diamond side, there&#x27;s been a breakthrough. The industry used to break up some large diamonds during rock crushing. Now there&#x27;s a industrial X-ray system which is used to examine rocks before crushing to find diamonds. It&#x27;s working quite well. A 2500 carat diamond was found recently.[1][2] TOMRA, which makes high-volume sorters for everything from recyclables to rice, has a sorter for this job. This is working so well that there&#x27;s now something of a glut of giant diamonds too big for jewelry.
The finishing processes of cutting and polishing have been automated. The machinery for that comes mostly from China and India.
Diamonds are now something you can buy by the kilo, in plastic bags.

                              <span>I have mild tinnitus and the best advice I&#x27;ve ever read on the internet for it is: Stop reading. Don&#x27;t look up information about tinnitus. Don&#x27;t think about it. If you happen to notice it, try to distract yourself immediately. There maybe legitimate hearing damage but for the psychological aspect, the more you think about it the worse it becomes. I think I saw a quora answer somewhere where the doctor said &quot;Nobody complains about tinnitus while playing Playstation&quot;. And it&#x27;s very true. Until this post just now, I hadn&#x27;t thought about it in weeks (months?).</span>

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31110206
This articles about the open source distribution side but I will also point out that the number of developers who don’t realise your remote GitHub repo can be located on any machine with an ssh connection and nothing more is surprising. As in people use private GitHub repos thinking that’s THE way you work with git. If GitHub was just for open source hosting I suspect they’d have trouble monetising like sourceforge clearly did which led to scammy attempts to make money. But they always had this huge usage of private GitHub repos supporting the rest. This must have helped a lot imho.</span>

                              <span>Actually, Google Code was never trying to win.
It was simply trying to prevent SF from becoming a shitty monoculture that hurt everyone, which it was when Google Code launched.  Google was 100% consistent on this from the day it launched to the day it folded. It was not trying to make money, or whatever
I was there, working on it, when it was 4 of us :)
So to write all these funny things about taste or what not, is totally besides the point.
We folded it up because we achieved the goal we sought at the time, and didn&#x27;t see a reason to continue.
People could get a good experience with the competition that now existed, and we would have just ended up cannibalizing the market.
So we chose to exit, and worked with Github/bitbucket/others to provide migration tools.
All of this would have been easy to find out simply by asking, but it appears nobody bothers to actually ask other people things anymore, and I guess that doesn&#x27;t make as good a story as &quot;we totally destroyed them because they had no taste, so they up and folded&quot;.</span>

                              <span>There are a number of concrete problems:
- syscall interfaces are a mess, the primitive APIs are too slow for regular sized packets (~1500 bytes), the overhead is too high. GSO helps but it’s a horrible API, and it’s been buggy even lately due to complexity and poor code standards.
- the syscall costs got even higher with spectre mitigation - and this story likely isn’t over. We need a replacement for the BSD sockets / POSIX APIs they’re terrible this decade. Yes, uring is fancy, but there’s a tutorial level API middle ground possible that should be safe and 10x less overhead without resorting to uring level complexity.
- system udp buffers are far too small by default - they’re much much smaller than their tcp siblings, essentially no one but experts have been using them, and experts just retune stuff.
- udp stack optimizations are possible (such as possible route lookup reuse without connect(2)), gso demonstrates this, though as noted above gso is highly fallible, quite expensive itself, and the design is wholly unnecessarily intricate for what we need, particularly as we want to do this safely from unprivileged userspace.
- several optimizations currently available only work at low/mid-scale, such as connect binding to (potentially) avoid route lookups / GSO only being applicable on a socket without high peer-competition (competing peers result in short offload chains due to single-peer constraints, eroding the overhead wins).
Despite all this, you can implement GSO and get substantial performance improvements, we (tailscale) have on Linux. There will be a need at some point for platforms to increase platform side buffer sizes for lower end systems, high load/concurrency, bdp and so on, but buffers and congestion control are a high complex and sometimes quite sensitive topic - nonetheless, when you have many applications doing this (presumed future state), there will be a need.</span>

                              <span>I’ve been building and deploying thousands of stacks on first Docker, then Mesos, then Swarm and now k8s. If I have learned one thing from it, it’s this: it’s all about the second day.
There are so many tools that make it easy to build and deploy apps to your servers (with or without containers) and all of them showcase how easy it is to go from a cloud account to a fully deploy app.
While their claims are true, what they don’t talk about is how to maintain the stack, after “reclaiming” it. Version changes, breaking changes, dependency changes and missing dependencies, disaster recovery plans, backups and restores, major shifts in requirements all add up to a large portion of your time.
If you have that kind of team, budget or problem that deserves those, then more power to you.</span>

Title: The Cell Phone and Its Double
Date: 09/02/2024
Source: https://unravel.noblogs.org/the-cell-phone-and-its-double/

 Cellular phones are common targets for digital surveillance, along with all the software and applications they enable. These phones can be purchased anonymously — in person, in cash, with a covid mask and hat, and with a car parked far away — meaning only surveillance footage of the purchase is available once you walk out of the store. Yet, after purchasing these devices, we often bring them to houses, apartments, squats, camps, and hideouts. Cellular phones can be tracked using GPS or triangulation information from the cellular network provider, to determine your identity after purchase. Here we discuss a method to minimize the risk of unintentionall…</span>

                              <span>Image Gallery for Bear Blog
This gallery add-on for the Bearming theme is the first where I felt a separate page was needed. It&#x27;s also been the hardest to make – a good example of the joy of limitations.
Actually, the gallery add-on itself isn&#x27;t very complicated. The challenge has been to make it fairly simple for anyone to use, and making it compatible with Markdown. Here&#x27;s the result (instructions below):









Instructions
The gallery uses an unordered list, and the list is wrapped around a div (a &quot;section&quot;) with the class gallery. Example:


* ![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* ![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* ![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Since the page becomes quite heavy if you have many images in the gallery, I recommend using smaller versions and linking them to the original image. Example:


* [![Photo 1](https:/link-to-photo-1-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-1.jpg)
* [![Photo 2](https:/link-to-photo-2-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-2.jpg)
* [![Photo 3](https:/link-to-photo-3-thumbnail.jpg)](https:/link-to-photo-3.jpg)



Finally, add the following styles to your theme:
/* Gallery */
.gallery ul  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
  padding: 20px 0;
  list-style: none;
}
.gallery li {
  position: relative;
  flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px);
}
.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


There have been some improvements to the Bear media center in recent days. Hopefully Herman has more in the works. I would love to see thumbnails created automatically and the ability to copy the Markdown code for embedding images, not just the URL.
I hope you find the gallery useful!</span>

                              <span>I’ve been testing the new Camp Snap 103 version the past few months, and it’s officially available so that means I can tell you all about it now.
For those who are new around here, I’ve written a little bit about my initial Camp Snap Adventure, as well as when the first version of the Camp Snap retro filter came out. Here’s another post I wrote about my favorite screen-free digital camera.
So back to the update…
Key Updates
Changing the date and time (metadata) is super easy straight out of the box. Now it’s much easier to organize your photos by the timestamp.
You will also be able to toggle through the volume (3 levels) of your camera in that same section where you can change the date (bottom of the camera hidden by a panel you have to unscrew).
There is an updated shutter sound. I much prefer this one to the older sound. The shutter sound also triggers as you’re turning off the camera, which can get confusing, but you get used to it.
A battery meter has been added. When you’re charging, it will say FULL when charging has been completed. It will also show the battery meter in percentage as soon as you turn on the camera for a few seconds.
The long awaited camera loops so you can attach a lanyard are now available.
The counter is now an LCD instead of LED, so it will no longer blind you when youre out taking photos at night.
Updated vintage filter - the colors lean more magenta than green (see sample photos).
The response between clicking the shutter button and the camera actually taking the photo is so much faster now. I took quite a few photos from a slow moving car, and they didn’t turn out blurry!
…and of course, much better photo quality that renders the highlights SO. MUCH. BETTER.
Sample photos
Photos taken with the new vintage filter, all straight out of the camera with absolutely no edits.
If you&#x27;re interested in getting your hands on a Camp Snap, feel free to use CAMP51 at checkout for $5 off your order at campsnapphoto.com. Looks like they&#x27;re shipping these new cameras now.

                              <span>When I was first diagnosed with depression, I found myself going down the rabbit hole - Reddit posts from ten years ago, outdated mental health forums, and scattered blogposts written by other people with depression. In a sense, I felt like a pariah compared to my peers, and I was curious how depression manifests in others compared to me, because, despite living with this condition for years, I was clueless about what it was.
People tend to think that the most telltale sign of depression is sadness, but I discovered depression manifests overwhelmingly different across individuals: those who experience the crushing sadness, those with the intense mood swings, or those with detachment from their lives. There are depressed people who neglect hygiene for days, people who live in messy rooms ov…</span>

Title: ‘Towards an Archaeology of the Future’: Theodora Kroeber and Ursula K Le Guin

 On 20th August, 1911, an amazing thing happened: a man walked out of one world and entered another. He had walked further perhaps than any other man in history: several thousand years, by some people’s reckoning, from the Stone Age to the Age of Steam, from ‘Inside the World’ (as the Kesh would call it) to a place ‘Outside’ it,…</span>
