                              <span>&quot;Is anyone seriously thinking a lone AM transmitter 2000 miles away is going to help?&quot;
It&#x27;s not for me to explain why in detail here but AM radio communications is the best value for money of any communications system outside of telegraphy (wired or wireless). It&#x27;s cheap, simple, easy to construct, and it&#x27;s scalable to any size (and transmission distance) that&#x27;s needed.
AM radio is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century and it&#x27;s far from outdated.
Come the Bomb and or next war and if you have any communications at all then it will almost certainly be AM Radio.
AM Radio can be local or long distance and cover the world depending on frequency. Years ago during a sunspot maxima, I watched a friend of mine located in NSW Australia talk to someone in California on 27MHz AM using only three watts of power (from a handheld CB radio) and using only a whip antenna.
I defy you or anyone to come up with a simper technology that can do that. If you want to cover say the continental US with radio during, say, a national emergency when nothing else works then it&#x27;ll be AM radio that comes to the rescue. This simply is why AM radios ought to be made mandatory in every vehicle.
This is not even an argument, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</span>

According to the Tonawanda Seneca Nation, the USFWS approved the Genesee County Economic Development Center’s (GCEDC) construction of the 9.5-mile pipeline without conducting a sufficient environmental review and without a government-to-government consultation with the Nation—in direct violation of their sovereign rights.

On April 1, the administration of Pitzer College in Claremont, California, outside of Los Angeles, announced that it would be suspending its student exchange program with the University of Haifa in Israel. The following day, the Dean of Faculty’s Office claimed in a statement that the decision to suspend the program did not “reflect an academic boycott,” but “lack of enrollments for at least five years, exchange imbalance, or curricular overlap.” The statement could have passed for a belated April Fool’s Day joke, seeing as how students and faculty at Pitzer and other schools belonging to the consortium of Claremont Colleges had been demanding their institutions sever ties with the Israeli economy and academia due to the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza, which has killed at least 34,488 Palestinians, including 14,500 children and 8,400 women, according to Al Jazeera at the time of this writing.

                              <span>I think the biggest thing with this is reliability. I&#x27;ve got a half a dozen cellular radios lying around my house (cellphones) of which exactly one is functional. Even if I paid for a new sim for the others... I&#x27;m not sure some of them could work at all with current transmitters, even if the hardware was functional.
I&#x27;ve got an AM/FM radio that&#x27;s 20-30 years old and it still works. At some point it would be nice if we could get back to vendor-agnostic wireless protocols that aren&#x27;t obsolete every 10 years. Until we have such a thing deprecating AM seems premature.</span>

Employers have trouble finding good staff that they can pay peanuts.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been doing this for years.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m looking for a job now and there&#x27;s no escape from it.  The job sites, the agencies, the employers&#x27; sites - they are all awful.
The best one was an employer&#x27;s site that described itself as &quot;Easy Apply&quot;!  You had to give it a resume, which it parsed, badly, and sprayed randomly into about a thousand text boxes.  I thought maybe the problem was starting with a pdf, so I began again with a Word document.  The results were exactly the same, suggesting they exported to pdf and used the same shitty parser.
Having to rearrange all this text into the correct boxes was annoying enough, but they weren&#x27;t just vanilla text boxes.  They were janky javascript abominations that responded to input really slowly.
And employers moan that they have trouble finding good staff.</span>

                              <span>As I become older (and grumpier) I have realized that not engaging is the best thing to do, wherever possible. Dirty  restaurant / rude staff? Don&#x27;t go there. Don&#x27;t like dark patterns on a website? Contact forms don&#x27;t work? Don&#x27;t use those sites. And so on. Two reasons - first, most of the time, these businesses know their shit is broken or they&#x27;re doing low quality work etc. They just don&#x27;t care. Second, it is good for our own stress levels to avoid dealing with shitty stuff.
Obviously this can&#x27;t be applied to essential services like healthcare etc.</span>

                              <span>I am skeptical.
Well before AI co-pilots something happened to the good old admins--they started to disappear only to be replaced by &quot;AWS devops&quot; (their job titles) who have never wired a network using routers, switches, and cables. I noticed that they started lacking basic networking knowledge and couldn&#x27;t set up networking inside AWS. They just didn&#x27;t know what a gateway, NAT, or subnet is.
Similar things are happening with AI co-pilots. We have an increasing number of people who &quot;write code&quot;, but the number of people who can understand and review code is not increasing. There is also a problem of injecting ethics and politics into those tools, which can produce silly results. I asked Bard to write me a Python function to turn the US Constitution into a palindrome. Bard refused and gave ma a lecture on how the US Constitution is too important to be played with in such trivial fashion. I then asked it to produce code that turns the US national anthem into a palindrome, it refused again. So I asked it do the same but with the Russian national anthem and it spat out code without telling me off. I then asked it to generate code for simple tasks and it did an OK job, except the formatting and the fonts used were different every time, because it just lifted code from different webpages and recombined it like a massively hungover student waking up to realise he&#x27;s supposed to hand in the assignment in one hour.</span>

                              <span>This all has to do with how commercial real estate is valued; rent determines the valuation. If companies are unwilling to pay the rent the space sits empty waiting for a tenant willing to.
The reason for this is if you take lower rent than previously your building value changes and your lenders make you cough up the difference to cover additional principal.
Since the loans come due every 5ish years we’re now seeing buildings unable to justify their previous value, and having to walk away or get valued at their current rent.
It’s going to be ugly for a while.</span>

                              <span>Early 2023, when everyone started using chat GPT for coding, I thought it would be a big boost because it enabled us to quickly employ a large number of people in a project regardless of language or framework.
An year into the project I am forced to revise my opinion. When browsing my code-base I often stumble in abstruse niche solutions for problems that should not have existed. It was clearly the work of someone inexperienced walking through walls in an AI-fuelled coding frenzy.
Having an oracle that knows all answers is useless if you don&#x27;t know what to ask.</span>

                              <span>In my experience, the chairs and how they’re built aren’t what adds to the price tag; the fact that an insurance company is paying is what is.
My daughter literally just got approved for a talking device that would otherwise cost us $4000. It’s a Samsung tablet with $300 software and an attached speaker and comes with some sort of repair agreement. I can buy and break 20 iPads for that price…and we did end up buying one with the software on its own.
If you want to know who’s causing waste, look to the ones who stand to benefit from it.</span>

                              <span>Related, there are a few cryptocurrencies that used things related to finding large primes as part of their proof of work functions. It turns out that ~8 years ago, a really fast primality test implementation could make you a lot of money. (For some period of time I was the author and maintainer of mining software for riecoin. Why, I have no idea, except that I like prime numbers.)
This article omits the number one optimization for fast primality testing: Montgomery multiplication
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplic...
It forms the basis of fast practical modular exponentiation implementations.
Niall Emmart, then in academia and now I believe at Nvidia, released a really, spectacularly fast GPU bigint library, CGBN: https://github.com/NVlabs/CGBN
It&#x27;s still the fastest batch modexp implentation that I&#x27;m aware of. It&#x27;s breathtaking, if I can gush in geek for a moment.
(Someday I should write up the story of how that helped me dominate production of a small cryptocurrency for about 5 years. Thanks, Niall - owe you a beer if we ever cross paths!)
Also worth noting that python includes an entirely fine modexp in the three-argument form of pow(x, y, m) --&gt; compute x^y % m
With that, you can very easily implement a fermat or miller-rabin primality test if you want to roll your own, which is quite fun. If you don&#x27;t, the gmp library provides a very nice mpz_probab_prime() function. Gmp is obviously faster, but it&#x27;s hard to beat the fun of a two liner fermat test for playing with big primes.</span>

This and the non-availability of replacement parts is why some wheelchair users started a project to open-source a wheelchair from standard parts:

                              <span>I was a karate practitioner and instructor in my youth.  Board breaking is really, really easy. The key is the boards designed for breaking are cut in their weakest orientation.  Wood is incredibly strong going with the fibers, even a pine board is very hard to break long ways using a sledge hammer.  However, if it&#x27;s cut on its short axis, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to break.  Most people, even children don&#x27;t need any guidance beyond, &quot;punch through the board&quot; to be successful.  Breaking boards is more mental than physical.  If a student is struggling or a novice, the person holding the board can hold their hands a little wider to make it easier to break.
Concrete is more difficult, but there&#x27;s still a trick to it.  The blocks you use for breaking have a bit of flex to them, but are also extremely brittle.  So just getting it to flex just a small amount will cause them to break in half.  That&#x27;s also why you place spacers between stacks of bricks or wood.  You&#x27;re leveraging the flex of the material to break it, and stacking them without spacers makes too rigid to break.
In short, this stuff is 90% magic trick.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m all for moving to higher-level skills, when I was an adjunct professor I usually didn&#x27;t put a huge emphasis on syntax unless I thought it was important to explain a concept, and I very rarely took off points for syntax.
That said, I don&#x27;t know that I would allow AI for learning to code in the class.  I do not consider &quot;prompt engineering&quot; to be a substitute for programming, and it&#x27;s very easy to get AI to write some code and copypaste it, not understand anything it said, and be done.
Last year, when I was administering a test, I said that they were allowed to use any IDE they wanted, but they could not use any AI assistance.  I am pretty convinced one student just copypasted my test questions into ChatGPT or BingAI and then copied the answers. I didn&#x27;t have a way to prove it so I had to give him the benefit of the doubt and grade it assuming he did it honestly.
Before someone says &quot;YOU SHOULD TEACH THEM TO USE THE AI TOOLS LOL THAT&#x27;S THE FUTURE!!!&quot;, stop.  That&#x27;s not true, not yet at least.  Just because I can call an Uber doesn&#x27;t mean I get to say I know how to drive.  Just because I can go to McDonalds doesn&#x27;t mean I get to say I know how to cook. I was teaching them how to write Java and Python, the goal of the class was for them to learn Java and Python, it wasn&#x27;t learning how to copypaste into OpenAI.</span>

                              <span>We’re undergoing a Cambrian explosion of battery chemistries at the moment. Other startups, such as From Energy is scaling up production of Iron Air batteries in West Virginia, which will be an order of magnitude cheaper than lithium ion and will provide grid scale power [1]. North Harbour Clean Energy Promised to build a manufacturing facility in Australia to build Vanadium Flow batteries, which have very high charge cycle in their lifetime and can store energy for longer durations [2].
The advantage with Sodium Ion is that, although energy densities are lower than Lithium Ion, it could still be used to power mobile devices and electric vehicles.

                              <span>As a person that used to be a “human scribe” but for emergency dept doctors. I would say the ER doctors shared the same experience as the one depicted in the news story. For a doctor that was nearing the age of retirement or had very poor keyboard proficiency. scribes were a godsend.
Doctors worried less about documentation and focused more on patient care. Of course they still wrote things like admission orders, prescriptions, and nurse orders. Scribes were often told to avoid doing these but sometimes the doctor was okay with it. I personally just told them to do it. Too much of a legal liability for both of parties.
But capturing all of the details of the history of present illness (HPI), patient medical history, review of systems, physical exam, procedures (if any) and medical decision making during patient visit can be a time consuming issue. Time increases with significantly more complex cases, especially one with more than one procedure.
Documenting it so that it can be billed appropriately is also crucial.
Prior to scribes, doctors would describe forgoing writing documentation all together at the end of the shift and writing it the next day or shift.
Obviously, this caused very poor documentation and opened up the doctor to legal issues (if they arise). Ambulance chasers can easily call out these inconsistent details between doctor notes, patient outcomes, and cross check with nursing notes.
Additionally, this caused cases to be billed incorrectly or “down coded” as well.
I don’t agree with allowing private companies unfettered/unregulated access to what is considered private medical information. But with appropriate controls on the data and who has access to it with full transparency, I think it can help in alleviating physical burn out.</span>

I worked at a bar when I was young, listened to the stories; the most annoying protobuf deserialization issues or &#x27;Agile meetings&#x27; are freaking fun compared to the most of the stories you can hear.
This is just comparing apples to oranges. Woodworking or any other hobby that you enjoy will be more pleasing than any real job you will do. Programming is fun, that is why you started doing it. Working as software developer can be less so.</span>

Most big companies are not good if you want to solve problems and build stuff. Especially &quot;the enterprise&quot;, where software is seen as a cost center so the less of it the better. The effort of managing up eats a creative person&#x27;s soul.
I want the clarity of being able to talk to &quot;the boss/the customer&quot; and solve their problems and get paid the market rate for my skills. Not prepare endless PowerPoints for my skip-level, who has no ownership but has to act in their own best interests in a swamp of principal-agent problems.
This is why I am very happy at a fast-growing small tech company where one can have honest conversations about the customer and the product. How do other people deal with this?</span>

                              <span>Some of my peers are deep into running. I don’t get it. Running is sometimes fun for me but most often painful.
Then I overheard one of them (the fittest) say to a budding runner that he [should] do mostly easy sessions. Okay what’s easy to him? He said that so slow that it can feel awkward and unnatural. What?
Then I searched around and found out about Zone 2 and how you should do most of your work in that zone when building aerobic fitness. And that it is characterized by being able to hold a conversation, although strained.
I searched around and found atheletes like amateur ultrarunners say the same thing.
Then it hit me. I’ve probably been jogging a lot in Zone 3. Or higher? Because the harder you go the more benefit, right? That seems to be the basic logic for everything.[1] Relatively short, painful sessions. Have I been conditioning myself to associate cardio with more pain than is necessary for the average session?
So maybe I should just go on the stationary bike today, do a “conversatitional” (talk to myself) pace and listen to my audiobook for an hour? And try to not let my groin fall asleep.

                              <span>You receive a call on your phone. The caller says they&#x27;re from your bank. You hang up and call back to the bank yourself. End of story. If the caller objects to you doing that, that by itself is an enormous red flag. You never, EVER take incoming calls from &quot;your bank&quot; seriously.
I myself have an additional rule that I always reject calls from unknown numbers, unless I expect one (delivery, taxi, etc).</span>

I was pushing him in the stroller while he was napping, and at the orangutan exhibit, one came up to the window and gestured towards the stroller.

                              <span>The increasing dominance of large firms in the United States has raised concerns about pricing power in the product market. The worry is that large firms, facing fewer competitors, could increase their markups over marginal costs without fear of losing market share. In a recently published paper, we show that although sales of domestic firms have become more concentrated in the manufacturing sector, this development has been accompanied by the entry and growth of foreign firms. Import competition has lowered U.S. producers’ share of the U.S. market and put smaller, less efficient domestic firms out of business.  Overall, market concentration in manufacturing was stable in recent decades, though import penetration has greatly altered the makeup of the U.S. manufacturing sector.</span>

                              <span>As Israel began its genocide in Gaza, those who manage U.S. colleges and universities also commenced to issue statements of outrage at what Hamas had done. And as campus protests erupted in condemnation of the slaughter of Gazans, and especially children, and the destruction of homes and every major institution, including hospitals, these same institutions of higher learning began to disrupt these protests and bring them to an end. As a former college teacher, one who witnessed the attacks on those who protested against the War in Vietnam and who studied the repression on campuses during the McCarthy period, I became so appalled at what was being done to our brave and courageous college students that I began to write letters to the leaders of what are, in reality, academic enterprises.

A world of massive inequality, increasing existential threat, and a misery index on the rise. To bring about something radically different for humankind would be to address the violence inherent to settler colonialism and, in a clear-eyed manner, address the very much ongoing philosophy that the deranged ruling elite have decided is worth continuing at the cost of the vast majority of humanity.

Hopefully everyone knows this here, but if you paid for an introduction it&#x27;s a negative signal: just cold email.
That being said, I&#x27;ll make intros for only $6,500 and no warrants.</span>

                              <span>Increasingly I think the financialization of everything makes us less capable of understanding the world.
&quot;Red Lobster failed because of X corporate restructuring,&quot; &quot;Red Lobster succeeded due to Y ad campaign.&quot; People go to restaurants for reasons completely unrelated to things like that. Those things are important, but just constitute the small slice of reality that can easily be measured.
I saw a Twitter thread arguing how the video game Stardew Valley succeeded due to the way it was marketed. Marketing is important, but maybe the game succeeded because it was cute and had a soul and is fun to play. You can&#x27;t measure that.</span>

                              <span>I would encourage not directly using the user-uploaded images. But uploading directly to S3 is probably fine. I just wouldn&#x27;t use the raw file.
1. Re-encoding the image is a good idea to make it harder to distribute exploits. For example imaging the recent WebP vulnerability. A malicious user could upload a compromised image as their profile picture and pwn anyone who saw that image in the app. There is a chance that the image survives the re-encoding but it is much less likely and at the very least makes your app not the easiest channel to distribute it.
2. It gives a good place to strip metadata. For example you should almost certianlly be stripping geo location. But in general I would recommend stripping everything non-essential.
3. Generating different sizes as you mentioned can be useful.
4. Allows accepting a variety of formats without requiring consumers to support them all. As you just transcode in one place.
I don&#x27;t know much about the cost on the AWS side, but it seems like you are always at some sort of risk given that if the user knows the bucket name they can create infinite billable requests. Can you create a size limit on the pre-signed URL? That would be a basic line of defence. But you probably also want to validate once the URL expires the data uploaded and decide if it conforms to your expectations (and delete it if you aren&#x27;t interested in preserving the original data).</span>

                              <span>To me this is not even slightly surprising. Red Lobster used to be at the top of our list of restaurants. Then in recent years the quality of both the food and service deteriorated. One visit the food was so bad I couldn&#x27;t even eat it. That was compounded by not having a server to talk to. Took our order and never returned - even had someone else bring out the order.
The thing about a restaurant is that you&#x27;ll always have business if the food and service are good. You can talk about how the market changed or whatever, but no restaurant can survive at that price point while offering so little.
We had a chain BBQ restaurant in town that had a booming business for more than a decade. Then the quality of the food went downhill and they shut down, citing lack of a market. They had a market for years but there&#x27;s no market for crap. Red Lobster&#x27;s situation is no different.</span>

                              <span>With the release of Kubernetes 1.30, the feature to prevent the modification of the volume mode
of a PersistentVolumeClaim that was created from
an existing VolumeSnapshot in a Kubernetes cluster, has moved to GA!
The problem
The Volume Mode of a PersistentVolumeClaim
refers to whether the underlying volume on the storage device is formatted into a filesystem or
presented as a raw block device to the Pod that uses it.
Users can leverage the VolumeSnapshot feature, which has been stable since Kubernetes v1.20,
to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (shortened as PVC) from an existing VolumeSnapshot in
the Kubernetes cluster. The PVC spec includes a dataSource field, which can point to an
existing VolumeSnapshot instance.

The nation&#x27;s economic growth over the past 30 years —one of the fastest in the world—also makes the elections noteworthy on a global scale.

Today&#x27;s article is about authentication: finding out who&#x27;s performing a task, and checking

As expected, there were no changes to the neoliberal policies promoted and imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions. A demonstration was held in front of the headquarters of the two institutions, and the present call to put an end to austerity policies was delivered.

If you have already heard about ValidatingAdmissionPolicies and you are eager to try them out,

Example admission webhook
First, let&#x27;s take a look at an example of a simple webhook. Here is an excerpt from a webhook that

                              <span>Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since the beginning.
Surprisingly, read-only mounts are not completely read-only under certain conditions on Linux.
As of the v1.30 release, they can be made completely read-only,
with alpha support for recursive read-only mounts.
Read-only volume mounts are not really read-only by default
Volume mounts can be deceptively complicated.
You might expect that the following manifest makes everything under /mnt in the containers read-only:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: mnt
 hostPath:
 path: /mnt
 containers:
 - volumeMounts:
 - name: mnt
 mountPath: /mnt
 readOnly: true


However, any sub-mounts beneath /mnt may still be writable!
For example, consider that /mnt/my-nfs-server is writeable on the host.

example, a typical Kubernetes pod runs within a network namespace to isolate the
network identity and a PID namespace to isolate the processes.
One Linux namespace that was left behind is the user
namespace. This
namespace allows us to isolate the user and group identifiers (UIDs and GIDs) we
use inside the container from the ones on the host.
This is a powerful abstraction that allows us to run containers as &quot;root&quot;: we
are root inside the container and can do everything root can inside the pod,
but our interactions with the host are limited to what a non-privileged user can
do. This is great for limiting the impact of a container breakout.

                              <span>As the Great Financial Crisis and associated recession were unfolding in 2009, researchers at the New York Fed joined colleagues at the Board of Governors and Philadelphia Fed to create a new kind of data set. Household liabilities, particularly mortgages, had gone from being a quiet little corner of the financial system to the center of the worst financial crisis and sharpest recession in decades. The new data set was designed to provide fresh insights into this part of the economy, especially the behavior of mortgage borrowers. In the fifteen years since that effort came to fruition, the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) has provided many valuable insights into household behavior and its implications for the macro economy and financial stability. 
The CCP was one of the first data sets drawn from credit bureau data, one of the earliest features of the Center for Microeconomic Data (CMD), and the primary source material for some of the CMD’s most important contributions to policy and research. Here we review a few of the main household debt themes over the past fifteen years, and how our analyses contributed to their understanding.</span>

                              <span>In March of 2023, the U.S. banking industry experienced a period of significant turmoil involving runs on several banks and heightened concerns about contagion. While many factors contributed to these events—including poor risk management, lapses in firm governance, outsized exposures to interest rate risk, and unrecognized vulnerabilities from interconnected depositor bases, the role of bank supervisors came under particular scrutiny. Questions were raised about why supervisors did not intervene more forcefully before problems arose. In response, supervisory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, commissioned reviews that examined how supervisors’ actions might have contributed to, or mitigated, the failures. The reviews highlighted the important role that bank supervisors can play in fostering a stable banking system. In this post, we draw on our recent paper providing a critical review and summary of the empirical and theoretical literature on bank supervision to highlight what that literature tells us about the impact of supervision on supervised banks, on the banking industry and on the broader economy.</span>

In this post, which is based on a related staff report, we analyze the supply chain reconfiguration and associated financial and real effects following the imposition of export controls by the U.S. government.</span>

                              <span>As shown in a past Liberty Street Economics post, in the United States, the yields of money market fund (MMF) shares respond to changes in monetary policy rates much more than the rates of bank deposits; in other words, the MMF beta is much higher than the deposit beta. Consistent with this, the size of the U.S. MMF industry fluctuates over the interest rate cycle, expanding during times of monetary policy tightening. In this post, we show that the relationship between the policy rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the size of European MMFs investing in euro-denominated securities is also positive—as long as policy rates are positive; after the ECB introduced negative policy rates in 2015, that relationship broke down, as MMFs received large inflows during this period.</span>

Introducing the Code Organization subproject
Frederico (FSM): Hello Madhav, thank you for your availability. Could you start by telling us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes?

                              <span>Following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the stock prices of U.S banks fell amid concerns about the exposure of the banking sector to interest rate risk. Thus, between March 8 and March 15, 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Bank index dropped 12.8 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns (see right panel of the chart below). The stock prices of insurance companies tumbled as well, with the S&amp;P 500 Insurance index losing 6.4 percent relative to S&amp;P 500 returns over the same time interval (see the center panel below). Yet, insurance companies’ direct exposure to the three failed banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, and Signature Bank) through debt and equity was modest. In this post, we examine the possible factors behind the reaction of insurance investors to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</span>

                              <span>A classic question for U.S. financial firms is whether to organize themselves as entities that are affiliated with a bank-holding company (BHC). This affiliation brings benefits, such as access to liquidity from other affiliated entities, as well as costs, particularly a larger regulatory burden. This post highlights the results from a recent Staff Report that sheds light on this tradeoff. This work uses confidential data on the population of broker-dealers to study the benefits of being affiliated with a BHC, with a focus on the global financial crisis (GFC). The analysis reveals that affiliation with a BHC makes broker-dealers more resilient to the aggregate liquidity shocks that prevailed during the GFC. This results in these broker-dealers being more willing to hold riskier securities on their balance sheet relative to broker-dealers that are not affiliated with a BHC.</span>
