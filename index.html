                              <span>NATO’s Washington Declaration contains a section that is puzzling. It says that China “has become a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine.” The term “decisive enabler” has attracted significant attention within China, where the government immediately condemned NATO’s characterization of the war in Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that NATO’s statement “is ill-motivated and makes no sense.” Shortly after Russian troops entered Ukraine, China’s Wang Wenbin of the Foreign Ministry said that “all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and upheld.” This is precisely the opposite of cheerleading for the war.

Crimes against humanity now become fodder for video games and the Hollywood disimagination machine.  All of which creates an ecology of cruelty and sadism that promotes a “symbiosis of suffering and spectacle.” More

The failure of Israel’s two most important allies, the US and UK, to put an end to the slaughter of the civilian population in Gaza in 2023-2024 and the American and British mainstream media’s refusal to contextualize the 7 October attack raises questions about their status as democratic states. What many independent journalists and academics have described as Israel’s genocidal policy in Gaza has a parallel in America’s “Indian removal” policies in the 19th century and British colonialism in India, where violent imperial rule brought about tens of millions of excess deaths between 1880 and 1920 (Sullivan &amp; Hickel, 2022). The racist underpinnings of settler colonialism have thus been present in Western, specifically Judeo-Christian, political culture since Europeans first explored continents beyond their own. Modern day Zionism is a retrograde form of colonialism and imperialism that is rooted in 19th-century nationalist, militarist, capital-expansionist, and racist practices and outlooks of Western Europe from which it sprung.

                              <span>I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It&#x27;s a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.
Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let&#x27;s call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There&#x27;s more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it&#x27;s completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.

                              <span>I got my commuter card in the mail this week from work, and today I used it for the first time! I was so excited about it I even texted my friend. It&#x27;s a silly thing to be excited about, considering that it&#x27;s literally just a Visa prepaid debit card with my own money on it, the only benefit being I&#x27;m not taxed for money put on that debit card. But it still makes me happy, for reasons besides the few hundred dollars it&#x27;ll save me in taxes that I cannot explain. (Maybe it makes me feel like the Responsible Independent Adult in the city that I always wanted to be.)
Back in college my friends and I would do things like leave amusement parks early to grocery shop and make healthy dinners together back at home. We&#x27;re turning into our parents, we&#x27;d say, laughing, the irony of a bunch of teenagers…</span>

                              <span>Pour bien commencer ce blog, je vais faire un article égocentrique.
J&#x27;espère que parmi celles et ceux qui le liront,
il y aura quand même 2-3 &quot;pélo&quot; qui arriveront à s&#x27;identifier à mon ressenti.
Ces dernières années, j&#x27;ai mené de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle.
Mais j&#x27;ai souvent été déçu.
Elles n&#x27;avaient pourtant pas de problèmes intrinsèques.
J&#x27;entends par là qu&#x27;a priori, je crois que les joueurs s&#x27;amusaient.
Je pense d&#x27;ailleurs que je m&#x27;amusais aussi durant la partie.
Bien sûr, tout n&#x27;était pas mémorable, tout ne se valait pas,
il y a eu des bonnes et des mauvaises rencontres,
mais j&#x27;estime que ces parties n&#x27;étaient pas &quot;mauvaises&quot;.
La déception dont je parle est plus personnelle.
Et elle va plus loin que la partie en tant que telle.
Pour comprendre cela, il faut se pencher sur la r…</span>

The International Court of Justice has made definitive what has been obvious for decades: It’s about the apartheid, stupid. In a sweeping ruling announced on Friday at the Hague, the Court ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories violates international law and should be ended. It determined that the occupation amounts to “annexation” of Palestinian lands and that all Israeli settlements should be evacuated and the land returned to Palestinians. It said that all Palestinians who had been forced into exile should be granted the right to return and that Israel must pay them reparations for its destructive actions. The court described Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories as a form of racial segregation and apartheid and called for the dismantling of the apartheid wall, checkpoints and other barriers to travel.

                              <span>Trump&#x27;s would-be assassin, Crooks didn’t seem overtly political. His politics were the politics of the gun. He searched for the names of Biden and Trump, equally, it seemed and was likely to have pulled the trigger on the first one who entered the sights of his AR-15. There was just a dime’s worth of difference between them as far as he was concerned. Crooks is the next variation on Kyle Rittenhouse, a fucked up white kid, working a dead-end job in a shabbily run nursing home, who ventured forth bound for glory with a semi-automatic rifle in the Republic of the Shooter.

They revolted against it in stupendously high numbers in the 1960s and ‘70s, but the intellectual heavyweights in the House of Representatives idiotically brushed off that bit of relevant history with their odious vote June 14 to facilitate reinstatement of conscription. With any luck, they’ll reap the whirlwind they deserve.  More

This article outlines some planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.31 release that the release team feels you should be aware of for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment.
The information listed below is based on the current status of the v1.31 release.
It may change before the actual release date.
The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features.
This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level.

                              <span>Earlier this month, I wrote a blog post titled “To Blogroll, or to not?” With my thought process of not adding a Blogroll to my page, but opting to add a Postroll instead. Since that post went live, I have gotten replies from both ends of the spectrum agreeing and (respectfully) disagreeing with my thought process. I’ve highlighted some of those responses at the bottom of the post under the 💬 Community Echoes, if you were curious.
Anyways, this got me really thinking about Discovery and Community, especially since I’m seeing a few articles written ranging from “WTF Happened to Blogs” to “indie blogs are doing OK: here’s how to find them”. I wanted a way to contribute to the blogging community, which has made me feel immensely welcomed since I rejoined at the end of March.
So here we go…

i&#x27;m quitting my part-time job next week. 

is it okay to be unemployed at 26? 

i think it&#x27;s mainly because i don&#x27;t like where i am right now. 

when i was a kid i picked up on things very quickly. 

i know (i hope) i won&#x27;t be stuck here forever. 

i&#x27;m still struggling, and even if i tell myself and others that there is no such thing as being behind, i can&#x27;t help but feel dissatisfied with my current situation. 

i&#x27;m trying to have faith in myself but i&#x27;m not so good on my own, so please put your faith in me as well. 
and hope with me that this too shall pass.</span>

-One of my favorite hobbies used to be reading books. Now, it feels impossible to read one page without having to backtrack and read that page again (and sometimes...again) because I have no idea what I just read. My mind is unable to keep focus. I buy a lot of books, but I don&#x27;t read them. I&#x27;m a collector of nightstand-books.
-I started eating Kimchi for the first time ever this week and...I&#x27;m in love.
-A part of me wants to remove my blog archives page from the navigation, create a new page, and showcase only the posts I want to keep sharing. idk.
-Dating someone new is hard. Constantly making sure you&#x27;re shaved, smelling wonderful, hair at its best, face presentable, worried about farting in front of them or taking a shit in your own bathroom, making sure you&#x27;re wearing sexy underwear, not eating too much in front of them...honestly, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m afraid of being human. I just want to be a slob on my couch sometimes.
-Do you use Are.na? I want to, but it looks awful. I downloaded Cosmos, and I do like it so far. I wonder if there are any other apps similar to Are.na (not Pinterest).
-I sent out my weekly letter yesterday. Did you read it? I love writing these tiny missives through email. Are people reading it though? I don&#x27;t know. But I shall keep writing and sharing, and hopefully, it will help someone out there feel a little less alone.</span>

                              <span>It all started with a post on my main blog where I still have the urge to revisit the art of learning software and web tools. Even if they are small things, I want to learn basics again other than simply editing templates or static site generators. I&#x27;ll keep my main blog for everything else I want to share, but I had to buy-yet-another-domain as a nudge to see if I can seperate this tech space online. I also hope to actually put it on a resume one day.
I want to focus on fun projects that I might use, such as learning how to create a discord bot, a Twitch bot or overlay, or other tools that I&#x27;ll use for my current hobbies. I think a to do list of sorts that I come back to now and again is a good start.

I&#x27;ve read your post a life lived diligently, and it made me want to write to you.
When I was younger, I dreamed every day of becoming a product designer. I had convinced myself I was going to go study abroad, become self-employed, and the riches and fame would be mine.
poor, depressed artist aesthetic, after which I would be discovered and prove everyone wrong about not chasing your dreams. My peers would see me on TV and gawk. Grand finale: let the curtain fall; everyone applauds.
I&#x27;m happy to say none of that came true.
The truth is, your 20s are a little bit of a bitch. These are the years someone can either be going steady with a child on each hip or they can be partying &#x27;til the sun goes down. Comparison is hard to keep at bay since everyone is going at a different pace and …</span>

                              <span>Despite the existing safety net, worker displacement continues to have severe consequences that motivate the consideration of new social insurance programs. Wage insurance is a novel policy that temporarily provides additional income to workers who lose their job and become re-employed at a lower wage. In this post, we draw on evidence from our recent working paper analyzing the effects of a U.S. wage insurance program on worker earnings and employment outcomes. Among workers displaced by international trade, we find that eligibility for wage insurance increased the probability of employment in the first two years following job loss and led to higher long-term earnings. The program resulted in net savings to the government because workers collected fewer benefits and paid taxes on their increased earnings. Together, these findings suggest that wage insurance could support displaced workers more effectively than traditional social insurance programs.</span>

Introduction
TO BEGIN...
 “We recognize that the feminist camp has made great efforts, by revealing the mechanisms that oppress women and dissidence, and by naming issues that used to be invisible. However, this does not mean that the concepts and categories, and therefore the theoretical frameworks, are all equally valid. As especifist anarchists we task ourselves with taking from these theoretical productions, the concepts and categories that are consistent with our own ideology. Referring to the guiding principles of other currents will not only lead us down a different ideological path but also have concrete effects on the militancy, on the political level as on the …</span>

 It was Autumn. A carriage and a calesche were proceeding at a sharp trot along the high-road. In the carriage sat two women. One of them was the mistress, thin and pale. The other was the maid, smug, florid, and buxom. Her short dry tresses peeped forth from under her faded bonnet, her pretty hand in her torn glove readjusted them from time to time; her swelling bosom, covered by a rug, was full of the breath of health; her quick black eyes glanced at one moment out of the window at the scurrying fields, at another stared boldly at her mistress, or glanced uneasily at the corners of the carriage.

 Most of what comes out in the text “Addicted to Losing” is not new. Black anarchists and anti-authoritarians have been critiquing black non-profits, Black academics, Black activists and black authoritarians for years before the 2020 uprising. Black anarchists who have been active PRIOR to 2020 have been deeply aware of these critiques, mainly based on their experiences. We are unsure how connected the author is to Black anti-authoritarians but, best believe Black anarchists been having these conversations. There has been so much ta…</span>

 For most of the 20th century, all mainstream political parties in Western Europe coalesced around the idea that, ultimately, the state should be the chief provider of social welfare and instrument of social reform.

This has culminated in attacks on the direct provision of welfare by the state in…</span>

 Why? 
 Because I’m mad that they wasted my time with their awful presentation/book-report/thinly-veiled-business-management-double-speak that tried to sell me and a bunch of other anarchists a program of non-violent civil disobedience to stop the police training facility from being constructed in the Old Prison Farm.

___________

Yesterday, when I woke up to go for work. I always take a shower &amp; change cloths.
I was half sleep ironing my pant &amp; shirt while yawning . Then, I went to bathroom to put my cloth on the hooks.
The bathroom door look like this ( I kinda trying my hand at pixel art)

Then I remember, I forgot to bring my towel. I went to get my towel and as I was putting the towel on the hook. I saw Grasshopper sitting on that hook .
My half sleep state was gone. My brain got in a panic mood, I cant move a muscle or scream. I knew if I did that it will fly and I dont want it to sit on me or near me. I slowly move one step at a time. Then, I slowly put my cloth and swiftly run from the bathroom after opening my door.
My grandma saw me shooting like a meteoroid from a bathroom. She worriedly inquired: is everything ok?
I told her that I saw grasshopper sitting on the door hook. My brother over heard my story as he was ironing cloth from a different room. I asked should I let it flew away or kill it by hitting with besom. He said smash the grasshopper with the besom.
I cant even say to my bro do it for me. :( Then with a bit of courage, I take a besom in my hand and went to a fight a ferocious battle for a noble cause  of disturbing my morning bath (hahha).
I was successful in my first strike but he was alive. He start to move that scared the shit out of me. After some more awful hitting it besom he died.
I felt both awful for killing it but cant have it flying it over my head or in my cloth. I even shudder just thinking about this event.

                              <span>This post is inspired by Misha’s post a life lived diligently.
I started playing the piano when I was five. My first dream was to be a concert pianist like Lang Lang. I was drawn to the glitz and glamor of playing in cavernous concert halls to people in suits sitting on red velvet chairs. I let go of that dream a few years later when it became painfully apparent that I lacked both the talent and the dedication to fulfill it.
For a brief period after, I settled on a more realistic goal — playing the viola in a symphony orchestra. There were more orchestras than world-famous concert pianists, after all, and less violists than pianists to go around. I thought it a nice compromise between my childhood fantasies and reality.

i started doing a lot of new things recently.
getting back into kpop
using actives in my skincare routine to curb my adult acne
mat pilates at home (i’ve been trying to do them daily, but it’s hard. some days just feel harder than others)
trying to lose weight healthily (a point proven difficult by my bulimia that’s graduated to restrictive eating (i barely have any full meals))
watching new kdrama to fill up my empty days
about the last point: i recently watched because this is my first life. in the show, we meet ji-ho, a 30 something who gave up on her dream to …</span>

                              <span>The consumer price index for groceries has risen more than the overall price index since the start of the pandemic, with a particularly large jump in 2022. In looking for explanations, a starting place is the behavior of raw commodity prices, which surged from early 2021 to mid-2022. In addition, wages for low-paid grocery workers have gone up faster than wages for the workforce as a whole. Finally, even though profit margins for grocery stores have gone up, the increase appears to be only a small contributor to the rise in food prices relative to the increase in their operating costs. This analysis suggests that the significant moderation in food inflation since the start of 2023 is due to still-high wage inflation for grocery workers being offset by the retreat in commodity prices.</span>

Title: What is the Proletariat?

 In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Manifesto of the Communist Party. It famously ends by declaring, “let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. Proletarians have nothing to lose in it but their chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries unite!” (Marx and Engels 1996, 30). The word proletariat continues to be used by socialists and communists today. This does not mean that the word is widely understood.
