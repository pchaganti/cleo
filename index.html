1. Go to cancel your subscription. You will see a screen with the cancellation fee. Continue.
2. They will offer you a new plan to avoid the cancellation fee. Choose the cheapest one to switch to a new plan.
3. Here&#x27;s the loophole: You can cancel any plan for free within two weeks. Cancel the new plan within this period and get your money back for the first month of the new plan.

                              <span>Not the submitter, but I installed this a couple days ago to replace Bartender. For those not following along at home, the Bartender author just sold it to some sketchy app mill. It’s an app that legitimately requires screen recording permissions to work. I trusted the old author’s reputation. I have zero trust in the own owner.
Ice isn’t as good yet. It’s not nearly so configurable. For example, you can either hide all icons or none. You can’t decide to show some of them all the time. That’s a bummer. I’ll still happily accept that trade off to replace Bartender, which I’d previously purchased several versions of. It’s dead to me.
Great job so far, Ice. I hope you keep improving!</span>

Even by 1990, it had become clear that the migrants had become an essential force in providing foreign exchange to their countries through increasing remittance payments to their families. By 2015, remittances—mostly by the international working class—outstripped the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by three times and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). ODA is the aid money provided by states, whereas FDI is the investment money provided by private companies. For some countries, such as Mexico and the Philippines, remittance payments from working-class migrants prevented state bankruptcy. More

But I am pointing out that while New York State court has jurisdiction over convicted felon Trump, the judge has both the right and the obligation—before issuing a sentence—to find out if the defendant has understood the charges that were brought against him. (From his endless press conferences during his trials, Trump sounds clueless about the facts in his own cases.) More

                              <span>The problem may have more to do with Uganda and having a surveillance state than it has to do with National ID cards.
Most European countries have them and they are as uncontroversial as passports.
Countries without national ID cards are not especially more privacy minded : for the purpose of identity verification they just use alternative documents &amp; processes that are less straightforward and at least as intrusive (e.g. driving licenses, utility bills and credit checks in the US and UK).
IMO it&#x27;s much more honest to recognize that there&#x27;s a legitimate need to be able to prove one&#x27;s identity in a functioning society, and to build a dedicated system for that, instead of tying your existence as a citizen to your ability / willingness to drive a large piece of metal around.</span>

&quot;We currently don&#x27;t understand how to make sense of the neural activity within language models.&quot;
&quot;Unlike with most human creations, we don’t really understand the inner workings of neural networks.&quot;
&quot;The [..] networks are not well understood and cannot be easily decomposed into identifiable parts&quot;
&quot;[..] the neural activations inside a language model activate with unpredictable patterns, seemingly representing many concepts simultaneously&quot;
&quot;Learning a large number of sparse features is challenging, and past work has not been shown to scale well.&quot;
etc., etc., etc.
People say we don&#x27;t (currently) know why they output what they output, because .. as the article clearly states, we don&#x27;t.</span>

                              <span>I think there are qualitative differences that arise from incremental, quantitative changes in privacy.
Sure, in the 1970s the cops could follow you around any time you were out in public. But they needed 6+ cops to provide round-the-clock surveillance, with an annual cost in the high six figures.
So the average citizen&#x27;s privacy was protected not by law or high-minded ideals about privacy, but by simple numbers. There weren&#x27;t enough cops to follow even 0.1% of the population.
But in the modern age of smartphones and license plate recognition and credit reference agencies? I think there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that we need new laws and new rights to reflect the new reality, where tracking people around the clock is several orders of magnitude cheaper.</span>

The announcers laughing about the ship being &quot;maybe held together by some nuts and bolts&quot; and then it still pulled off the fucking landing burn!

Living in central Florida I cannot wait for the new launch facility to come online. We&#x27;re going to have lines of spectators into the space coast like we did for the shuttle.
If any of you are heading to Disney World you should stop by the NASA Kennedy Visitor Complex, it is so well done and not that expensive (it takes less time than 1 line at Disney world to get to :) ). It has the original launch control room for Apollo that you can tour, a Saturn V rocket that is laid horizontally and you can walk under, the crew module for the moon landing.  My favorite part is the Atlantis shuttle suspended from the ceiling, they left it in its &quot;raw&quot; landed format with scorch marks and tiles, it looks absolutely amazing.</span>

                              <span>I live in Spain and own property in Spain. There&#x27;s clearly a gap between imaginary noble okupas addressing housing crisis via occupation of unused bank property and reality of weed smoking anarchists and their collaborating deoccupying mafia harassing mostly not-so-rich middle class, who can&#x27;t afford the security measures the rich can. It&#x27;s not a small problem, there&#x27;s like 12K cases per year last time I checked. Everybody knows the problem exists, most people take extra, otherwise not necessary measures against it. The leftist govt adds to the problem somehow rationalizing it and trying to channel poor&#x27;s frustration onto middle-class, while the actual abusers, who are well aware of the problem, stay safe.</span>

What you describe is a feature of a high-trust society, where you don&#x27;t have to double-check every single transaction or interaction you enter into, but can take most statements on trust. This allows people to get on with the fundamental task at hand, rather than dealing with the overhead of checking their food in the chemistry lab, or whatever the equivalent is for the specific transaction.
I have read suggestions that this was a major contributor to the growth of the Western economies, relative to other low-trust societies. If this was the case, we are in for a bumpy ride, as we seem to be rapidly changing from a high-trust to a low-trust society.</span>

                              <span>Trying to understand consumer privacy behaviors outside the prevalent social contract that the vast majority of people operate under is bound to missinterpret what is happening and why.
We live in a regulated &quot;supermarket&quot; economy. What surfaces on a screen is entirely analogous to what surfaces on a shelf: People check the price and make their choices based on taste, budget etc. They are not idiots, they operate under a simplifying assumption that makes life in a complex world possible.
The implicit assumption central to this way of organising the economy is that anything legally on sale is &quot;safe&quot;. That it has been checked and approved by experts that know what they are doing and have the consumer interest as top priority.
People will not rush back home to their chemistry labs to check what is in their purchased food, whether it corresponds to the label (assuming that such a label even exists) and what might be the short or long term health effects. They dont have the knowledge, resources and time to do that for all the stuff they get exposed to.
What has drifted in the digital economy is not consumer standards, it is regulatory standards. Surfacing digital products with questionable short and long term implications for individuals and society has become a lucrative business, has captured its regulatory environment and will keep exploiting opportunities and blind spots until there is pushback.
Ultimately regulators only derive legitimacy from serving their constituencies, but that feedback loop can be very slow and it gets tangled with myriad other unrelated political issues.</span>

                              <span>The thing with monopoly laws is it doesn’t matter how you got into pole position. The point is that you’re illegally utilizing tangential benefits of the pole position to maintain that position as well as enter new markets.
&gt; including how the company’s software locks customers into using its chips, as well as how Nvidia distributes those chips to customers.
The lock-in is probably a losing argument on technical merits unless NVIDIA is doing something nefarious there (which the lawsuit will potentially reveal). If nVidia is distributing chips in preferred ways to partners it wants to succeed (e.g. those partnered with MSFT which it has a very cozy and tight-knit relationship), that could be an anti trust thing.
&gt; Microsoft structured its minority stake in OpenAI in part to avoid antitrust scrutiny, The Times has reported. Microsoft also reached a deal in March to hire most of the staff of Inflection AI, another A.I. start-up, and license its technology. Because the deal was not a standard acquisition, it may be harder for regulators to scrutinize.
So there is an argument to be made that MSFT is acutely self-aware its behavior could be viewed as engaging in antitrust. If there’s a law against structuring financial transactions, why isn’t similar behavior in the business world viewed similarly as trying to bypass the spirit of the law?</span>

                              <span>Nvidia solved a hard problem and their competitors all failed. I spent years with an AMD card growing progressively more annoyed at their self-inflicted apparent inability to multiply matrices on demand. Nvidia had nothing to do with their failure, unless they had some sort of high-level mole in AMD&#x27;s driver teams.
Hitting the only successful company in a difficult field with legal assaults is not the obvious path to success. Nvidia has nothing close to a monopoly; there is no moat and they operate in a commodity space that will behave like a normal competitive market. It just happens that their competitors were wall-to-wall complacent about how quickly the hardware world can change and they stupidly thought graphics cards were for displaying graphics. It turns out graphics cards are for building AI and crypto markets.</span>

                              <span>Well, hello there.
I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to make the move from my former (Notes) blogging platform to Bear blog. I listed out some pros and cons in one of my previous posts1, and I really thought I was going to stay put for a little bit. After all, I wanted to look away from the new and shiny temptation and really think about what it would mean to switch. Moving sucks, and I hate having to pack, and unpack.
Well, I spent the past few days packing, and then unpacking (aka migrating my blog). I figured this was a good way to test out Bear to see if writing in all markdown would bother me. It didn’t. I’m already primarily writing in Markdown on Bear (Notes App) before posting, so there wasn’t much overheard. I found myself enjoying this lightweight yet customizable platform.
So, here I am. Things are a little bit scattered. Still have no idea where to put some of my things. I think it will take some time, but I’m already cozying up in my new home.
If you’re new here, welcome! If you’ve been following me from the beginning, I’m so glad to have you on here. Grab a seat, and enjoy my Notes about anything and everything.
Until then, go read some posts from some awesome bloggers I have listed here for JUnited. They&#x27;re all pretty great!

                              <span>SLS is a jobs program. It&#x27;s not economically viable at over $1 billion per launch.
As for Blue Origin and New Glenn, this is an object lesson that simply throwing money at the problem doesn&#x27;t necessarily solve it. Did you know Blue Origin was founded ~18 months before SpaceX?
For the longest time (up until ~9 months ago), Bezos had the former Honeywell CEO in charge of Blue Origin, which to me was such an odd choice. You see, this guy seems to embody everything wrong with corporate America: he was completely focused on not failing rather than succeeding. So there were constant delays with New Glenn and the BE-4 engine, which is years behind schedule. You can&#x27;t fail if you don&#x27;t launch.
And the new CEO (David Limp) used to be in charge of Kindles.</span>

                              <span>Employers don&#x27;t reward long-term employees because they don&#x27;t need to. Even though everyone knows you make more by job-hopping, companies are following a rational strategy because too few people &quot;walk the walk&quot; despite wanting more salary. Arguably unethical, but rational.
At the cost of losing a minority of job-hoppers they retain the cheap majority that:
    - finds job interviews exhausting, or is anxious about being rejected

    - dislikes conflict or negotiation

    - has good relationships with colleagues they don&#x27;t want to lose

    - has a comfortable commute or WFH arrangement they don&#x27;t want to change

    - is proud of becoming an expert / go-to-person in some part of the business and doesn&#x27;t want to lose that source of social capital

    - is proud of product or service they have made a big contribution to and wants to &quot;see it through to the end&quot;

    - believes leaving would place an unfair burden on other team-members or would be disloyal to a manager they consider a friend

    - (US only) cannot risk losing healthcare

It&#x27;s the same reason why your phone/insurance/whatever provider puts up the prices year-after-year: although some people leave, enough people simply put up with it that they make more money this way. &quot;Do nothing&quot; is an easy choice and companies are banking on enough people making that choice.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always been confused by how these decisions go. Everybody agrees that the user has the right to make a copy, so when the company puts a 
&quot;digital lock&quot; on it, the fight is whether the user has a right to break the lock. But if I have a right to go through my door, and somebody has put a padlock on the door to keep me out, the right question shouldn&#x27;t be whether I&#x27;m allowed to pick the lock, it should be why the padlock is legal.
If customers may legally make a copy of the e-book you sell to them, it should be on you the merchant to ensure customers are able to do so.</span>

                              <span>This is a bit of a tangential rant, so I apologize. But I recently tried to update Death Stranding, the flagship AAA game that Apple landed on macOS and in the App Store. The game itself is 77.5 GB; it had required a little over 150 GB to install. I shrugged that off at the time; they haven&#x27;t figured out how to decompress on the fly, whatever.
I had about 50GB free on my (1 TB M1 Max) machine at the time of the update, and the App Store told me I didn&#x27;t have enough free space to update. I balked and looked at the update description, which was just &quot;Various minor bug fixes.&quot; The update size was...75 GB. They expect me to re-download the entire game for various minor bug fixes.
(I would &quot;just blame the developer&quot; here, but Apple clearly invested a lot into having this game available on macOS, in the App Store, and got Hideo Kojima to show up at WWDC (a full year ago, remember) and brag about how nice the entire experience is. Some of Apple&#x27;s engineers probably worked directly on this port.)
It then sunk in that I didn&#x27;t just need 75 GB of free space. I needed 150 GB. The App Store will completely download and completely decompress the entire game before replacing it. That is the patching process for the game. You need 231 GB free at all times on your machine to have and update a 77GB game.
This is completely insulting given Apple&#x27;s storage prices, and the fact that the App Store does not let you install apps on an external drive.
Apple clearly doesn&#x27;t get it. They act like they&#x27;re nominally putting in the effort, but then it&#x27;s still just completely half-assed even when things are played exactly like they want.</span>

You can add feature requests there, it should be pretty simple to extend BTT to support the remaining required features.
I have also recently been approached by shady companies trying to buy my app (I&#x27;d never do that) - maybe they are currently targeting apps that require special permissions?</span>

                              <span>This is bad advice.
Say I have a user table, and the email is unique and required, and we don’t let users update their email, and we don’t have user deletion. If I’m going natural PK, I make email the primary key.
But … then we add the ability for users to update their email. But it should still be the same user! This is trivial if we have a surrogate primary key, a nightmare if we made email the natural primary key.
Or building on that example, maybe at first we always require an email from our users. But later we also allow phone auth, and you just need an email OR a phone number. And later we add user name auth, SSO, etc. Again, all good with surrogate primary keys, a nightmare with natural primary keys.
There are countless examples like this. You brought up cars, same thing with licence plates, for example. Or even Social Security Numbers/Social Insurance Numbers - in Canada SINs are generally permanent, but temporary residents can have their SIN change if they later become permanent residents, but they’re still the same person.
You want your entities to have stable identity, even if things you at one time thought gave them identity change. Surrogate primary keys do that, natural primary keys do not. Don’t use natural primary keys, use surrogate primary keys with unique constraints/indexes.
I challenge you to come up with a single plausible example where you’re screwing yourself by choosing surrogate PK + unique constraints/indexes. Meanwhile there are endless examples where you’re screwing yourself by choosing natural PK.</span>

first commit
of Kubernetes was pushed to GitHub. That first commit with 250 files and 47,501 lines of go, bash
and markdown kicked off the project we have today. Who could have predicted that 10 years later,
Kubernetes would grow to become one of the largest Open Source projects to date with over
88,000 contributors from
more than 8,000 companies, across
44 countries.
This milestone isn&#x27;t just for Kubernetes but for the Cloud Native ecosystem that blossomed from
it. There are close to 200 projects
within the CNCF itself, with contributions from
240,000+ individual contributors and
thousands more in the greater ecosystem. Kubernetes would not be where it is today without them, the
7M+ Developers,

                              <span>The point of this blog was to put myself out there. Why? I stopped filling my mind with content and the resulting silence led to an outpour of content in my head. I needed an outlet to express the thoughts in my head. Something I cover in my essay on writing here. Also who wants to miss out on being part of the future AGI training set?
Yet I never thought of one huge perk. Attracting like-minded people. The internet is amazing. You put out slivers of your consciousness and watch as like-minded people gather around. I have got DMS asking such specific things. Relating to my essays, to my impact page. People I looked up to on x. People who inspired me. It feels nice to interact with your tribe.
I have already got many people writing and sharing on Twitter. Especially through bearblog. I would urge more people to do the same. Be you. Even if you don&#x27;t get many views. Just share your thoughts. You will attract similar-minded people. Find friends, business partners, and
maybe life partners. That is the hidden perk no one tells you about.
So if you are on the fence, start writing and sharing. Best of luck!</span>

It started with OpenAI and ChatGPT, followed by Humana&#x27;s AI Pin and Rabbit R1 from Rabbit Inc. Neither delivered on their promises, but the Rabbit R1 has an extra touch.
While Humane&#x27;s brooch is just an overpriced product that doesn’t work properly, the Rabbit R1 is a mishmash of poorly executed features and a good dose of scams, especially coming from a company previously involved with NFTs and &quot;pay-to-win&quot; games (which use NFTs).

                              <span>My blog was housed on Scribbles since February, but I recently started playing around with Bear, another Indie Web blogging platform. it offers light customization and uses Markdown — two things I’d really been missing on Scribbles.
Well, here I am — permanently blogging on Bear now. I’ve also changed the name of my blog and have a new domain. It feels a bit like starting over, but not quite because I brought some old posts over with me. I’m certainly looking forward to this new adventure, though.
My old blog is still online and still available to visit, if anyone has an inkling to do so. I’m also not leaving the Scribbles platform entirely. My Camp Snap Chronicle photo blog will still remain there. And since that camera arrived yesterday, I’m hoping to maybe have some photos to post by the weekend. We’ll see. It’s been a busy few days for me.
Anyway, feel free to add this new blog to your RSS reader of choice. I apologize for changing things, but I did what I felt was best for me. Stay tuned for all of the weird rambles you’ve come to expect, haha.</span>

                              <span>Today is one of those days when I feel I have nothing to write.
Then I started thinking...
What is it that says you have to have something to write to start writing? It&#x27;s just an idea, an idea of how things work.
You have something to write.
You write it.
It doesn&#x27;t have to be like that. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to just start writing without having anything to write about. Or, as one writer put it, sit down at the typewriter and just bleed.
There are so many things in life that we have preconceptions about...
It should be sunny on Midsummer day (it&#x27;s a Swedish thing), everyone should be happy on Christmas Eve and the slice of cheese should be on top of the hamburger (ok, bad example – it should always be on top).
When life doesn&#x27;t go the way it&#x27;s “supposed to” (read: the way we demand) - which of course is often the case - the whole world is turned upside down.
What if we slow down a bit when it comes to how things &quot;should be”? What if we face the day with a little &quot;let&#x27;s see what this day (or blank sheet of paper) brings&quot;?
It&#x27;s worth trying.</span>

It was warm and cozy in his room.The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, seemed to hug him in a comforting embrace. He was safe here, cocooned in this familiar space. As long as he didn’t open the door, he could pretend. Pretend that everything was okay, that the world outside was just as gentle and forgiving as his secluded corner.
Sometimes, he heard loud, jarring knocks on the door. Bang Bang. Each knock sounded like a thunderclap, threatening to shatter his illusion. The door, scarred from previous assaults, was almost giving way. He remembered being afraid, trembling as he went to the door and pressing his body weight against it to lend it support. After all, it was his sole protector from the outside world, a barrier between him and the…</span>

What triggers this feeling of being overwhelmed for no reason? From an outside perspective, there is no objective reason things should feel so heavy. My circumstances have not markedly changed. There are no notable stressors present. Yet, internally, everything seems foggy, fuzzy, and oppressive. On these overwhelming days, I want so badly to grasp why I feel this way or make sense of some cause, yet no cause or reason can be found. The only reasonable response is rebellion through persistent, passionate, and lucid living despite it all.</span>

When singing was involved I would usually remain silent, worrying that I would sound off key, or that I wouldn&#x27;t know the words and people would notice, or any other myriad of possible scenarios which are common to those who worry endlessly about stuff. In some way, I perceived the act of singing as something very intimate and I never managed to break through that barrier I had imposed upon myself. That is, until I had a son, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy.
After he was born, my wife used to sing to him all the time. She has beautiful voice, knows lots of songs, and is so confident in her ability that she doesn&#x27;t really think about it. I, however, shied away from the act, as if a panel of ju…</span>

Synopsis
 How can the link between city and child be made more fruitful and enjoyable for both the child and the city? 
 At a time when a significant proportion of the city’s children are at war with their environment, the question raised by this book becomes ever more urgent for teachers and parents, citizens and policy makers. Through an enormously rich range of refere…</span>

Title: International Workers Aid To Bosnia
Subtitle: Syndicalists truck flour directly to Bosnia unions
Date: December 1994
Notes: This article, from a presentation on June 1993 at the European Syndicalist Conference, appeared in Nov.-Dec. 1994 Industrial Worker newspaper

 I’d like to present to you a very concrete example of international solidarity and proof that it really works. I’m here as spokeswoman for International Workers Aid but I’m also a member of SAC which played an important role in developing this idea to reality. 
 International Workers Aid started last summer with a plea for help from mine workers in Tuzla, a mining town in central Bosnia, to comrades in Britain. The miners of Tuzla have a long his…</span>

                              <span>I saw a documentary about the Swedish singer-songwriter and poet Cornelis Vreeswijk. In one of the scenes, someone tells Cornelis that writing seems to be necessary for him.
He replies:
Yes, it is. I can panic if I&#x27;m not allowed to write.
I think many of us can relate to that, at least to some extent. I know that I can. That’s why we write.
If I don&#x27;t write in one form or another, it&#x27;s like a blockage in the system. To get that shit out, I need to write in one form or another. Blog, journal, napkin - it doesn&#x27;t matter. Just get it out of the system.
I think it was Stephen King who said something like:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t have time to read, how will you have time to write?”
For me, it&#x27;s the other way around. If I don&#x27;t write, there&#x27;s no way I can be fully present and absorb what I&#x27;m reading.
Writing is a valve, a way to release the pressure of repetitive thoughts. Writing is a way to give words to the wordless. Writing is an unfiltered way of speaking.</span>
