Title: What is the Proletariat?
Date: 2024/05/10
Source: Retrieved on 2024-07-16 from 

 In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Manifesto of the Communist Party. It famously ends by declaring, “let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. Proletarians have nothing to lose in it but their chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries unite!” (Marx and Engels 1996, 30). The word proletariat continues to be used by socialists and communists today. This does not mean that the word is widely understood. Some people use it as a meaningless adjective whereby their ideas, attitudes, and activities are proletarian. Those of people they dislike are bourgeois. Others equate the proletaria…</span>

1. THE NORTH BOTHNIA LINE
Why aiming at this beast?
 This is a call to action against the North Bothnia Line, a railway just beginning to be built along the coast of Swedish-occupied Sápmi. This project is a continuation of several hundred years of brutal colonization of the peoples and lands in Sápmi. Extractive industries are thriving on the increased demand for raw materials following the so-called “green transition”. This makes them continually stress the importance and urgency of the train line. So do the Swedish State and the European Union.

 Operation ‘Scripta Manent’ is one repressive operation among the many that have already occurred, and continue to occur, against comrades who dare to oppose the Italian State. The pretext here was of trying to find those who have taken part in Informal Anarchist Federation attacks since 2005, but it is also an attempt to destroy all insurrectional conflict in Italy and to cut off any solidarit…</span>

We’re taking this as an occasion to respond and to clarify ideas that we’ve been reflecting on for a few years now.

 This text was written during the course of the growing European social war, and our attempts to situate ourselves in the context of that, whilst in the midst of rising fascism, complicity from most of the society and a fractured and divisive anti-capitalist ‘movement’. These scant few pages cannot express the complexity of the various situations being described in any great depth, but we write so that other rebels at the edges can know how it is for us here.

Abstract:
 The article presents a first overview of the emergence and early development of anarchism in the Republic of Cyprus, utilising archival material. It contextualises Cypriot anarchism within the broader wave of political ideas making their appearance after the island’s de-facto partition in 1974, tracing the formation of the first anarchist groups and the circulation of early Cypriot anarchist publications. It moves on to briefly discuss three key historical moments of anarchist political expression, followed by an examination of early Cypri…</span>

Abstract
 This dissertation examines the structure of Cypriot anarchist ideology and the way it challenges Greek Cypriot ethnic nationalism, as it developed in the first decade following the partition of the island of Cyprus. It aims to contribute to the understanding of grass root political activity in Cyprus, by examining the early expressions of anarchism in the island. Ideology has been argued to function around the use of key discursive signifiers, through which the mediation of a fixed meaning is structured and social reality is experienced. This research…</span>

                              <span>I consider myself a pretty fast reader. I typically get through a book way before it needs to be returned back on Libby1. I get 21 days to finish a book (although my friends have reported 14 days), and that is usually plenty of time. With that said, I’ve never stressed about finishing a book in time.
Until now.
It’s taking me forever to finish A Court of Silver Flames by Sarah J. Maas. It’s not that it’s a terrible book but I haven’t been finding enough energy to read lately. I even switched to listening on Spotify Premium, and I’m still not done.
Anyways.
The return due date has come and gone, but I’m still not done with the book. For those who are familiar with the ACOTAR series, it’s pretty popular right now so the wait time is pretty long. I was on hold for several months for each book in the series… and I’m registered in three libraries. Doing another hold on this book means I’m going to have to wait months again.
💡 Enter the Kindle / Libby workaround.
I read my e-books via my Kindle Oasis and/or Kindle Paperwhite. To avoid the book auto returning on its due date, I just put the Kindle where it’s downloaded on Airplane mode. Voila! The book is there until you connect back to the Internet.
If you have a ton of books you want to get through way past your deadline, this is the way to go.
📙 Bonus hack: did you buy a Kindle with ads? Typically you have to pay $20(?) to get it removed. I just called Customer Service and told them that some of these ads are inappropriate for the minor who also has access to my account. They removed it for free. Now my Kindle screensaver is the cover of the book that I am currently reading.
You’re welcome, and happy reading!

                              <span>it was hard to write anything at all on the cruise ship last may. i&#x27;d spend so much of the day walking that by night time my feet were fast asleep before i was. i also generally found that there was so little for me to say. i could only describe X, Y, and Z as “so cool” &amp;  “so interesting” so many times before it got dull. so i’ll say it just once here! each stop was, in fact, so cool and so interesting. i do love good food, old architecture, and scenic views – europe has these aplenty. i just wish i spent more time birdwatching. (but i knew that that would be particularly difficult to do on such a tight schedule).
honestly, before my trip, i was 100% convinced i’d hate being on the ocean for such long stretches of time. and this is still partially true now that it&#x27;s over. i’m prone to motion sickness and i’m afraid of a slow death. i ended up partially bedridden for three days, so i was right to worry about the former. i couldn’t eat anything but apples, and i threw up everytime i moved from my bed. it sucked, but at least i&#x27;m not dead.
when i recovered, i discovered that it was ironically grounding to stroll the topmost deck and see nothing but blue and horizon. and that it was especially beautiful at night, even if you couldn&#x27;t really see the stars at all. instead, i’d watch the water long enough for it to look like a fingerprint. then, even longer to find the unicorns in the sea foam. i found myself returning to the same thought each time: in the grand scheme of all things, i am fortunately very small. i will never run out of earth to explore. nothing is never really just nothing, but nothing feels as good as finally being home too.</span>

the brief answer would be that i live for other people. 

long one from here: when the future feels bleak, i keep going because i imagine someone could maybe benefit from my sticking it out at some point. 

ignoring the fact that i sound like a walking savior complex — it&#x27;s more like, there are too many moving parts to write off. 

no matter how average or ordinary you feel, nobody else is going to know what you know the way you know it. nobody is going to do the same things you do, whether you achieve your goals or not. that you spend time reflecting on your place in the world at all means you&#x27;re probably doing your best at living, and chances are you&#x27;re gonna move somebody somewhe…</span>

                              <span>A lot of people think AMD should support these translation layers but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea. CUDA is not designed to be vendor agnostic and Nvidia can make things arbitrarily difficult both technically and legally. For example I think it would be against the license agreement of cuDNN or cuBLAS to run them on this. So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.
Chasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool&#x27;s errand. The important users of CUDA are open source. AMD can implement support directly in the upstream projects like pytorch or llama.cpp. And once support is there it can be maintained by the community.</span>

The schematic capture elements to connect up large blocks of HDL with a ton of I/O going everywhere are one of the few applications of visual programming that I like. Once you get past defining the block behaviors in HDL, instantiation can become tedious and error-prone in text, since the tools all kinda suck with very little hinting or argument checking, and the modules can and regularly do have dozens of I/O arguments. Instead, it&#x27;s often very easy to map the module inputs to schematic-level wires, particularly in situations where large buses can be combined into single fat lines, I/O types can be visually distinguished, etc. IDE keyboard shortcuts also make these signals easy to follow and trace as they pass through hierarch…</span>

The man who attempted to kill Donald Trump believed his bullet would change the course of history for the better. Such thinking is common and is promoted in most school books that exhort young people to be better citizens by featuring the stories of national heroes who have changed the world. The killer’s belief that murdering a political leader could improve the nation was the logical converse of this mistaken principle. More

 These are times when it seems there are big discussions about the issue of cities, urban areas, about the possibilities of revolt inside them (even of living), of their reformability. Big discussions frequently focused on various topics relating to struggles carried out by many opponents, antagonists, often reformists, sometimes even by enemies of every order and authority; among these issues there is gentrification, a word not so unusual anymore, a word we now want to express some thoughts about.

We Are not Spectators but Enemies of all Forms of Dominion
 Today we wanted to give vent to a small anarchist impulse by brandishing the weapons of life and the ideas of rebellion. 
 As we are convinced that the status quo is being maintained not only by those who hold power but also by the servile attitude of those who tacitly support it, toady we decided to attack polling station 98a in the town of La Reina with an explosive/incendiary device.

 One time, maybe ten years back, I was on the DC metro with my family. My brother and I were happily talking about the feminist implications of GI Joe, because my brother is cool as hell, when a stranger looked over at my father (not knowing we were related) to complain about how I spoke. 
 “They really don’t teach people how to speak English anymore,” the stranger complained. 
 I’m not the world’s fighty-est person, but I’ve also never been the world’s least fighty person, so I confronted him immediately. “Oh?!” I asked. “What’s wrong with the way we’re talking?!”

 There’s not much to be said about an episode of repression, after all it’s the simple cyclical occurrence of action and reaction – or even on how repression plays dirty – another well-known fact. At most these are just a few notes on the development of techniques and strategies. 
 This I’ll try to do.

 According to your court indictment, Conspiracy of Cells of Fire is a terrorist organization. But words were never, nor are or will ever be neutral. Words acquire the meaning given by the person who uses them. We do not speak the language of the judges and prosecutors. We speak the language of the hunted who have refused the victimʼs role, the wanted who have not handed themselves in to the authorities, the prisoners who have not caged their will for freedom, the anarchists who have never kneeled in front of Power.

On the 27th of April, Christos Tsakalos, for the case of C.C.F. with the upgraded charge of the managerial executive, was transported to the prisons of Koridallos, after a call for appearance at the juridical council, where he denies to appear.
 Today therefore, Wednesday the 27th of April, I announce officially to the juridical authorities, to not “bother me again” with their repeated calls for my presence in the interrogative process, because they will receive my total refusal and my factual contempt.

Notes: We created this zine to hand out alongside ice packs and gatorade as a deadly heatwave swept accross our region. At time of posting, that heatwave is continuing east across North America, and more will certainly follow in the coming months and years as the climate crisis worsens. While this zine contains a couple sentences specific to so-called Boulder Colorado, it should still be broadly applicable, and we encourage people to print and distribute it anywhere that’s affected by extreme heat. We note that the advice contained within is not particularly useful without the supplies needed to follow it, and we recommend accompanying this zine with water, electrolyte powder…</span>

 148 years ago this week, on April 6, 1871, armed participants in the revolutionary Paris Commune seized the guillotine that was stored near the prison in Paris. They brought it to the foot of the statue of Voltaire, where they smashed it into pieces and burned it in a bonfire, to the applause of an immense crowd.[1] This was a popular action arising from the grassroots, not a spectacle coordinated by politicians. At the time, the Commune controlled Paris, which was st…</span>

 The purpose of this piece is to better understanding of mass media’s relationship to rebels (including anarchists of all stripes), in general as well as in the context of a repressive atmosphere in Bristol. As well as raising local specifics, it hopes to encourage stronger awareness around wider issues of representation and counter-insurgency.

Alright, I know they are not bad activities at all and they might be one of the ways to enrich our inner selves. But traveling is neither holy nor sacred.
In my 20s, I loved exploring new places. I hitchhiked around Eastern Europe, rode my touring bicycle along the coast in western Türkiye and went on numerous camping trips.

I am active in very few Discord servers and most of them are small, friends-only groups. However, in the few public ones I am in, I often see groups of people whose choices of words and how to express themselves, how to enter conversations, their tone and views make them feel eerily... unreal.

The problem is, I have a family and finding fulfilling work that you have no experience in, in this country, at 50, is close to impossible.
So for now I consider myself lucky and try to rediscover the fun things in programming.</span>

THE TWILIGHT ZONE — Picture if you will the citizens of a small town in Northeast Ohio, facing a daunting toxic threat yet trapped in a maze of regulatory capture at the so-called Environmental Protection Agency. Not the citizens of East Palestine, though they too face a challenging quest for the truth about the environmental health threats they may face. But the citizens in and around Uniontown, Ohio have been trapped in such a quagmire for decades, subjected to a dystopian level of gaslighting from the powers that be in an effort to bury the truth regarding the ultra-hazardous poisons reportedly dumped at the town landfill.
The Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL) in Uniontown closed in 1980 and was designated as an EPA Superfund site in 1984, listed as one of the most contaminated sites in the country. Akron area rubber companies were the biggest known polluters at the IEL, dumping millions of gallons of industrial waste and chemicals in the ‘60s and ‘70s. But local citizen eyewitnesses have long testified that the U.S. military was another covert client in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s. This includes the IEL’s former owner Charles Kittinger, who came forward in 2001 to speak of clandestine dumping of three metal eggs of nuclear weapons waste he was eerily warned not to speak of.

                              <span>Part of the problem with this brand is that this &quot;Android 13 Smartphone&quot; will probably stay that forever. Updates are very very minimal.
I have their first jelly and it didn&#x27;t even get the upgrade they promised.
Other than that, it&#x27;s not so bad. Swype-typing makes a small keyboard still useful. But the updates really are the achilles heel here.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m no longer under this specific NDA, so, I can talk a bit about this.
It was well known in the wireless industry that ATT collected and kept the most data on all of the carriers:  7 years for text metadata, &quot;7 years&quot; for call history (I put that in quotations because it was rumored that ATT kept them indefinitely, but, there were technical limitations for restoring data that far back), and 7 years for the contents of the text messages themselves.  Verizon was up there as well, but, I don&#x27;t remember specifics.
The carrier that I worked with kept only 3 days content of the actual messages, 28 days for the text message metadata, and 28 days for the call records for their enforcement database, but, they could get calling records and sms envelope information for billing back 7 years, and at the time, we had to implement sharding at the database layer that maintained the warrant database due to the amount of traffic that we were receiving from the calling systems and the amount of queries/data that we were sending out, in near realtime, to law enforcement users who paid $10,000/month for access to that data.
AT&amp;T wasn&#x27;t storing this data out of the kindness of their heart, it was a (probably small) revenue stream for them.</span>

                              <span>It took me a while to get settled into this particular space of mine on the Interwebs. I didn&#x27;t know what I wanted out of it, but over time (past few months) it just kind of grew into its own thing.
Notes by JCProbably started out as just a place for scrappy thoughts, and scattered notes. Nothing too serious. It was hosted on a different platform, while what I called my &quot;primary&quot; blog (titled: With Love, JCProbably) was hosted in another1. That one included my microposts that I labeled as musings.
When starting this Notes subdomain, I initially said2
I&#x27;m hoping to use this page as a more scattered note, a digital post-it of some sort, when I think of things... and possibly just start linking more coherent thoughts when I write my Week Notes to it.
After the May challenge, I started writing more in this space. By June, I transferred it to Bear (where you&#x27;re reading this now), and I&#x27;m in a much more comfortable space when it comes to writing and blogging.
Anyways, all of this to say that I am also looking into (re)adding my short-form thoughts and musings here (to consolidate everything). I&#x27;ve come to accept that I don&#x27;t need to always have a long-winded post about a specific topic on here.
Sometimes I really just want to write a few sentences about how I&#x27;m feeling, or ponder on some thoughts, and calling it a day.
These posts will be tagged #musings — in case you were curious (but probably not). And no, those will (hopefully) not be as long as this ended up to be. I&#x27;m also hoping to include just every day photos that are a little bit more casual3 than what I post on my site specifically for photos.
Okay, that&#x27;s it. Seriously.

It still is, but I haven&#x27;t been wanting to go on there lately, so I&#x27;m not even going to link it on here.↩


Original post did not make it through the migration process.↩


Veronique has been my inspiration on this front, if I&#x27;m being honest. I love how she incorporates just daily photos in her posts. Go check out her blog and posts!↩</span>

                              <span>spotify is legal piracy. you can listen to most of your music by just paying a small amount and most of that doesn&#x27;t go to the artist. hell with the rise of AI, enshittification got to a level that it never has before. I just don&#x27;t want to be a part of that anymore.
there is also another reason I&#x27;m doing this. having physical files of your collection feels great. you can take your music collection anywhere you want, convert it to any format you wish and use any music player you fancy. it is at times a bit time consuming but I enjoy growing my collection and not having to throw money at a faceless company just to keep listening to my music.

how I manage it
I download most of my music as flacs then convert it to opus at 160kbps. the ones I couldn&#x27;t get as flacs stay as mp3s. I store them in an SD card and use poweramp as my music app. I am not really settled on it yet, so recommendations are welcome.
I use last.fm and regular old internet browsing for recommendations. I never really used spotifys recommendation algorithm to begin with, because i value a passionate music fans words more than an algorithm.
notes
you can also take a look at kit&#x27;s post for an artists perspective on why spotify is shitty as a platform. kit puts it into words better than I ever could.

                              <span>Yesterday I was watching a Swedish music documentary. In one of the scenes, the artist Errol (aka Eddie Meduza) says:
If you think too much, you go crazy. Take life as it comes.
True words — and all too easy to forget. We put so much emphasis on thinking in our modern society that the gut feeling, the inner vibe, has been overshadowed. We think like crazy, even in moments when thinking brings nothing but confusion and fatigue.
Thinking has an important role, of course. We can make great use of this ability to plan, prepare, and make calculated decisions. But often the best thing we can do is &quot;take life as it comes.&quot;</span>

There&#x27;s possibly a FISA court requirement (too secret to reveal), but AT&amp;T has long been an exceedingly willing part of the gov&#x27;s spying apparatus. It fed these records and Internet data to the feds without any court order, and only escaped legal troubles when Obama, contrary to his campaign promises, gave AT&amp;T, Verizon and more retroactive immunity</span>

                              <span>I wrote this to solve a few things I cared about.
* I want to show people that native WebRTC players can be a thing. I hope this encourages hangouts/discord/$x to implement WHIP and WHEP it would let people do so much more
* I wanted to make low latency sharing easier. I saw the need for this working on adding WebRTC to OBS and Broadcast Box[0]
* I wanted to show devs what a great ecosystem exists for WebRTC. Lots of great implementations in different languages.
* Was a bit of a ‘frustration project’. I saw a company claiming only their proprietary protocol can do latency this low. So I thought ‘screw you I will make an open source version!’

                              <span>The benefit of journaling is not just reentry, but that you begin to solidify the mental model into a concrete branching of possibilities that is tightly coupled to the specific problem. Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn&#x27;t miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.
Perhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn&#x27;t a failure, it&#x27;s essential, especially for problems in systems you&#x27;ve never used before. Over time you may yourself build up your expertise such that you no longer need the aid, but  that doesn&#x27;t signal anything about your intelligence or ability either, only your experience.</span>

                              <span>Until the US federal government pays civilian tech talent competitively, this is always going to be an issue.
Your typical hands-on-keyboard blue team engineer in federal government is a GS-12 getting paid around $68,000 per year (or $99k in very high cost of living areas like DC). They have expensive health benefits, 13 days of PTO a year, put a huge chunk of their paycheck (almost 5%) into a mandatory pension plan that consistently underperforms the market, and can literally go to jail for making mistakes at work depending on the statutory context they work in.
The best people in these jobs burn out fast and quit or they end up having to abandon IC work for GS-14/15 jobs (max pay is around $190 for those) in order to keep up with cost-of-living and justify their careers.
As a result, you have almost zero genuinely capable principal/senior engineers in government who have the authority to architect complex IT systems for security. Instead you get contractors who charge the taxpayers enormous overhead costs and cut corners wherever possible.
If there&#x27;s one letter to write your congress person to improve government - my vote would be for civil service reform to attract and retain actual top tech talent. They&#x27;ve done it for doctors and lawyers (both of whom can get paid well above the $190k GS pay ceiling), but engineering is still not treated as a comparably skilled professional trade.</span>

Laws related to data breaches need to have much sharper teeth. Companies are going to do the bare minimum when it comes to securing data as long as breaches have almost no real consequences. Maybe pierce the corporate veil and criminally prosecute those whose negligence made this possible. Maybe have fines that are so massive that company leadership and stockholders face real consequences.</span>

                              <span>So, these wont be the traditional notes where you write down your understanding or something. No. Never worked for me. Too boring and I never actually read again. What works is just having a bunch of questions that I can answer again and understand. So thats what it would be. Do it with your favorite llm for additional fun but take the effort to answer yourself first. That is the point.
And for the blog part, I will write if I feel I can add some new value by connecting things or simplify things down in a unique way.

 Left and far-left forces dominated the Ukrainian political space. After the February Revolution of 1917, N.

                              <span>I was diagnosed with lupus a few years ago. My mom also had it and passed away after 10 years due to complications. My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job.
I did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn’t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation.
Previously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free.
I also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn’t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I’ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation.
I hope this helps, though it’s just my personal experience.</span>

In other words: If you&#x27;re trying to improve your security posture, installing an ad-blocker is one of the best things you can do. If you have less tech-savvy friends and relatives, I would strongly recommend setting up uBlock Origin for them.</span>

                              <span>A family friend of ours recently fell victim to a phishing attack perpetrated by an attacker who paid for Google Ads for a search term like &quot;BANKNAME login&quot;. The site was an immaculate knock off, with a replay attack in the background. She entered her 2fa code from the app on her phone but the interface rejected the code and asked her for another one. In the background, this 2nd code was actually to authorise the addition of a new &quot;pay anyone&quot; payee, and with that her money was gone[0].
I have accounts with 2 banks, one uses SMS 2fa and the other uses an app which generates a token. I had thought that the app was by default a better choice because of the inherent lack of security in SMS as a protcol BUT in the above attack the bank that sends the SMS would have been better because they send a different message when you&#x27;re doing a transfer to a new payee than when you&#x27;re logging in.
So really the ideal is not just having an app that generates a token but one that generates a specific type of token depending on what type of transaction you&#x27;re performing and won&#x27;t accept, for example, a login token when adding a new payee. I haven&#x27;t seen any bank with that level of 2fa yet, has anyone else?
I guess perhaps passkeys make this obsolete anyway since it establishes a local physical connection to a piece of hardware.

It has the accuracy/time trade-off you&#x27;re interested in, but the implementation is quite different. It samples random points on the disk and finds out what file path they belong to. The longer it runs the more accurate it gets. The readme is good at explaining why this approach makes sense for btrfs and what its limitations are.

                              <span>There are some people around us who live on a totally different frequency, especially in the work environment.
They never shut up.
They always seek a chance to talk to you.
They don&#x27;t let you have a peaceful and silent moment.
They talk but don&#x27;t say anything.
They do not understand that we just need peaceful and silent moment.
They do not understand that we don&#x27;t like them.
They expect attention and response.
It is hell when I see them around. I just cannot escape. I usually try to put my headphones on and listen to music at full volume. But this time, they wave their hand at me to talk to me - and in that moment I want to scream.
It does not matter if you give them very short answers and ignore. They never stop.

Because of this, I developed a habit of looking at the floor so that I won&#x27;t have eye contact with them. Sometimes I close my eyes and pretend to be sleeping. It&#x27;s so difficult to be kind sometimes. 

My social battery is already pretty weak and people who live on a different frequency are just torturing my soul. People like me should work at a cave or something like that. I lose my sanity when I want peaceful moment while having no escape.</span>

                              <span>My apartment doesn&#x27;t have power.
They&#x27;re doing some kind of maintenance.
The air is hot and thick, and I&#x27;m pining for some AC.
Took the doggo out for our morning walk and stopped at Timmies to get a coffee and breakfast sandwich, then remembered I had to walk up four flights of stairs bc—no power.
K drove me back to the city last night, and as much as I miss being in the country...coming home to my own apartment and bed felt nice.
As I was falling asleep, I saw the tiniest of ants crawling up my arm, and immediately murder, death, kill for that little guy and of course I then googled what would happen if an ant crawled into your ear and nothing good came out of that.
I distracted myself by watching some ASMR and fell asleep in my perfectly temperature-controlled bedroom (K&#x27;s apartment is a veritable icebox).
** his mom crocheted me a shawl(!!!), and I think my heart imploded. Nothing says i love you more than here...I made you something.

Swedish unions are governed from the top down and are therefore bad at serving workers&#x27; interests. So writes Rasmus Hästbacka of the syndicalist union SAC. Based on his new book, he suggests how worker-led unions can be rebuilt.
 It’s a truism that capitalism is not a democracy; capitalism means economic dictatorship, which is most evident in our workplaces.…</span>

Illegalist Number
 There is some confusion,
 about the magnitude of revolutionary action,
 by individuals who live in civilization,
 and work,
 and pay taxes. 
 These individuals talk a lot about insurrection,
 and about revolution,
 and destitution,
 but seem in every way other than talk,
 to support the capitalist systems of oppression. 
 So in an effort to help all those who,
 by talking so much,
 confuse words with action,
 appraise the extent of their efforts toward their purported ends,
 we introduce the ILLEGALIST NUMBER. 
The Illegalist Number

through destruction,
expropriation,

Title: What Does Putin Want?
Subtitle: The Russian autocrat is not crazy, war is simply a necessity for his power and economic system

 Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin outlined five goals for his war: Ukraine’s non-alignment with NATO; a change in Ukraine’s government; a severe limitation of Ukraine’s defence capacity; the seizure of Ukrainian territory (with international recognition); and the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia. 
 In the first weeks of the war, Putin also had a maximalist agenda: the quick occupatio…</span>

                              <span>Throughout the twentieth century, steady technological and organizational innovations, along with the accumulation of productive capital, increased labor productivity at a steady rate of around 2 percent per year. However, the past two decades have witnessed a slowdown in labor productivity, measured as value added per hour worked. This slowdown has been particularly stark in the manufacturing sector, which historically has been a leading sector in driving the productivity of the aggregate U.S. economy. What makes this slowdown particularly puzzling is the fact that manufacturing accounts for the majority of U.S. research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure. Despite several recent studies (see, for example, Syverson [2016]), much remains to be uncovered about the nature of this slowdown. This post illustrates a key facet of the mystery: the productivity slowdown appears to be pervasive across industries and across firms of various sizes.</span>

                              <span>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is key to this discovery, appears to be super relevant to psoriasis, another autoimmune disease.
AhR has been known for a long time, but it seems it&#x27;s been somewhat mysterious until a series of recent breakthroughs. In 2022, an AhR inhibitor called tapinarof, sold as VTAMA, was launched, and has shown itself to be one of the most effective treatments for psoriasis to date. It&#x27;s also unique in that it appears to have the ability to bring lasting remission. In the main clinical trial, patients who used VTAMA for one year and then stopped had a mean remission duration of 4 months until their psoriasis returned. That is unheard of for any topical medication used on psoriasis.
Blocking AhR has also shown promise in treating MS [1].
I haven&#x27;t read the lupus paper, but often with papers like these, the &quot;cause&quot; turns out not to be the actual origin, but some cytokine or other protein that is more disease-specific than current drug targets. This lupus discovery appears to identify an imbalance that may be compensated for, but we still don&#x27;t know what triggers the imbalance in the first place.
In some cases diseases turn out to be a genetic fault, but my money is on pathogens acting as the initial triggering event, which then spins the immune system into a vicious cycle of autoimmunity. In psoriasis we see this with strep bacteria, for example, but the exact mechanisms are not well understood. However, the mechanism that makes psoriasis chronic has been identified, a type of T-cell called a tissue-resident memory (TRM) T-cell. This type of cell acts as a kind of biological memory for infections.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on the same camp, but in the end it turns out we were not putting it to the actual, real, hard-world test.
VSCode is very fast for me, when I open it in the morning and just starting my day.
But once I&#x27;ve opened the main project and 7 support library&#x27;s projects, and I&#x27;m in a video-call on Chrome sharing my screen (which is something that eats CPU for breakfast), and I&#x27;m live-debugging a difficult to reproduce scenario while changing code on the fly, then the test conditions are really set up where differences between slow/heavy and fast/lightweight software can be noticed.
Things like slowness in syntax highlighting, or jankyness when opening different files. Not to mention what happened when I wanted to show the step-by-step debugging of the software to my colleagues.
In summary: our modern computer&#x27;s sheer power are camouflaging poor software performance. The difference between using native and Electron apps, is a huge reduction in the upper limit of how many things you can do at the same time in your machine, or having a lower ceiling on how many heavy-load work tasks your system can be doing before it breaks.</span>

An LLM may just be responding based on (1) the fact that you&#x27;re asking about the clip in the first place, and that commonly happens when there&#x27;s something wrong; and (2) that this is a very common failure mode. This is supported by it bringing up the &quot;never saddle a dead horse&quot; mnemonic, which suggests the issue is common.
After you fix it, you should try asking the same questions!</span>

 So for those who don’t already know about our case and a small update: 
 On November 3, 2022 we four comrades were arrested, accused of the arson attack to the meat company Susaron, a national industry that has been supplying the whole country with beef, pork and poultry meat for years. 
 On November 4, we were remanded in custody for the duration of the investigation. Accused of burning six trucks, t…</span>

 By &quot;Anjin&quot; is meant here spiritual calmness created by Prajna. Prajna is a unique intuition that sees the true nature of things as they are (Yathabhutam). &quot;Zazen-shin&quot; (坐 禅 箴, Instruction in Zazen) by Dogen (1200 -1253) reads: &quot;A bird flies as a bird does; a fish swims likes a fish!&quot; The essence of things seen by Prajna or Yathatathyadarsana (如 実 見, seeing into the truth as it is) is named &quot;Suchness&quot; (tathata) or &quot;Emptiness&quot; (sunyata), because it is beyond our daily expression which is the result of discriminative consciousness …</span>

Title: Some Zapatista Principles &amp; Practices...
Date: 2009
Source: Scanned from “Sharing Leadership Series Handout 5.6.09”

 The Zapatista indigenous movement in Chiapas, México has summarized many of their principles into short, accessible sayings that convey big ideas about a different way of leading and building power, which contrast greatly with repressive/oppressive methods of holding power and authority. 
Mandar Obedeciendo (Lead by Obeying)
 PRINCIPLE: True leaders follow the will of the people, the desires of the larger community. 
 PRACTICE: This principle challenges authoritarianism in the communities, and representatives who are not accountable to the widespread desires of the community will be ousted from their positions. In many of the communities, an oversig…</span>

I started writing about Going Infinite about the highly autistic Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, FTX and its downfall. However, I couldn&#x27;t do it justice. I recommend picking up the book and reading it for yourself. FWIW, after reading it, your pov should remain the same of &quot;crypto is highly retarded&quot;.
Instead of going down that rabbit hole, I decided to go for a feel-good post with a little update since deciding to step away from my former profession...

i am absolutely exploding inside with this news, but i have no way to scream it, so this will have to do.
we&#x27;ve put an offer in on a house on sunday, and they accepted it today! i cannot believe it! i cried all the two hours it took for us to get home; partially because this is a dream that i have worked so hard for and never thought i&#x27;d actually get.
the house is deeply within our budget, thank goodness; but it&#x27;s pushing the limits of commute for my boyfriend, which is unfortunate. i wish it was still affordable to live within reasonable commuting distance of a major city like seattle, but i&#x27;m just so thankful that we&#x27;re staying in the pacific northwest. i&#x27;m really loving every second of being here, and it feels as though i was always meant to be here in this moment—i…</span>

 A couple weeks ago, I was talking to my friends who run the podcast It Could Happen Here. “Summer is coming, and an awful lot of people are newly radicalized. You all should put out an episode about what the next steps are,” I told them. 
 “Perfect,” someone replied. “Write it and record it by May 20th.” 
 So I wrote a short and incomplete guide for new activists. You can hear me present it in audio format if you’d like. 
 I’m coming with my own biases which I want to get out right up front: I’m an anarchist, and it’s also been decades since I broke into the movement, beca…</span>

 A short poem “Adoring Naivety” by a Christian poet Jukichi Yagi (1827–1927) runs as follows: 
 Rice bread, 
 Whole-rice bread, 
 Fresh and steaming! 
 Whole-rice bread! 
 A bread seller goes about a “Non-acting” (Mu-i 無 爲 akarma) path singing cries of wares, as if in ecstacy over his singing.[1]
 This verse seems to suggest the aesthetic character of the Japanese folks. In the early days, Japanese peddlers, such as gold-fish vendors, beancurd dealers and seedling-peddlers used to peddle by crying in rythmical voices. Mood, relish, flavour and atmosphere carry great weight in a Japanese life. “Japanese ph…</span>

Instead of a Prologue
 About the subject of “Individuality and the anarchist group”, one could say that it’s a timeless issue within the anarchist milieu… Is an anarchist individuality subjugated or liberated within a group? How does the individual encounter the collective? Can disagreements between comrades of the same collective be creative or do they inevitably lead to disputes, rivalries, intrigues, competitions and end up in rupture? 
 How are friendships and cliques able to bring about a cancellation of an anarchist group? 
 What is the relationship of an anarchist organization to the expulsions…</span>

Title: What Is Mutualism?
Date: 1927
Notes: This is a very interesting and valuable text on Mutualism. It is slightly dated in some points and a bit off the target when dealing with monetary matters. Nevertheless it remains a powerful exposition of the main tenets of Mutualism and a sincere plea in favour of the freedom and autonomy of the individual.

                              <span>A non-stressful day at work is hard to come by. I am constantly straddling the fine line between being burnt out, and just flipping a table and walking away. At the end of the day, those two feelings are basically the same side of a coin.
I work remotely full-time, for the most part. Sometimes I travel for workshops, but that’s mostly just at the beginning of kicking off a new product that I’ve been asked to build. Any other time, I’m mostly working in my home office, which has become my favorite place in the house, yet the place where I stress out the most.
I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I’m in meetings probably 5-6 hours a day. With a majority of my current team in Central and Eastern time zones (2-3 hours ahead of me), sometimes I also forget to take a break and eat. It’s easy to lose track of time when I’m focused on solving this problem or that.
I also forget to breathe.
The weather finally cooled down yesterday, and a little bit today before we hit another heat wave. LSC constantly encourages me, and at times pushes me to go for a walk. Take a walk around the block, and just breathe. We practice breathing together, inhaling and exhaling. Inhale the fresh air slowly, keep it in for a few seconds, exhale slowly. Then we go back in the house, and I feel a tiny bit better.
Sometimes we get into what we’re doing so deeply that we forget the essentials. We forget to breathe. We don’t notice it until we’re drowning, and it’s even harder to get back to the surface. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder to stop what you’re doing, take a walk if you can, and breathe.
So hey, let this be a reminder.
Go for a walk. Inhale that fresh air. Hold it in. Exhale.
