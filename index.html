I believe everyone here must know what depression is, right? Well, if you don’t know, you can click here and read more about it… Well, what probably some people don’t know is that there is chronic depression, meaning no matter how much you try to improve, change, take medication, find hobbies, or whatever the attempt may be; you will die with depression. And I’ve had it since I was 16, but I’m not going to tell you my age, right (I’m in my 20s, lol).
In the past, I have tried to kill myself, but I was saved by a guy who is a great friend, and at the time, I went to live at his house, to be away from everything and everyone, with my phone turned off, just studying 5/6 hours a day, creatin…</span>

 Jean-Baptiste Vidalou, “We Are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle” (Cambridge: Polity, 2023) 
 It’s shameful. The original French publication of We are Forests: Inhabiting Territories in Struggle by Jean-Baptiste Vidalou was in my hands since April 2018. Frequently described as “the French Seeing Like a State,” the book explores the art of state making in France. Having been in stimulating dialogues with Jean-Baptiste Vidalou (JBV) since 2018, and being linguistically challenged, I knew the general ideas and points in the book—…</span>

The workers are demanding a 40 percent wage increase, which is the bare minimum they need given the ground they have lost in past sell-out contracts from the bosses, combined with historic inflation levels and high living costs in the region. They are angry at Boeing’s shell games, including the attempt to take away their annual employee bonuses (called “AMPP”), which they were promised in return for being forced to accept higher healthcare costs in a past contract.

This is because the perception increasingly is that the Court is deciding cases not based on neutral legal principles but on the basis of ideology. More

                              <span>&gt; &quot;I keep this blog for me to write, not necessarily for others to read.&quot;
This is now to me the &quot;old school&quot; internet creator attitude (that I still possess). I don&#x27;t blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.
The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly &quot;Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?&quot;
I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that as the end and only goal of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it&#x27;s been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don&#x27;t participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these &quot;professional&quot; creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.</span>

                              <span>In support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) creates flood maps that indicate areas with high flood risk, where mortgage applicants must buy flood insurance. The effects of flood insurance mandates were discussed in detail in a prior blog series. In 2021 alone, more than $200 billion worth of mortgages were originated in areas covered by a flood map. However, these maps are discrete, whereas the underlying flood risk may be continuous, and they are sometimes outdated. As a result, official flood maps may not fully capture the true flood risk an area faces. In this post, we make use of unique property-level mortgage data and find that in 2021, mortgages worth over $600 billion were originated in areas with high flood risk but no flood map. We examine what types of lenders are aware of this “unmapped” flood risk and how they adjust their lending practices. We find that—on average—lenders are more reluctant to lend in these unmapped yet risky regions. Those that do, such as nonbanks, are more aggressive at securitizing and selling off risky loans.</span>

The Bretton Woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological, feminist and anti-racist bifurcation. To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions.

                              <span>Javier Milei has been in office for less than a year, but he has taken his chainsaw to the government, as he promised. He chopped off half of the government ministries, devalued the peso by 50 percent, and slashed fuel subsidies. That was just the beginning. In the teeth of bitter opposition in Congress and in the streets, he got his “Bases Law” passed, which would allow him to roll back workers’ rights, provide tax incentives to foreign investors in extractive industries such as mining, forestry, and energy, reduce the tax burden on the rich, and provide him with the power to declare a one-year state of economic emergency with special powers to disband federal agencies and sell off about a dozen public companies.

I. UTOPIA — THE EVERLASTING DREAM
 Throughout the ages, from the earliest times, men of all nations have dreamed of that ‘ideal commonwealth whose inhabitants exist under perfect conditions’. What constitutes ‘perfect conditions’ is obviously a matter of personal preferences and prejudices, but there is a common basis to the visionary dream in all its forms — the increase of human happiness, or, perhaps, more accurately, well-being — the greatest good for the greatest number, whether it is the Golden Age of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, or the confused contemporary dream…</span>

DJ: What is Anarchism? 
JZ: I would say Anarchism is the attempt to eradicate all forms of domination. This includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, with its routine use of violence and the force of law, and the corporation, with its institutionalized irresponsibility, but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, homophobia. Also it is the attempt to expose the ways our philosophy, religion, economics, and other ideological constructions perform their primary function, which is to rationalize or naturalize–make seem natural–the domination tha…</span>

                              <span>Is anyone at Google even aware how much this hurts their brand?
I received an email from Google today with the subject line &quot;Meet the new Google TV Streamer (4K)&quot;
The sender was Google Chromecast. Apparently it&#x27;s some sort of streaming hardware they are selling for £99.
I won&#x27;t even consider buying one. How long until it&#x27;s an obsolete brick? And when it&#x27;s a brick, what are the chances I can wipe it and install my own software on it? Probably zero.
No thanks, Google. You&#x27;ve blotched your copybook too many times.</span>

                              <span>Hey,
How long has it been since I last created a blog post? 3 or 4 months? It’s been a long time and it has also been exhausting, both mentally and physically.
Honestly, when I thought about posting something here, I had an idea of what I wanted to write, that is, I knew what the topic would be, but I didn’t know when I would write it because I am mentally exhausted.
Have you ever wished that people wouldn’t talk to you? Because the only thing I’ve been thinking and wishing for is exactly that… I don’t want people to talk to me, I don’t care who it is, passerby or close friend, I just don’t want to talk or respond, so it can take me anywhere from seconds to weeks to respond, and it’s not because something happened or because I’m “afk” temporarily, but because I don’t feel like opening the …</span>

                              <span>five years! of estrogen!
five years! of breasts!
five years! of watching myself slowly morph into my mother
five years...
the lead up to getting on hrt nearly killed me. i came out to my mother when i was 17, and then to the rest of my family about a year later, just a few weeks before starting hormones. in the year between was a lot of counseling and therapy, working with specialists to try to figure out if this was really what i wanted (it was).
coming out wasn&#x27;t really my choice; the doctor said that they could &quot;try to do some creative billing,&quot; but that ultimately the bill would go through from the gender clinic, and the main insurance holder (my dad) would be able to see that. i was lucky enough that nobody in my (immediate) family cared too much. they all eventually moved over to my new name and pronouns (they/them, at the time -- being referred to as a woman then was, strangely, dysphoria inducing -- but she/her nowadays).
five years...
five years ago i was fresh out of high school. five years ago i had no direction. five years ago i had only barely begun to separate from my abusive father. five years ago i felt powerless.
five years later and a lot has changed. i&#x27;m away from him now! i broke into the software industry. i moved twice, i&#x27;m living with my partner (whom i met within the last five years). i&#x27;ve met so many wonderful friends. i&#x27;ve lost a few. i&#x27;ve bought a car. i&#x27;ve gotten over my long-standing fear of roller coasters. i&#x27;ve had more than a few mental health episodes... i&#x27;ve also healed a lot of trauma and anxiety. i&#x27;ve learned to be so much of a better person.
and yes, five years of hormones. five years of ruby.
wonder what&#x27;ll happen in the next five!</span>

                              <span>I’ve found that bloggers on this site are very passionate about the idea that you should challenge yourself to blog every day. it’s good for you to work out the writing muscle in your brain, it documents your thoughts, you have an archive of who you are, etc etc.
I don’t have much to say. it’s not that I lead some boring life, sometimes you just don’t have anything to comment on. this is a remarkable change for me as someone who tweeted at least 20 times a day over the past three years, but even then most twitter posts are just reactions to other twitter posts. I’ve never really just posted status updates of what I’m doing that day, I’m just commenting on something that came up on my for you.
I have the same issue with journaling. sometimes there is just nothing to say and no introspection to be done. I went to work, my coworkers did this, my kids did this, my parents are doing this, I’m doing whatever. it’s just, like, nothing.
this isn’t to say that everyone that blogs everyday is some sort of super genius with so much insight to offer the world so it’s only natural that they post everyday, because that’s not the case either. a lot of posts I see recently are quotes of something someone found elsewhere, responses to other blogs, blogging about blogging (like I’m doing now), or the typical introspective post.
I don’t know. I’m in the middle. viewing this from a quality over quantity perspective, you wouldn’t want to post everyday so you can just put out your best stuff, but isn’t blogging supposed to be about you? isn’t it supposed to be for you? and not the clamor for engagement and eyes on your post?
but it’s different for everyone, I guess. some people use bearblog like a portfolio, others like a diary, and others like a media dumping ground.
do what you want I guess is the answer here, if there’s an answer at all. no need for an answer, really.
on my end, I don’t think I’ll be a daily blogger. there just isn’t much to say. 🤷🏾‍♀️

                              <span>&quot;I could be wrong; I&#x27;ve been wrong once before.&quot;
A former coworker of mine used to say this. Of course, he said it as a joke, but it&#x27;s also a classic example of &#x27;it&#x27;s funny because it&#x27;s true&#x27;.
No one would seriously express themselves this way, but it seems to be the attitude many people harbor. I was reminded of this when I read Manuel Moreale&#x27;s great post, It should be easy to say &quot;My bad, I was wrong&quot;. He writes:
Saying &quot;I was wrong&quot; is a sign you&#x27;re willing to get better and improve.
So true! Making mistakes and being wrong is part of life&#x27;s learning curve, from the moment we take our first stumbling steps. We learn, develop, and move forward with newfound knowledge and wisdom.
But it&#x27;s as if our delicate little egos, built on something as fragile as always being right, are afraid of perishing if they admit to being wrong. It&#x27;s not only a fragile existence but also a very foolish attitude.
Often, when we make mistakes, it&#x27;s partly because someone else taught us wrong from the beginning. So, it&#x27;s not just our own ego we&#x27;re trying to protect but others as well. An impossible mission where the only thing that will self-destruct is ourselves.
Admitting that we were wrong is not only the right thing to do. It&#x27;s also significantly easier than fighting for the right to &quot;be right.&quot;
Let&#x27;s all do the right thing when we&#x27;re wrong by simply saying:
Sorry, I was wrong.

Claiming that these migrants were destroying the American “way of life,” Trump promised that, if elected, he  More

In fact, that&#x27;s the entire point of the Common Crawl project. Instead of dozens of companies writing and running their (poorly) designed crawlers and hitting everyone&#x27;s site, Common Crawl runs once and exposes the data in industry standard formats like WARC for other consumers. Their crawler is quite well behaved (exponential backoff, obeys Crawl-Delay, will use SiteMaps.xml to know when to revisit, follows Robots.txt, etc.).
There are significant knock-on effects if CloudFlare starts (literally) gatekeeping content. This feels like a step down the path to a world where the majority of websites use sophisticated security products that gatekeep access to those who pay and those who don&#x27;t, and that applied whether they are bots or people.</span>

I think it’s easy to pick apart the stuff that’s individually made Cohost such a wonderful place to exist on, and certainly added to the greater whole of the thing, but trying to sum up everything into A Post feels impossible. How do you sum up years of emotion and attachment in a way that’s, like, understandable to others outside your specific lived experience on a website built to let the individual tailor it to their desires.

                              <span>This impression is staying on my skin like ink stays on the stamp after the paper has already been stamped.
It’s as if every step has already been had. Every smile has been smiled. Every breath has been breathed. Every corner has been explored. One unique place holds on so much memories that it is starting to feel crowded, like this one subway line at 6:38 at night when you come back from work.
I feel this way about Lyon, the city where I grew up. In a kind of weird way that I did not notice at first, this impression became tiring.
It felt like being physically attached to my past. When you see multiple memories at every corner of the street, it makes creating new memories a bit more difficult.
I’ll give you an example.
This morning, I was just out for a morning run and I turned the corner…</span>

                              <span>”In your darkest hour, what saved you? What helped you find the strength to carry on?”
These are the questions posed by Matthew Graybosch for September&#x27;s IndieWeb Carnival, Power Underneath Despair.
My darkest moment in life occurred about five years ago. For a long time, I understood that something wasn&#x27;t right, but refused to accept it — both for those around me and for myself.
&quot;I&#x27;m handling this myself! I won’t let anyone think there’s something wrong with me, ever. I got this!&quot;
I tried weight training, yoga, meditation, running, seeking spirituality, reading books, attending online events, going on retreats…
While these activities provided some temporary relief, they weren&#x27;t enough. My issues ran deeper. I needed professional help but had the foolish belief that seeking it was a sign o…</span>

one week until i stop casually using social media. if you see my ass again it&#x27;s because i need to promote something or i&#x27;m reblogging art i like.
the past few years have taught me that i really don&#x27;t like the microblogging style of social media. you would think that a shorter character limit would lead to concision but it doesn&#x27;t; it just encourages you to split your thoughts across multiple posts.
i never really enjoyed &quot;posting&quot; on tumblr (which i realize sounds silly given that cohost lifted from tumblr&#x27;s design the most) so i&#x27;m unlikely to start doing that. i genuinely think this might be it for me. i will retreat to my group chats with friends and move to the pre-social media model: if i want to know how my friends are doing, i&#x27;ll ask them. if i&#x27;m gonna be in town somewhere and want to see someone, i&#x27;ll message them instead of posting into the void.
it&#x27;s all the same core theme: being deliberate. a focus on social media can hamper your relationships with your non-social media-using friends; they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on because you&#x27;re shouting into the void and they&#x27;re not in it, but you don&#x27;t actively talk to them because there&#x27;s this subconscious assumption that everyone Important to you sees your posts.
anyway. i&#x27;m pretty sure i think about social media more than the average person. i&#x27;m looking forward to never thinking about social media again.</span>

Introductions
Arvind: Hello, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about SIG Scheduling! Would you
like to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role, and how you got involved with
Kubernetes?
Kensei: Hi, thanks for the opportunity! I’m Kensei Nakada
(@sanposhiho), a software engineer at
Tetrate.io. I have been contributing to Kubernetes in my free time for more
than 3 years, and now I’m an approver of SIG-Scheduling in Kubernetes. Also, I’m a founder/owner of
two SIG subprojects,
kube-scheduler-simulator and
kube-scheduler-wasm-extension.

 “THOMAS PAINE … WAS NEVER ENOUGH of an optimist to let his natural anarchism run its full course.”[1] His contemporary, William Godwin, said in his “Enquiry Concerning Political Justice” (1793), “With what delight must every well-informed friend of mankind look forward to the dissolution of political government, of that brute engine which has been the only perennial cause of the vices of mankind … and no otherwise to be removed than by its utter annihilation.” Paine takes a more negative stance:— “Some writers have so confounded society with government as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only diff…</span>

 I used to think that anarchism was “just” a political philosophy. I was wrong. It is much, much more than that. 
 By political philosophy, I mean a way of thinking about politics, institutions and decision-making. How people arbitrate their business with one another, theories of government – or self-government – or the abolition of all hierarchy. I liked to boil down anarchism into a few pithy phrases like, “anarchism is about no one having power over anyone else.” 
 I was not wrong. Anarchism is indeed about all of these things. It is indeed a political philosophy. It is indeed about how people take decisions together and manage their affairs collectively. But I thought this was its philosophy in toto, that ther…</span>

Title: The Making of the Spanish CNT-IWA (2010–2024)
Date: September 21, 2024
Source: Retrieved on 23rd September 2024 from libcom.org

 It is about 7 years since the spanish CNT-AIT organisation came into existence. Despite its name, which claims a historical trajectory, it is a split from the CNT.

                              <span>Anecdotal, but it seems like all the people who “build in public” end up trapped by their chosen distribution strategy.
What I mean by this is, if you’re building in public there’s a 99% chance you’re going to end up building products for other indiehackers who are interested in following people who build in public.
This means you’re probably going to end up building yet another micro-Saas dev tool (Saas boilerplate, incident monitoring, etc) or growth hacking tool (for social media, SEO, cold email, AI content, etc).
And you’ll probably get modest success fast, since indiehackers like tools that help them indiehack and if they follow you on social media to hear stories of how they can get rich quick, they’ll definitely buy a product from you promising to help them do that.
However, I think you’ll struggle to ever “cross the chasm” so to speak into building a company that’s bigger than whatever online personality you build (no mass markets or low churn businesses without pyramid scheme dynamics).</span>

They not only make the patients life worse but the doctors and hospitals as well. Dealing with insurance means small practices need a dedicated office staff to file the right paperwork and get paid for each patient visit.</span>

                              <span>Nextcloud is a nightmare.
First if all, it wants to do everything and does none well (or better than specialized apps)
Its internals are a shitshow - a question about getting the real IP of the calling client raised a 10 pages discussion where people said &quot;it works&quot; and other days &quot;it does not&quot;. The &quot;solution&quot; required you to change a volatile setting within the docker container (and do it again when the container changes)
Finally the upgrade is insane. I once tried to upgrade my installation, was told that n+2 upgrades are not possible (fair enough) and ... the installer destroyed the database. What a piece of crap. Thanks god for backups.</span>

The fastest, least ad-filled and micropayment filled apps are usually the small ones.   By downloading a 3 megabyte thermometer app you&#x27;ll be much happier than a 150 megabyte thermometer app.</span>

                              <span>from Lars Syll Based on our interviews, heterodox economics appears to be a positive project, inevitably deﬁned somewhat in terms of the mainstream but not exhaustively so. It is also eﬃcacious, with policy and real-world impact. It is a complex object, not amenable to deﬁnition by a single criterion. Its dimensions are partly intellectual, in […]</span>

This add-on for the Bearming theme allows you to include buttons for emailing, printing, and sharing your blog posts on social media (see examples at the bottom of this page).
To use the add-on, which requires the latest version of the Bearming theme (1.3), add the code below to the end of your posts. If you prefer to avoid adding it manually each time, paste the code into your post template (Bear dashboard -&gt; Posts -&gt; Edit template).

mail Email
 print Print
 share Share


Then add the following style to your theme:
/* Share buttons */
.share {
  margin: 30px 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
}
.share li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 7px;
  line-height: 41px;
}
.share a {
  padding: 6px 10px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  text-decoration: none;
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
.share a:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.material-icons {
  font-family: &#x27;Material Icons&#x27;;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  vertical-align: text-top;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  font-feature-settings: &#x27;liga&#x27;;
}

That&#x27;s it! I hope your readers find this feature useful.

                              <span>One of the ways that I&#x27;m fortunate is that I enjoy simple pleasures the most. I have no need for elaborate, constant, and expensive variety to be satisfied. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t enjoy an occasional adventure—I do. It&#x27;s just that I am very happy to have a nice time in my own home, surrounded by the things I&#x27;ve already accumulated that bring me pleasure. It was only as a teenager that I felt that restless call to get out and get away from home to experience something besides the same old, same old.
Granted, our at-home entertainment choices today are much more varied than they were in the 70s and 80s when I was coming of age. I don&#x27;t have to spend an hour at the Record Bar to find new music. I enjoyed it then, but I also enjoy the way we discover music today. I&#x27;ve been to a few really enjoy…</span>

Thirty-one countries have either defaulted or have access to external financing suspended due to high debt levels. Even though external debt is crippling economies in the (...)

                              <span>This is so lost in Agile.
Engineers should get the time to “sand” their products, but we just don’t. If QA doesn’t make a ticket for the space between, it’ll never get fixed.
The customer probably notices this kind of a thing but it’s a miracle if the customer bothers to report it, and another miracle if it eventually turns into a ticket, and another miracle if someone prioritises it enough to spend time fixing it.
[In fact most companies have such opaque issue boards that as a customer I get so frustrated when I find a small issue or bug and have to spend like 50 hours back and forth to prove it’s a bug and actually get a ticket put in the tracker.]</span>

                              <span>I think this somewhat misses an important nuance. Japanese PCs had to be different early on because of the complexities of the written language. All of the important characters could be handled in just a few bits (7 or 8) and low resolution in Western markets, with different fonts and character maps dropped in to support a few different alphabets.
But in CJK countries, things were much harder and the entire I/O system had to be significantly more capable than what might pass for usable elsewhere. This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time. A common add-on was ROMs with Kanji (Chinese derived characters) support in the same way a person in the West might buy a …</span>

                              <span>Just adding a little bit of context about AT&amp;T: I collect used cell phones, erase them, unlock when possible, and distribute them to unhoused people through several local food shelves, which allows those people to access benefits, housing, health care, jobs, etc which would otherwise be out of reach. With AT&amp;T I can go to their website and unlock an old phone in minutes, allowing them to use a no-cost carrier like QLink Wireless.

I bought a new camera this week. Or, at least, a refurbished one, purchased on impulse as part of a mad scramble to fill my life with things to do that don&#x27;t involve looking at a computer.
This isn&#x27;t my first flirtation with photography. A brief obsession with the fantastic Umurangi Generation pushed me to pick up a cheap Centon df300 a few years back. I love film, I really do; the warm texture of shots, the ritual of getting it developed, the unpredictability of how things will turn out. But between the cost and time it took to see the results and the technical fussiness of keeping a decades-old handheld working, I slowly began to fall off.

                              <span>Today, 21 September, Sri Lanka will hold its first presidential election since the July 2022 popular uprising known officially declared the worst economic crisis in the country in 73 years. Most foreign debt repayments were suspended after two years of money printing to support tax cuts. The economy contracted 7.8% and the percentage of the population earning less than $3.65 a day doubled to around 25% of the population.

                              <span>I’m Hursh, cofounder and CTO of The Browser Company (the company that makes Arc). Even though no users were affected and we patched it right away, the hypothetical depth of this vulnerability is unacceptable. We’ve written up some technical details and how we’ll improve in the future (including moving off Firebase and setting up a proper bug bounty program) here: https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response.
I&#x27;m really sorry about this, both the vuln itself and the delayed comms around it, and really appreciate all the feedback here – everything from disappointment to outrage to encouragement. It holds us accountable to do better, and makes sure we prioritize this moving forward. Thank you so much.</span>
