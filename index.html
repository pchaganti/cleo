His subsequent public addresses to the NAACP convention and other venues fared  More

I swear I will never understand why Amazon&#x27;s supply, organization, and pricing for household goods is such a disaster.
Because their experience for mainstream books is mostly perfectly fine -- there&#x27;s a single listing for each book, and the price doesn&#x27;t change much, just some discount from list. It works.
But for things like paper towels or Tide or whatever, it&#x27;s utter chaos. Multiple listings for the same item, sizes and quantities that mysteriously move from one listing to another, prices that vary 10x or more...
It&#x27;s utterly baffling to me why Amazon created this consumer-hostile nightmare. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, but everything home and toiletries I buy from Target online, simply because the listings and prices are totally consistent. Even though I have Prime! I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon doesn&#x27;t figure out that Prime consumers like me buy from Target instead because Amazon&#x27;s household supplies listings are such utter unpredictable garbage, while Target just works like a normal store.</span>

                              <span>Users should never be expected to know these gotchas for a feature called &quot;private&quot;, documented or not. It&#x27;s disappointing to see GitHub calling it a feature instead of a bug, to me it just shows a complete lack of care about security. Privacy features should _always_ have a strict, safe default.
In the meantime I&#x27;ll be calling &quot;private&quot; repos &quot;unlisted&quot;, seems more appropriate</span>

                              <span>I reported this on their HackerOne many years ago (2018 it seems) and they said it was working as intended. Conclusion: don&#x27;t use private forks. Copy the repository instead.
Here is their full response from back then:
&gt; Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the finding we have determined it is a known low risk issue. We may make this functionality more strict in the future, but don&#x27;t have anything to announce now. As a result, this is not eligible for reward under the Bug Bounty program.
&gt; GitHub stores the parent repository along with forks in a &quot;repository network&quot;. It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository&#x27;s visibility changes (Eg. public-&gt;private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits/blobs from being readable via another network member.</span>

This is compounded by the multi-headed monster that large orgs like theirs have no choice but to become. If customers could trust that every day essentials had a relatively stable price and availability pattern like they trust from their local grocery store (rightly or wrongly), blind ordering might be more tenable.
But some other head on the beast wants to keep Amazon shaped like an unmonitored digital marketplace where orders are fulfilled dynamically by bidders and algorithms, so your Tide Pods could be anywhere from $6.99 to $64.99, and you might get anywhere between 10 and 100, and they might arrive tomorrow or next week, and they might come in retail packaging or as a bag of tide-pod-resembling-mystery-objects, etc.
Of course blind ordering won&#x27;t work when you can&#x27;t give your customers any  assurances (let alone guarantees) about price, quality, volume, etc</span>

                              <span>The core issue is that Amazon envisioned Alexa as a product that would help it increase sales. Smart home features were always an afterthought. How convenient would it be if people could shout &quot;Alexa order me Tide Pods&quot; from wherever they were in their home and the order got magically processed? That demo definitely got applause from a boardroom full of execs.
The problem is that consumers don&#x27;t behave like that. This is also why Amazon&#x27;s Dash buttons failed. I always want to see a page with the product details and price before I click &quot;buy&quot;. Reducing the number of clicks is not going to make me change my decision and suddenly order more things.
If they want to salvage Alexa, they need to forget shopping and start doubling down on the smart home and assistant experience. The tech is still pretty much where it was in 2014. Alexa can set timers and tell me the weather, and...that&#x27;s basically it. Make it a value add in my life and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying a subscription fee for it.</span>

Our editor-in-chief was interviewed for this related Nature article a couple months ago (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7).
While it’s easy pickings, it’s still always worth pointing out the hypocrisy of Nature publishing pieces like this, given that they are key drivers of this phenomenon by rarely publishing null results in their mainline journals. They are have extremely little incentive to change anything about the way scientific publishing works, as they are currently profiting the most from the existing structures, so them publishing something like this always leaves a bit of a sour taste.</span>

I briefly tried some things on a sideproject website of mine to get back into it, and it was like pulling teeth. I haven&#x27;t properly coded in months, so I am sure that adds to it, but there&#x27;s more to it.
I thought about it, and something else came to my mind. Years ago, I was teaching myself 3D modeling. For a few years, I had planned to get into game design as a prop artist and also applied to a university program centered on this. It needed a portfolio, so for three years I worked hard and got rejected each year because 600 people applied for 40 spots, haha.

                              <span>Why has NATO been so generally accepted in Europe by almost all the major political parties and especially puzzling, the social democratic ones? Its economic costs, illegal aggressive wars, environmental damage, and the risks of nuclear annihilation would seem to make it a prime platform item. Well-informed political activists are unlikely to believe that an invasion of Switzerland or Denmark is imminent. There are significant anti-NATO movements, such as No to War No to NATO, but so far they haven’t been able to turn the tide. More

                              <span>I opted out at Boston International Airport. It involved arguing with the TSA for about 5 minutes while holding up a 150 person line. Then the supervisor came over, told me that I &quot;was required to have to have my photo taken&quot; and opting out consisted of checking a box in the software to not save my photo. My alternative was to not get on the flight.
The whole idea of opting out is a scam. They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public.</span>

The interesting thing about geysers and pools is how relatively predictable they are... until they are not. A mathematical and statistical person would have a lot of fun building prediction models for all the different geysers.</span>

                              <span>&gt; We’re releasing Llama 3.1 405B, the first frontier-level open source AI model, as well as new and improved Llama 3.1 70B and 8B models.
Bravo! While I don&#x27;t agree with Zuck&#x27;s views and actions on many fronts, on this occasion I think he and the AI folks at Meta deserve our praise and gratitude. With this release, they have brought the cost of pretraining a frontier 400B+ parameter model to ZERO for pretty much everyone -- well, everyone except Meta&#x27;s key competitors.[a] THANK YOU ZUCK.
Meanwhile, the business-minded people at Meta surely won&#x27;t mind if the release of these frontier models to the public happens to completely mess up the AI plans of competitors like OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, etc. Come to think of it, the negative impact on such competitors was likely a key motivation for releasing the new models.

I find the language around &quot;open source AI&quot; to be confusing. With &quot;open source&quot; there&#x27;s usually &quot;source&quot; to open, right? As in, there is human legible code that can be read and modified by the user? If so, then how can current ML models be open source? They&#x27;re very large matrices that are, for the most part, inscrutable to the user. They seem akin to binaries, which, yes, can be modified by the user, but are extremely obscured to the user, and require enormous effort to understand and effectively modify.
&quot;Open source&quot; code is not just code that isn&#x27;t executed remotely over an API, and it seems like maybe its being conflated with that here?</span>

Six of them are still in operation today, manufacturing structural parts for military and commercial aircraft” [1].
$279mm in 1957 dollars is about $3.2bn today [2]. A public cluster of GPUs provided for free to American universities, companies and non-profits might not be a bad idea.

Because the stress and risks of running a small business as a solo inexperienced first time business owner are insane compared to a regular 9-5.
Especially if you start hiring other people, your liability then  increases 10 fold as now anything can happen with them (sick leave, absenteism, low performance, sabotage, etc) but you&#x27;re still bound to the same deadlines you agreed with your customers or you&#x27;ll get sued for damages by them.
As an employee you have some basic rights and protections from the state on the limits your employer can squeeze from you, more or less, depending on where you live. As a contractor or company however, you don&#x27;t, and can be fully liable in court for your failures to deliver regardless of your personal circumstances. Unless you know what you&#x27;re getting into and have the know-how, experience, or mentorship, it&#x27;s not worth it in most cases.</span>

                              <span>I woke up this morning with a sense of déjà vu.
My alarm hadn&#x27;t gone off yet, but I was already awake, rolling over in bed with a familiar sense of dread. The routine was the same: get ready for work, make coffee, and head to my home office to start the work day.
As I attended meetings, smiled for the camera, and updated my product roadmap for what felt like the millionth time, that same feeling stayed— I’ve done this before.
This feeling has been with me since yesterday, last week, months before, and maybe even longer. It’s like living in my own version of Groundhog Day1, where every day is identical to the day before.
I wake up too early (for me, at least)2, work all day, and by the end of my work day, I&#x27;m so drained (emotionally and mentally) that all I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep. The only break to this repetition is the weekends, and even then, I try not to think about work.
I can’t help but ask myself, is this really all there is to life?
Ugh, I think I just need a vacation.

A movie from 1993 where “A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.” I’m not narcissistic but I do feel like I’m stuck in some loop I want to break free from.↩

                              <span>I saw this really cool post on Twitter and thought I&#x27;d make my own version of it
Here&#x27;s my anti-resume,
I don&#x27;t specialise in any particular programming language. To me, languages are just syntax on top of ideologies and principles. I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the essence of programming itself.
I don&#x27;t follow clean code, I don&#x27;t follow any programming patterns. When I write code I only strive for simplicity.
I overvalue simplicity, to the point that I believe that its the most critical thing when it comes to software development. I don&#x27;t like it when I see python one-liner in a codebase
I write code because its fun. I don&#x27;t care a lot about how many people use the things I build. I build things simply because I love building things.
I love Lua, it&#x27;s beautiful. Again, I like simplicity in things, when I code in any other language, I usually use a subset of its features. I don&#x27;t like using iterators over loops, I don&#x27;t do operator overloading, I don&#x27;t like it when languages offer multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. This is also the reason I&#x27;m starting to like C.
I rely a lot on intuition.
I’m not a fan of TDD.
I value data structures over algorithms.
I don&#x27;t like Jira. I often end up not using it during projects. I don&#x27;t like Docker either, I try to avoid it whenever possible.
I prefer monoliths over microservices. While microservices can be useful, I think they are often misused.
I&#x27;m not very good at math. I need a pen and a paper whenever I encounter problems involving matrices, trigonometry, or anything beyond basic math
That&#x27;s it for now :)</span>

                              <span>On my history with sports betting.
Disclaimer: I am not a fan of gambling. I do not condone it. I do not recommend it. In fact, I believe online gambling and sports betting will irrevocably damage entire generations. I was terribly addicted and it really gave me bad thoughts all the time. Do not, do not gamble.
With that being said, I used to gamble, a lot. I started really young: when I was 11. It began innocuously with Team Fortress 2, betting in-game currencies like refined metals in raffle groups for larger prizes. I was on the edge of my seat for pennies. I never told my parents (hint: my family was poor). While this wasn&#x27;t particularly profitable, it was my introduction to the habit. Trading virtual items in Team Fortress 2 was more lucrative and in fact how I made most of my early s…</span>

Dans mon article précédent, j’ai constaté un malaise :
de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle m’ont déçu.
Je suis parti en envolées lyriques.
Maintenant, j’ai envie d’agir.
J’ai déjà commencé, en réalité,
depuis plusieurs semaines.
J’expérimente des trucs.
J’en ré-applique d’autres que j’avais laissés de côté.
Dans mes prochains articles,
je vais probablement me concentrer à nouveau
sur du plus &quot;jeu de rôle&quot;.
Mais j&#x27;ai l&#x27;intuition que parler de créativité en général,
ça apporte aussi quelque chose.
Me contenter de parler &quot;techniques de jeu de rôle&quot;,
c&#x27;est comme brûler une étape.
Donc... Je vais encore parler de moi.
(Et peut-être de toi)
On nous a tendu un piège
On va parler du circuit de la récompense,
de créativité, et de neurobullshi…</span>

That’s kind of insane to me, I was pretty sure no one was going to read this thing, and I’m still not 100% sure why people do. I’m just some person!! I didn’t think I had enough interesting things to say to warrant being read a thousand times, but it looks like you all disagree. So thank you to everyone who’s reading, I appreciate you being here!
Also, shout out to the person reading this blog from Fraidycat. I know someone is cool when they use Fraidycat.</span>

The only way to get Bernie Sanders’ “good friend” “Genocide Joe” Biden to give up his delegates and allow them to go to someone with (perhaps) a better shot at beating Adolph Trump (the man Trump’s 2024 vice presidential running mate JD Vance called “America’s Hitler” in 2016) was to praise the incumbent as “a man of great integrity with a long and noble record of service to America and humanity including his heroic defeat of Trump in the 2020 election.” More

                              <span>Far more likely is Google was not willing to complete the deal and was pulling the plug after looking at internal data. Wiz, fearing the bad press of Google backing out rushes to tell journalists that THEY are walking away because they are worth more.
Wiz&#x27;s valuation is insane. Most people havent even heard of them. I think it was a &gt; 60x ARR multiple on this deal. Id actually be kinda pissed if I was a google shareholder and they went through with it.
Something very strange is going on with Wiz. My gut tells me if they ever IPO to go big on puts.</span>

                              <span>&gt; As a designer, I feel the need to be original. If you’re a designer, or even if you’re just interested in design, you probably feel the need to be original, too.
I&#x27;ve been a professional designer since 2006, and I got over that thinking pretty quickly. A designer trying to be strikingly original is rarely acting in service of the design. If you want to be strikingly original, you probably want to be an artist instead of a designer. What a designer fundamentally does is communicate the best solution to a problem, given the requirements, goals, and constraints of that problem. Originality is subordinate to that at best.</span>

                              <span>A well known anecdote reported by Shannon:
&quot;My greatest concern was what to call it. I thought of calling it &#x27;information,&#x27; but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it &#x27;uncertainty.&#x27; When I discussed it with John von Neumann, he had a better idea. Von Neumann told me, &#x27;You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.&#x27;&quot;
See the answers to this MathOverflow SE question (https://mathoverflow.net/questions/403036/john-von-neumanns-...) for references on the discussion whether Shannon&#x27;s entropy is the same as the one from thermodynamics.</span>

Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be a minimum base level of support? Why do we keep moving the goal posts?
And if everyone quits their job and lives in a nice apartment, where is this money going to come from? The problem with welfare today is that its a disincentive to work. Start working, you lose your transfer payments. A lot of people are stuck in this trap and don&#x27;t want to start working, forsaking valuable on the job training and socialization that will hurt them in the long run.

If I&#x27;m scanning for something I copied into a folder yesterday amongst other things, I don&#x27;t want everything to show &quot;1 day ago&quot; if I&#x27;m looking for something I did around 11am. I want the dates and times. That goes for forums like HN. Show me the date/time and also &quot;7 hours ago&quot; or whatever if you have to.
I&#x27;ve never understood taking that information away. I wonder if it&#x27;s a consequence of infinite scroll or something.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Once Microsoft&#x27;s eBPF support for Windows becomes production-ready, Windows security software can be ported to eBPF as well.
This doesn’t seem grounded in reality. If you follow the link to the “hooks” that Windows eBPF makes available [1], it’s just for incoming packets and socket operations. IOW, MS is expecting you to use the Berkeley Packet Filter for packet filtering. Not for  filtering I/O, or object creation/use, or any of the other million places a driver like Crowdstrike’s hooks into the NT kernel.
In addition, they need to be in the kernel in order to monitor all the other 3rd party garbage running in kernel-space. ELAM (early-launch anti-malware) loads anti-malware drivers first so they can monitor everything that other drivers do. I highly doubt this is available to eBPF.
If Microsoft intends eBPF to be used to replace kernel-space anti-malware drivers, they have a long, long way to go.

                              <span>Spending it on other projects is a bad idea:
- it&#x27;d be distracting, they&#x27;re open source devs/maintainers not fund managers
- it could be divisive and they&#x27;d risk taking flak if they get it &quot;wrong&quot;
- it creates a class of &quot;approved&quot; clients and related projects
I think the Jellyfin team&#x27;s approach is pretty reasonable.
That said, if I was them I&#x27;d probably do what the Helix devs do [0] and rather than telling people to stop donating, remind them that donations are a &quot;tip&quot; to the project and shouldn&#x27;t be assumed to be buying you anything or paying to ramp up development (or marketing or anything else). I really appreciate that stance and their attitude that it&#x27;s great to have the money and they&#x27;ll spend it if and when they need it, while also encouraging people to consider donating elsewhere if they want to have a bigger impact.

most of all, i&#x27;d like to share with you some of the reasons i&#x27;ve found to love life through my 20s, and in doing so, inspire you to find happiness on your own journey.

                              <span>I&#x27;m drinking a very strong cup of coffee.
I&#x27;m back in my own apartment after being in the country again for the last few days. It&#x27;s nice to be around my own things and have some time to write some personal email letters, read blogs, journal, and be alone for a bit.
ideas/thoughts/reading:
-Working on a zine: Summer Diaries. This will be a short edition of maybe 20 copies. Tiny snippets about my country jaunts (written on my typewriter) with Polaroid pictures of said jaunts. Each copy will receive a different Polaroid from the zine. This project is born from wanting a more physical existence, a continuation of my quest for solid/analog experiences. A tangible proof of ordinary days.

                              <span>Back in early 2016 I had a medical emergency I never saw coming and had something happen to me that resulted in my having to take early retirement. Though I am thankful it wasn&#x27;t permanent retirement to the grave.
The event? My brain blew a gasket.
The event so powerful, I lost three days of my life and woke up in hospital wondering what the hell had happened. I can&#x27;t say I was scared at the time because I had no real idea of what happened or any memories of those lost days. I just woke up. A fact I am forever grateful for.
That medical emergency took me out for a whole year. I was laid up not really able to do much for a good few months. And then, slowly, bit by bit, I got back on my feet and tried to think about nothing else than what I was doing that day, and what I could look forward t…</span>

                              <span>A story of the time I got a disciplinary hearing after hacking into CMU&#x27;s dining system.
I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University last semester. It’s a modest school in the rust belt city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The CS department is renowned, and its PhDs are coveted.
Pittsburgh is a city past its prime, with abandoned steel mills as quaint witnesses to an older time. It&#x27;s citizens are resilient, enduring the constant rain and wind, trying their best to navigate life between Steelers&#x27; losses. Carnegie Mellon was founded by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie was a philanthropist, but also a terrible employer. And his employees were the type to be driven more by sheer necessity than ambition (to be fair, they were factory workers).
Similarly, CMU students are driven not by dreams of passion o…</span>

Why don’t they have an age limit on the president (or any elected office)?
E.g., you must be younger than the average life expectancy (currently men: 73yo / female: 79) - while in office.

                              <span>There&#x27;s at least five different things that went wrong simultaneously.
1. Poorly written code in the kernel module crashed the whole OS, and kept trying to parse the corrupted files, causing a boot loop. Instead of handling the error gracefully and deleting/marking the files as corrupt.
2. Either the corrupted files slipped through internal testing, or there is no internal testing.
3. Individual settings for when to apply such updates were apparently ignored. It&#x27;s unclear whether this was a glitch or standard practice. Either way I consider it a bug(it&#x27;s just a matter of whether it&#x27;s a software bug or a bug in their procedures).
4. This was pushed out everywhere simultaneously instead of staggered to limit any potential damage.
5. Whatever caused the corruption in the first place, which is anyone&#x27;s guess.</span>

Before College
I offered to produce a website for our local cinema; someone else won and produced this instead. Yes, it&#x27;s still like that today.

I self-studied 8 AP courses in a year; I didn&#x27;t actually study. I still sat through them. A single teacher supervised all of them; I told her I&#x27;m sorry I wasted her time.
I took the SAT once. Apparently you&#x27;re allowed to retake it. I bombed the PSAT the year prior. You get free scholarship money from that. I missed applying to scholarships too: sorry mom and dad.

I also wrote the rest of the buttplug.io docs but this is the part that I&#x27;m proudest of, both because I was really happy how it turned out and also because unlike the parts of the docs involving the API, this one doesn&#x27;t go out of date as quickly.

                              <span>&gt; various European nations [...] some immigrant groups
American Jew here, who spent years living in France and Spain. I&#x27;ve heard the same polite euphemisms refering to Arabs and Gypsies from the mouths of members of the Front National. You know, before 1945 it was said in Europe that Jews weren&#x27;t able to integrate fully with the host society.
One might ask: Was that the Jews&#x27; fault? Or the host society&#x27;s fault?
It&#x27;s a relevant question. You are blaming it on the particular group of migrants involved in the case of Europe right now. But historically Europe has ghettoized other groups.
When the US ghettoized Chinese economic migrants, American politicians claimed they could never integrate. And yet the Chinese-American population is well integrated and hugely successful since the host society allowed it. Same with Jews in America, and increasingly with Hispanics.
Why is it that economic migrants do, after a few generations, become successfully integrated in America, while they tend not to in Europe?
I don&#x27;t think the evidence definitively supports the conclusion that it&#x27;s down to which group. Europe has a problem with integration that has its roots in the ethnic character of its states (something America does not have), in deep-seated xenophobia that causes social exclusion of immigrant or out-groups, and in the fact that its states&#x27; reasons for existence are based on tribal boundaries and wars for territory rather than on achieving broader democratic and economic flourishing by harnessing the capability of the whole population. And thus Europe presents neither a dream of integration nor a path toward integration (as in, &quot;to become American&quot;; there is neither an equivalent aspiration nor option &quot;to become French&quot;). And then, once again, Europe blames the groups it refuses to accept.</span>

You may not be concerned about the crime, but many voters are. The author of the article you linked to also exhorts the Somali immigrant community to not engage in crime.
&gt; because that seems like a somewhat higher tendency until the 2nd and 3rd generation is able to make it into established society.
History and data from various European nations suggest that some immigrant groups aren&#x27;t able to integrate with the host society after multiple generations, and remain ghettoized with low employment and high crime rates (vastly higher than the native population, for certain categories of crime).
It&#x27;s clear that the national interest is in accepting skilled immigrants who migrate legally and are able to integrate fully into the host society, a la Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s dropping of the hyphen. It is not desirable to have separate ethnic groups who &quot;share the same language, culture and faith&quot; distinct from the mainstream.</span>

                              <span>When we released our open-source project[1], this hacker (Eva) pentested our project pretty extensively and was very professional in their disclosures. They didn&#x27;t even ask for a bounty since we didn&#x27;t have a program back then!
Eva is an incredibly gifted hacker and a responsible one, a16z should treat them better.

    &gt;    there was no available contact on their main site
    &gt;    the email i could find engineering@a16z.com bounced my emails

The age-old practice of screwing over security researchers over any possible technicality is still alive and well. Brings tears to my eyes.</span>

                              <span>Typst has been pretty amazing, and at my organization, we’re very happy with it. We needed to generate over 1.5 million PDFs every night and experimented with various solutions—from Puppeteer for HTML to PDF conversions, to pdflatex and lualatex. Typst has been several orders of magnitude faster and has a lighter resource footprint. Also, templating the PDFs in LaTeX wasn’t a pleasant developer experience, but with Typst templates, it has been quite intuitive.
We’ve written more about this large-scale PDF generation stack in our blog here: https://zerodha.tech/blog/1-5-million-pdfs-in-25-minutes</span>

                              <span>I love reading blog posts, and I also enjoy responding to them.  I enjoy writing blog posts, and getting replies.  It makes it more interesting.
However, comments are not for everyone, or every post.  Also, comments have traditionally opened up your blog to spammers.  It&#x27;s a balancing act.
Introducing Komments.cloud
Full disclosure -- I developed Komments to serve my own purposes but a few people then asked if they could use it, so I have opened it up to everyone.



Komments.cloud is an entirely separate website, but let&#x27;s call it a side-app 😏  It sounds nicer.
How does it work?  Simple:
Write your blog post as normal in Bear
Create an page in Komments.cloud for user comments
Add a link on your blog post to the unique address in Komments
Done
If anyone leaves a comment you must approve it before it is live.  Approving takes a few seconds.
There&#x27;s more detail here, and you can see it in action by clicking the comments link at the end of this blog post.
Works everywhere
You can use Komments anywhere, on any blogging/website that allows links (which is all of them basically).  Depending on what access you have to the blogging page code, you can even add buttons, or insert the Komments directing on the page.
Bear uses a simple link.  You can see how to do it at the bottom of the About page.
Video
Here&#x27;s a two minute video on how to add commenting to a Bear blog post.
Give it a go
Fancy trying it?  Have any thoughts?  Want to test it?
Oh, and it&#x27;s completely FREE.  No adverts, no tracking.  Just plain and simple good clean honest coding to help us all enjoy the web.

                              <span>Pour bien commencer ce blog, je vais faire un article égocentrique.
J&#x27;espère que parmi celles et ceux qui le liront,
il y aura quand même 2-3 &quot;pélo&quot; qui arriveront à s&#x27;identifier à mon ressenti.
Ces dernières années, j&#x27;ai mené de nombreuses campagnes de jeu de rôle.
Mais j&#x27;ai souvent été déçu.
Elles n&#x27;avaient pourtant pas de problèmes intrinsèques.
J&#x27;entends par là qu&#x27;a priori, je crois que les joueurs s&#x27;amusaient.
Je pense d&#x27;ailleurs que je m&#x27;amusais aussi durant la partie.
Bien sûr, tout n&#x27;était pas mémorable, tout ne se valait pas,
il y a eu des bonnes et des mauvaises rencontres,
mais j&#x27;estime que ces parties n&#x27;étaient pas &quot;mauvaises&quot;.
La déception dont je parle est plus personnelle.
Et elle va plus loin que la partie en tant que telle.

You NEED a Framework and there is no way around it!
Without one, you will remain stagnant at best!
You see, I finally figured out my health and fitness after many years. Over the years, I have jumped from one fad to the next, trying keto, intermittent fasting, low fat, high fat, you name it!
Additionally, I have found myself committing to a workout program for a few weeks only to switch it up on myself and try something else that seemed more exciting in the moment. Because of this constant change, very little progress was being made. In fact, I was simply maintaining at best!
Finally, I made a change to my way of thinking!

But as with any growing community, this hasn&#x27;t been without its own set of challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorised into 2 groups:
1. Spam blogs
Fighting spam is an ongoing battle, but mostly a solved problem. A combination of The Frustration Loop and the review process has taken care of it. However, due to a sharp increase in the number of signups recently (both legitimate and spam blogs), I&#x27;ve co-opted the help of Pam and Shraddha from Bonsai Digital to get through the never-ending stack of new blogs.
