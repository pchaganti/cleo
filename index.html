                              <span>If apple literally hadn&#x27;t won their own case 2 years ago you&#x27;d be right.
If the company that literally doesn&#x27;t allow users to install ANY application, yet alone a whole store, is in the clear, it&#x27;s mind boggling that Google&#x27;s situation is the one they took issue with.
Apple literally has a higher market share in the US.</span>

From Google&#x27;s reply (https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-...): &quot;These Epic-requested changes stem from a decision that is completely contrary to another court’s rejection of similar claims Epic made against Apple — even though, unlike iOS, Android is an open platform that has always allowed for choice and flexibility like multiple app stores and sideloading.&quot;</span>

Well, I guess Google&#x27;s market cap is only 2 trillion compared to Apple&#x27;s 3 trillion, so I guess that&#x27;s fair.</span>

                              <span>Ruby and Rails really seem to be going through a renaissance lately.
- The pickaxe book, Programming Ruby, has a new edition this year covering Ruby 3.3
- The Rails Way is being updated for Rails 8 and is available in pre-release, and will have two companion books
- A new title, Rails Scales, is being published by PragProg and is available in pre-release now
- YJIT has made Ruby fast. Like, _FAST_
- Rails has a bunch of new features that cover the &quot;missing middle&quot; levels of success
- Ruby has a bunch of new and new-ish features like Data (immutable Struct), pattern matching, Fibers and Ractors, and more.
I had largely moved on from ruby into the world of front-end applications by 2013, but now I&#x27;m excited about the prospects of diving back in.</span>

                              <span>This reminds me of exploits we used to do to arcade cabinets back in Sydney in the 80&#x27;s and 90s. The school gas heaters used to have what we called &quot;clickers&quot;, piezoelectric ignition devices you could remove from the heaters.
You then took that clicker to your local arcade, and clicked one of the corners of the CRT, that would send a shock through the system and add credits to your game. I believe this was because the CRT was grounded on the same ground lines that the mechanism for physically checking a coin had gone through the system.
Suffice to say, they caught onto this over time, and added some form of an alarm into it. But up until then... Those were truly the best times.</span>

                              <span>This is one reason I believe &quot;right to repair&quot; laws are so important. The environmental damage of producing the device is already done. Make it last as long as possible. Reduce, reuse... then recycle.
Re-using devices helps us also reduce the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we&#x27;re not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?
Never the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I&#x27;ve been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5&#x27;s, 7&#x27;s, and 8&#x27;s that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.
But tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I&#x27;ve been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It&#x27;s as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!
And pick up a new hobby if you are able. Support your local tech geeks if you can!</span>

                              <span>I cannot help but notice an even stronger trend of content creators abandoning any written expression, in favour of untamed video or audio streams.
One guy had a very cool blog about FIRE and abandoned it completely to devote himself to video streams and become an entertainer; a week ago, a software engineering blogger started focusing on a podcast and I&#x27;m afraid it will end up the same way.
Writing forces you to organise your thoughts, divide them up logically and tell a coherent story. Ideas become condensed and accessible. Also easier to discuss, update and comment. Usually, you can go back and re-read at any time, streamed content seems doomed to be a one-off.
Of course reading is cognitively more demanding, but it is also the better option for learning and memory recognition. Not advocating against low-attention means of communication, but if the content is supposed to be educational, written content should be the default (possibly complemented by other mediums).
One annoying thing is the asymmetrical nature of time between creator and listener. When you write an article, you invest X time in writing it, but it only takes ~X/10 time to read it. It takes effort, but it pays off in terms of quality, while providing the best time-to-content ratio for the reader.
On the other hand, producing a video stream requires little effort and takes about the same time as the stream itself, but forces the watcher to invest much more time, while retaining less information.
While I cannot deny the power of videos to reach a wider audience, I wish they would more often consider the old-fashioned, forum-nostalgic boomers. These folks like to read ideas summarised in nice blog articles :)
P.S.: This article could have been a 20 minute video on YouTube or a 30 minute podcast, shall I switch?</span>

                              <span>&quot;But I don&#x27;t know what to blog about.&quot;
I often hear that. Friends and acquaintances who know that I blog, and who are eager to start themselves, but don&#x27;t know what to write about. My answer is always the same:
&quot;Blog your way to the answer.&quot;
We can sit and ponder for eternity without coming to an answer. Or the answer might come to us in theory, but in practice it quickly turns out to be a false or misleading answer.
Blog, blog, blog – that&#x27;s the solution.
We might come to realize that we don&#x27;t need to blog about anything in particular. The writing becomes a meditation, and that rewarding sense of satisfaction is all we need.
Or maybe we&#x27;ll realize that blogging isn&#x27;t our thing at all. Then at least we&#x27;ve tried and gotten a truthful answer, and we didn&#x27;t waste our time ruminating about it.
The only direction I had when launching this blog was that it should be in English. It&#x27;s still a bit all over the place in terms of content, and might continue to be so. But lately, something of a concept has been tapping me on the shoulder from time to time.
Many of the posts here are about writing, blogging, and inspiration. These are things I&#x27;m really passionate about and love to share. Something that also permeates this blog&#x27;s small side projects, such as the Bearming Theme and the Blog Inspiration section.
Who knows, maybe these will become the main focus of this blog someday. I don&#x27;t have anything concrete planned, but this idea keeps coming up more often. I’m mainly mentioning it is yet another good example of how this idea came about:
Through blogging. Not through considering blogging.</span>

                              <span>In the modern Internet era, where our interactions with other people can be primarily or exclusively online, I&#x27;ve stopped distinguishing between IRL and online human beings. You are all real people to me. In my professional life, a good portion of my customers are voices on the telephone or composers of emails. My job is to solve problems for those people and their very real issues. Lots of times, but not always, I get a verbal or written &quot;thanks&quot; for helping them out, but I&#x27;d help them even if all I got was silence. People with good manners are a bonus.
Even with folks I first met by sharing the same physical space, most interactions tend to come through a computer monitor or cell phone screen. This includes my own flesh and blood. I see more pictures of my grandchildren on Facebook than …</span>

Various approaches have been employed, utilizing firm-level emissions data, financial market data (from equity and derivatives markets), or textual data. Focusing on the latter approach, we conduct descriptive analyses of six text-based climate risk indices from published or well-cited papers. In this blog post, we highlight the differences and commonalities across these indices.</span>

                              <span>Since discovering my favorite types of blog posts are essay-like in anatomy and length, I&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of time to both writing and reading such posts. Every morning, before I go on my phone and while I drink my coffee, I&#x27;ll hop onto Bear Blog and start writing. About what? Well, anything! Usually, the first topic that pops into my head is the one I&#x27;ll write about, and I can usually pop out a decently sized post within an hour. I have the luxury of working from home and my classes are all later than 10am, so I&#x27;ve really enjoyed crafting this relaxing and productive morning routine for myself. I don&#x27;t always post what I write, but I always make sure to write every day, if only for a few minutes.
When I post something in the morning, I&#x27;ll check back periodically to reread my post or look at the toasts. I don&#x27;t have an email attached to this account as of yet, so the only feedback I get on the site (or evidence that my post reached anyone at all) is from the toasts. Seeing the number tick up can really make my day when it&#x27;s a post I spent a lot of time on, or if it covers a subject I care about. I want to attach more functionality to my blog that makes it easier for people to reach me and interact with my writing, but I&#x27;ve also really enjoyed feeling like typing in this little blue box is something I only do for me. I feel really good after blogging, and I don&#x27;t ever want that to change.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sitting at one of my favorite coffee shops here in Stockholm. A friend reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. She was just about to meditate first.
I&#x27;ve meditated myself in periods. I&#x27;m actually doing it right now. The meditation I practice is called writing.
Few things in life make me as present in the moment as writing. I&#x27;ve tried different types of meditation, gone on retreats around the world, read books on the subject, done online courses, tested various apps... Nothing has come close to the mindful presence I experience while writing.
Am I saying that traditional meditation is bad? No, of course not. I still do it myself occasionally, and I know that my dear friend finds it incredibly rewarding and valuable.
What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;technique&quot; isn&#x27;t so important. The important thing is that it aligns with what suits us, whether it means sitting cross-legged or being out in the woods picking mushrooms.
If meditation becomes something that &quot;should be done&quot; - a task, an achievement - how much do we really get out of it? One conscious breath can be more precious than spending 30 minutes checking off the task &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the to-do list.
I leave you with that to meditate on.</span>

                              <span>There arent any alternatives for major catastrophes that can top amplitude modulated radio.
if you are in a car fleeing for your life from a wildfire, major storm, or war, AM radio is available sometimes hundreds of miles from your location to provide timely instruction and lifesaving updates. if you need electricity for a radio, your car has fuel and can provide a radio signal to you for quite some time.
AM radio can be transmitted with a roll of wire and a relatively simple transciever from an FOB or refugee camp. digital radio requires codecs, licenses, and specialty equipment. Satellite radio may, or may not be available as the ground stations that power it require even more advanced transcievers and software to operate and could take months to repair if attacked or destroyed. Cellular towers require special beamforming antenna that can take months to rebuild or procure in an emergency and rely on an advanced system of transcievers and software to provide a signal.
its not Dolby quality, but if you need clean water and shelter it will guide you. Arguably you could mandate a VHF receiver in every car for FM based NOAA/EAS alerts, but AM is still cheaper.</span>

I think this part is perhaps the silliest part of a very silly article. If you really like to put in a minimal effort then why on earth would you use Rust? If you want efficiency, memory management and a compiled modern language just use Go. Then you won’t even need anything but the standard library for what you want to do. Or… use Django as you suggest?
Yes, yes we use Rust in production because we thought it would be easier (well safer) to teach to interpreted language OOP developers than c/c++ but why on earth would you ever use it for the web unless you are a member of the cult?</span>

                              <span>With the world at war, the feeling that the international system has failed humanity is increasing. The challenges posed to international law and the United Nations are structural—a minority of violent, militarized governments dictate the terms and play by their own rules. But can the will of the majority result in real change?

I detest email spam and have been looking into tried &amp; true solutions for obfuscating email addresses. Contact forms are great for hiding email addresses, but I don&#x27;t love relying on yet another service for something so simple as email.
It turns out a simple CSS &quot;display: none&quot; blocks 100% of spam! I&#x27;ll be using this method to list my email address moving forward — you can see how it looks on my About page.
The symbol substitution method seems to still be effective, but I want my email address to be easy to copy-paste.
Here are the HTML and CSS snippets for anyone interested in hiding their email address from spam bots.
HTML for email address
Add this to where you want your email to display. Update username and domain.com with your actual information.
username@mail.domain.com

Theme CSS
span.email b {
    display: none;
}</span>

Do you want to keep the upvote button on your Bear blog but find it stressful to see how many people have liked, or haven&#x27;t liked, your posts?
Say hello to the &quot;unlikely&quot; button. It works like the standard button but doesn&#x27;t display the upvote count. No more sleepless nights worrying about your post&#x27;s popularity, but still keeping that trending post dream alive.
In your Beraming Theme, simply replace the current button with the following styles:
/* Unlikely button */
.upvote-button svg,
.upvote-count {
  display: none; 
}
button.upvote-button { 
  display: block !important;
  padding: 4px 9px;
  font-family: var(--font-secondary);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--link-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--link-color);
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.upvote-button::before {
  content: &quot;☆ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button::after {
  content: &quot;Like it?&quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::before {
  content: &quot;★ &quot;;
}
.upvote-button[disabled]::after {
  content: &quot;Thank you!&quot;;
  cursor: default;
}
.upvote-button.upvoted {
  color: var(--link-color) !important;
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
.upvote-button:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent-color);
}

Title: Black and Red Rags
Date: 3 Oct 2024
Source: https://ignitedindark.wordpress.com/2024/10/03/black-red-rags/

 For me, I take the black rag over the red rag because I refuse to spill my blood for the right to be a worker, and instead practice negativity against every parcel of the world we have known for generations. 
 The black rag represents fighting spirit, critical self-thought and innovative audacity. The red rag represents a conservative principle of Work taken to its most political extreme wherein workers own and police their own sorrow. The red rag means sacrifice for the re-constitution of sacrifice for the economy and politics. The black one cannot soundly be joined with the red. 
 The black rag represents the potent intellect of midnight fury which prefaces…</span>

Preface
 18th March 2019 Heval Tekoşer Piling fell şehîd in battle
 in Baghouz Fawqani, in Deir Ezzor region. 
 He was a great friend to all of us and an incredibly brave soldier.
 From Afrin to Deir Ezzor, he was always the last to leave. 
 We all carry the legacy of struggle from past times.
 Realizing our connection to our history and to fallen comrades
 gives us strength in present day.

Title: Communizing Society With Consumer Cooperatives

 Within anarchist circles, there is a split between those who advocate markets and those who advocate forms of decentralized planning such as participatory economics or federated communes. While the work of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek has pointed out the numerous issues with centralized state planning, much of the same criticisms can apply to decentralized planning as well. Decentralized planning attempts to avoid the knowledge problem by including participation from both producers and consumers directly in the planning process rather than relying on centralized planners to make decisions on their behalf. While worker cooperatives…</span>

Title: Feet On The Ground!

 When I first started my journey as an anarchist, I was incredibly privileged in both my environment and upbringing. I had grown up in a very upper-middle class suburb, neither knowing economic struggle nor of want when it came to my basic needs. I was, at that point in my life, a young 20 year old ‘man’ living with their parents as I started my doomed college career. That was when I got into the package industry. 
 Being a warehouse worker within the package industry was the most radicalizing job you could have given me. The sheer amount of naked disregard for safety and the well-being of my…</span>

                              <span>Hey: it&#x27;s this story again. As someone who&#x27;s around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I&#x27;ve always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama&#x27;s sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also:
* I went to university and had a great time there
* I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly.
* I talk to women and have had romantic relationships.
* I&#x27;ve had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software.
* While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I&#x27;d say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.
I know DMD severity varies between patients, but I don&#x27;t want this article to discourage people with DMD or with children that have DMD. It can be tough, but I think that modern treatments allow us to lead fairly rich lives outside of Warcraft.</span>

                              <span>FWIW Jeffrey Zeldman is a living legend. He was one of the first print designers to transition to the web, did it well, and wrote about it constantly. He designed the “Batman Forever” website in 1995; it was visited by something like one-third of all Internet users.
He created the Web Standards Project, hugely influential in getting browser manufacturers to support standards rather than pee in the pool. And if you think cross-browser support today is rough, at the time you could reliably crash production browsers with valid CSS.
Never mind A List Apart, one of the best early mailing lists on the web, a kind of transitionary form between Usenet and forums/Discord. And A Book Apart, which published lots of high-quality stuff.
If you develop for the web today, every time a browser behaves as the spec describes, thank Jeffrey Zeldman.</span>

                              <span>To recap OpenAI&#x27;s decisions over the past year:
* They burned up the hype for GPT-5 on 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can&#x27;t quickly replicate.
* They dissolved the safety team.
* They switched to for profit and are poised to give Altman equity.
* All while hyping AGI more than ever.
All of this suggests to me that Altman is in short-term exit preparation mode, not planning for AGI or even GPT-5. If he had another next generation model on the way he wouldn&#x27;t have let the media call his &quot;discount GPT-4&quot; and &quot;tree of thought&quot; models GPT-5. If he sincerely thought AGI was on the horizon he wouldn&#x27;t be eyeing the exit, and he likely wouldn&#x27;t have gotten rid of the superalignment team. His actions are best explained as those of a startup CEO who sees the hype cycle he&#x27;s been riding coming to an end and is looking to exit before we hit the trough of disillusionment.
None of this is to say that AI hasn&#x27;t already changed a lot about the world we live in and won&#x27;t continue to change things more. We will eventually hit the slope of enlightenment, but my bet is that Altman will have exited by then.</span>

                              <span>So, it&#x27;s been a while. Where do I start?
Let’s start at the beginning.
I’ve been writing for most of my life. As a kid, I wrote stories, though they never went beyond a few pages. I even started a neighborhood newspaper, but that didn’t last long. I wrote about football matches during big tournaments like the World Cup, but once the tournament ended, so did my writing. Not that I felt really sad about that, by the way. Most of the time I was glad it was over, because I could finally stop the forced writing.
I also wrote for a fairly big gaming website for a couple of years, but I always dreaded writing long reviews. Enjoyment was far away.
Then, in June of this year, I rediscovered my love for writing — this time, on my personal blog. I found a community of fellow writers on Mastodon and r…</span>

                              <span>At a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump invoked a chilling convergence of law, order, and violence—a cornerstone of what can only be described as his politics of disposability. By referencing The Purge, a dystopian film where the government legalizes all forms of violence, including murder, for 12 hours, Trump escalates his rhetoric to a dangerous metaphor. In his hands, “the purge” becomes more than just a narrative device; it embodies a vision in which state-sanctioned violence reaches its grotesque climax. More

                              <span>Sorry time: years ago I worked on a telemedicine web app before telemedicine was nearly as popular as it is today. Part of the application had patients filling out questionnaires online to show answers to the doctors. We were onboarding different parts of a large healthcare system throughout all this (cardio, GI, etc.) and each had questionnaires that required different logic for when and how to display the questions, so the application had a fairly powerful system for driving the conditional logic of when questions do and do not show up.
Well one day I am working on a new set of features to help support the new clinic that’s coming online and for whatever reason the question that should by all rights show up, does not. As I am getting deeper into debugging why, I pepper the code with nonsensical and slightly angry debug statements that show up alongside the questions. After solving the problem I happily clean up and commit the fixed code and move onto the next thing.
Well, it turns out I didn’t clean up all the debug statements. The statement I left in said I SEE YOU!!! in big red letters if you answered a particular set of questions in a particular way. This was discovered by a patient. Of the psychiatric clinic that just came online. On the questionnaire meant to evaluate paranoia.
Since then I have started using things like aaa and 111 as my debug markers.</span>

                              <span>Since Robert Birming released his Timeline design, I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and including it in some of my pages.
But I was also curious on how I could include it to make a microblog out of a typical Bearblog. Not that you can&#x27;t make short posts on here in a default look, but most of the design of Bearblog and its themes is decidedly for longform content. I wanted something that looks more like a microblogging/short post platform.
&#x3D;&#x3D;Some goals I had in mind for my own microblog:&#x3D;&#x3D;
I didn&#x27;t want these low effort posts to be in the Discovery section; make_discoverable has to be false in the Post preset.
The posts need to mention when they were made; I need to include {{ post_published_date }} in the h4 of the Timeline code.

                              <span>When I was a child, I grew up in a hoarder home. My mother had me at 16. We lived with my grandmother and her then wife, who kept everything she ever received. I have vivid memories of two things in that house.
The first is the kitchen table. There were no chairs around the table, it was never used to eat meals. Instead it was filled to the edges with things left unused.
 

The second was the piano. It was old, out of tune. The wood was peeling and no one in the home knew how to play the instrument. It sat in the front of the house and I was the only one to ever touch it. Like the table, the top of the piano was a menagerie of unwanted items and dust. I would toy around on it, pressing the keys down and creating out of tune melodies that have been lost to time.
 

When I was 11, my mother …</span>

                              <span>I do MRI work, and my gut is that none of the claims about dance vs. exercise would replicate. The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors&#x27; behavioral data doesn&#x27;t show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...
The brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I&#x27;m referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don&#x27;t reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors&#x27; claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p &#x3D; .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p &gt; .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.
In general, my priors on &quot;we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period&quot; are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.</span>

Just so happens that the &quot;love centre&quot; is also the &quot;vomiting centre&quot; along with a load of other stuff. I&#x27;d treat this hand-wavy claim with the same kind of skepticism - your counter-example is an excellent one. I agree that looking at a phone first thing in the morning is a bad idea, but for very different reasons.</span>

On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”
This is interesting to me. It does make some evolutionary sense but at the same time, i wake up every morning and look at my girlfriends face, hopefully that does not subconsciously trigger the same response.
That said,  the &quot;sky before screens&quot; idea has been rummaging in my mind since i first heard about it https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/sky-before-screens-has-ma...</span>

                              <span>Hi Matt, great that you&#x27;re participating here and I&#x27;m broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine&#x27;s conduct.
However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites.
To be entirely blunt it&#x27;s all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it&#x27;s because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance.
If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE&#x27;s conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It&#x27;s not going to go away on its own.</span>

                              <span>Matt - i&#x27;m not your lawyer, but you should shut up.
Employers generally have an obligation to keep personal data confidential, especially sensitive information like a job application.
Whether that applies in this particular case or not, i&#x27;m not going to offer an opinion, but you really should shut up.
I get that it&#x27;s particularly frustrating and hard to feel like you are being unfairly treated or whatever, but shut up anyway.</span>

                              <span>Connectome-adjacent neuroscientist here. Definitely not a dead end! But also definitely not the whole picture.
One of the main open questions in neuroscience right now is how network structure, dynamics, and function are related in the brain. Connectomes provide tremendous insight into structure, but as mentioned this does not generically solve either the dynamics or function problem. For example, for many of these neurons we don&#x27;t have a good understanding of their input-output relationship, and the nature of this relationship can strongly affect the dynamics that emerge in a highly connected network. Individual variability across connectomes, and how connectomes change over development are also a significant issue, but at least for the fly it&#x27;s thought that many of the basic structures are pretty conserved across adult animals, even if many of the details could differ.
Modulo these caveats, knowing the physical network structure of the brain does still impose huge constraints on what kinds of models we should be using for gaining insight into dynamics and function. For example, there are well known areas (the &quot;mushroom bodies&quot;) with specific feed-forward connectivity patterns that are very different from a random recurrent network. Further, there are at least some areas in the fly brain where we think there are indeed quite clean structure-function relationships, e.g. in the central complex of the fly brain, which contains a physical ring of neurons and is thought to support a &quot;bump&quot; of activity that acts as a sort of compass that helps flies navigate via a ring-attractor-like dynamical system. Thus, even though it has many missing pieces, a wiring diagram like this can be tremendously useful for generating hypotheses to guide more targeted experiments and theoretical studies.</span>

                              <span>Always cool to see new mutex implementations and shootouts between them, but I don’t like how this one is benchmarked. Looks like a microbenchmark.
Most of us who ship fast locks use very large multithreaded programs as our primary way of testing performance. The things that make a mutex fast or slow seem to be different for complex workloads with varied critical section length, varied numbers of threads contending, and varying levels of contention.
(Source: I wrote the fast locks that WebKit uses, I’m the person who invented the ParkingLot abstraction for lock impls (now also used in Rust and Unreal Engine), and I previously did research on fast locks for Java and have a paper about that.)</span>

The house I grew up in had an HOA. You could tell that the neighborhood had an HOA because our neighborhood was the typical-ish middle class cul-des-sac neighborhood. It was surrounded by a huge man-made pond that was well kept, with a park that got upgraded throughout the years. It used to be an orchard that became what it is today. As far as I knew, there were no strict rules enforced by our HOA. I&#x27;m assuming the money went to the upkeep of that pond and park, and little things around the neighborhood.
When I bought my first house in 2012, that house also had an HOA. The fees were super minimal, and I paid once a year. Th…</span>

Already trying to figure out when we can go again to continue exploring since we didn&#x27;t get a chance to do the Fairy Tale Houses tour.
Thankfully walking around town was a fairy tale in itself.



There were a ton of cute alleyways like this.

One of the libraries we visited so I could sign up for a library card to add to my collection.

Here&#x27;s another library. Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t go inside to get a library card here.

Plenty of artwork gems to discover like this.

and this.

We event found a nice little dog shop where we almost bought a bag for Cocoa.

                              <span>The 2024 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2024. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.
