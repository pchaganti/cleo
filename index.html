The trouble is they&#x27;re endlessly creative about the lists they put you on. I&#x27;d get one email from &quot;Alumni Connections&quot; and then another from &quot;Faculty Spotlight&quot; and then another from &quot;Global Outreach&quot; and then another from &quot;Event Invitations, 2023 series&quot;. I&#x27;m making those names up because I forget exactly what they were called, but you get the idea. I hope this was in violation of the regulation: surely you can&#x27;t invent a new mailing list that didn&#x27;t used to exist, add me to it, and require me to unsubscribe from it individually.
They finally stopped after I sent them an angry email.</span>

                              <span>When people try and say that regulating stuff like this is impossible, I often think about how unreasonably great the regulations around “Unsubscribe” links in emails are.
There really seems to be no loophole or workaround despite there being huge incentive for there to be one. Every time I click an “Unsubscribe” link in an email (it seems like they’re forced to say “Unsubscribe” and not use weasel words to hide the link) I’m either immediately unsubscribed from the person who sent me the email, or I’m taken to a page which seemingly MUST have a “remove me from all emails” option.
The level of compliance (and they can’t even do malicious compliance!) with this is absurd. If these new rules work anything like that, they’ll be awesome. Clearly regulating behavior like this is indeed possible.</span>

Hello! A Youtube video essayist I follow on Bluesky (Big Joel if you know of him) posted this:
“How do you become a person who just really likes doing work? I thought having a very interesting job would do it but this has not paid off as you might expect”
The first two people I thought of who give me the impression they enjoy their jobs are you and Bruno Dias, so I was wondering if you had an answer for this (because I sure don’t!)
I was slightly taken aback by this, as one often is when one sees one&#x27;s name in print unexpectedly, and I had to pick apart a little this idea that I give the impression that I enjoy my job.
I certainly have talked very positively about my work in public; I believe most readers should be familiar with the old (but…</span>

                              <span>I used to be obsessed with timelines.
When I was young and naive, I had a list of things I wanted to accomplish by specific points in my life. Some of those goals included:
Five years after earning my degree, I should be making a certain amount of money.
By 25, I should be engaged, and shortly after, should be married.
By a certain age, I should have a specific number of children.
Before that, I should own a particular kind of house in a specific location.
And so on, and so on.
Life is a fickle thing. I was young and didn’t fully grasp that wanting to achieve something by a certain time didn’t guarantee I would actually do it then.
Having a goal was good for me. During those 5 years, I worked really hard to reach a specific point in my career to hit that number. What was not helpful was be…</span>

                              <span>The other day, someone pointed out that I had lost weight.
I said that it&#x27;s a matter of perspective – and I didn&#x27;t mean that I look extra slim from a certain angle.
It&#x27;s true I&#x27;ve lost weight compared to six months ago. However, someone who hasn&#x27;t seen me in two years might say I&#x27;ve gained weight, which is also true from that perspective. The bigger picture, literally.
Opposites, yet both true.
We often overlook this paradox when judging ourselves, don&#x27;t we? We look back six months and see setbacks rather than successes. But if we widen our perspective and look back a couple of years, we&#x27;ll likely discover we&#x27;ve made significant progress.
Every setback holds considerably more successes.

Bullying Health
Elena Hagopyan
 As soon as you got any “bigger” health problem, you’re basically in trouble, not only by the things you’re facing by your condition, but actually the opinion is far harder. Today it is better to be some picture perfect child, young person or adult, as otherwise, you will be looked down upon by others. The silly of it is the fact no one is picture perfect, everyone who seems this way, it is just an act.

Condemned and Hated
Isis Nelson
 Adults have consistently ignored young opinions and voices forever. It’s taught to us that we should respect our elders, because they’re old, and not speak unless spoken to by an adults. They constantly fail to protect and help us. The history of our world is filled with young people and children being failed by adults and losing their rights. From birth, we’re told that we are inherently inferior. Year after year, young people’s ideas are shot down by older relatives, older siblings, teachers, professors, leaders, bosses, etc. Our ambitious, often progressive, ideals and value…</span>

 The anarchist movement in the United States has had the support of leading libertarian intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky; but it has lacked a figure who could transform its guiding principles into something resembling a political movement. In the autumn of 2011, David Graeber seemed to be the man who could drag anarchism into mainstream politics. 
 Graeber, along with other leading figures in the Occupy movement, coined the term ‘we are the 99 percent’. The catchphrase caught on, and within weeks — with the assistance of social media — Occupy transformed a small group of idealists…</span>

Qalandar Bux Memon: Can you explain why you support horizontal organisation, collective assemblies and a dialogical method for organising for social change as opposed to the vertical left party?
 David Gaeber: I like to make the distinction between forms of organization that could exist outside structures of coercion – that is, in the absence of any ability to call up men armed with weapons to threaten anyone who refuses to go along with a decision – and those which could not. It seems to me it’s the responsibility of those who are trying to create a free society to do so through forms of organization that cou…</span>

 David Graeber is an anthropologist and a well-known anarchist figure. He was one of the initiators of the Occupy movement in 2011. He is the author of a major essay, Debt, the First 5,000 Years. I met him in Paris for the release of his latest book, The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy.
Back in 2011, you were among the initiators of the Occupy movement. Several similar social movements have happened ever since, but it seems none of them managed to stay alive long enough to reach their…</span>

 David Graeber: It’s not really Yale’s leadership so much as the Department of Anthropology and senior faculty who decided to cut me off. For a long time I really tried to avoid getting involved in campus politics. I thought that I had come up with a nice formula, that I would be an activist in New York and simply a scholar here in New Haven. 
 Generally speaking, the academy really doesn’t care what you say and think or what you write, so long as you don’t do anything. If you’re willing to be a hypocrite, they’re fine with you, whatever you espouse. On the other hand, if there’s any sign that you might actually liv…</span>

On December 16, 2011, Ross Wolfe interviewed David Graeber, Reader at Goldsmiths College in London, author of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology (2004), and central figure in the early stages of the #Occupy Wall Street Movement. What follows is an edited transcript of the interview.

 In his latest book, David Graeber, the best-selling author of Debt: The First 5000 Years, argues that many jobs today are essentially pointless — or, as the book’s title calls them, Bullshit Jobs. 
 Jacobin Radio’s Suzi Weissman sat down with Graeber to find out what bullshit jobs are and why they’ve proliferated in recent years. 
A Taxonomy
Suzi Weissman: Let’s just get right down to it. What is the definition of a bullshit job? 
David Graeber: A bullshit job is a job which is so pointless, or even pernicious, that even the person doing the job secretly believes that it shouldn’t exist. Of course, you have to pretend…</span>

 In a compelling new book of essays entitled The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy, the American anarchist, and anthropologist, David Graeber argues that in all western countries today bureaucracy—whether it comes from multinational corporations or government offices— informs almost every single aspect of both public and private life.

Editor’s Note: Conservative proponents of the guaranteed income want a lump sum payment (Charles Murray suggests about $11,000 to all adults) to replace existing social welfare programs and downsize American bureaucracy. But some leftists oppose those government welfare agencies, too, London School of Economics professor David Graeber says. The leftist critique of private and public bureaucracies, Graeber explains, is that they “employ thousands of people to make us feel bad about ourselves.” 
 Bureaucrats pushing paper decide what we and our work are worth. But somewhat ironically, Graeber suggests, it’s those bu…</span>

 David Graeber, a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, is a man who wears many hats. He’s an academic, of course — and a respected one at that. But he’s also an author, an activist and political anarchist. But his most unique attribute may be this: He’s an honest-to-God public intellectual in an era when such figures are few and far between. 
 Graeber proved as much with “Debt: The First 5000 Years,” his ambitious tour de force overview of the role debt has played throughout the history of civilization and into the present day. And while it ma…</span>

                              <span>This year I started my magister degree in programming, and it fucking sucked from the very beginning of the bachelors, to be honest. I constantly regret &quot;my&quot; choice (my dad is a programmer, and I sorta wanted to make him proud, but there was no pressure from him or anybody else) to start all this. I long for history, literature, philosophy, languages and human psychology constantly. I try to self-study some of this, but university studying takes most of my time and mental capacity. IT just feels like it is not for me. I want to understand our situation as humans on this tiny planet. I feel this void inside of me every day. I feel like this year I will eventually fail my studies due to numerous mental breakdowns. Fuck it, I will be someone else in the end.</span>

                              <span>Some people are great at giving gifts. The kinds of gifts that squeeze your heart make you feel seen. I&#x27;m trying to become one of those people, but my friend Simon already is.
If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;re probably aware that I run a blogging platform that I care for deeply. And it&#x27;s the main thing I speak about when someone asks after my day. I rattle on about a challenging bug I&#x27;m trying to squash, complain about cheeky script-kiddies rattling the latches on all the doors and windows looking for an exploit, or mention an email I received from a blogger letting me know they see the love and effort I put into my work.
Simon hears all of this, and on my 32nd birthday gave me a gift that really hit home.
I keep a mostly-up-to-date list of nice messages about Bear that I&#x27;ve received from users over the past few years. It helps me remember why I do what I do, and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy whenever I need some extra motivation.
Knowing this, Simon conspired with a friend who owns a 3D printer and designed and created a little desktop bear that can hold a message board. He then wrote each of these messages out by hand (suffering only minor carpel tunnel) on sticky notes which the bear now carries like a human bear directional.

It now sits on my desk, next to my computer where I get to see it every work day, right when and where I need a shot of good vibes.
These are the kinds of gifts I want to learn how to give. Ones that make the receiver feel like they&#x27;ve been listened to and understood. That don&#x27;t cost much money but are priceless at the same time.
I&#x27;m grateful and inspired. Thanks Simon (I know you&#x27;re subscribed to my blog). And thanks to everyone who has sent me a kind email over the past few years. I appreciate you all.

                              <span>When it comes to having an opinion, every cornerstone of a community becomes a droughtless wellspring. No matter where you go, opposing arguments will follow. That is the nature of opinions—there will always be one slightly different from another. Amazingly, even in areas where opinions shouldn’t take precedence over fact, people will still hold their personal beliefs over them. I think that’s just plain ignorance.
One of these communities is the Land of OPSEC. The world of information security, simply put. An area of knowledge that should, without a doubt, be centered around the obvious fact of the matter. Easily. Want to be secured? Don’t use that—use this. Is this thing compromised? Update to this.
Right? Sort of. The world of digital security is probably one of the most politically mot…</span>

If you shine a flashlight through a tree blowing in the wind and vary the brightness to convey information, the signal can get distorted pretty easily.
However, if you have a constant brightness source and vary the color, it’s a lot easier to figure out what the source is trying to convey.</span>

What would be the benefit to updating legacy protocols to just use NL? You save a handful of bits at the expense of a lot of potential bugs. HTTP/1(.1) is mostly replaced by HTTP/2 and later by now anyway.
Sure, it makes sense not to require CRLF with any new protocols, but it doesn&#x27;t seem worth updating legacy things.

                              <span>Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;
The &#x27;chopsticks catch&#x27; was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.
The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn&#x27;t the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.
The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.
The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I&#x27;d guess there are even more &#x27;views&#x27; than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.
I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their &#x27;massive&#x27; Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in &#x27;full reuse&#x27; mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.
Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y&#x27;all did good.</span>

                              <span>First off, the booster was going about 1250 km/h when it started its landing burn, it relied purely on drag to get it slowed down to that speed.
Going by the telemetry of the seconds before the landing burn and noting the speed vs time, it seems drag was around 40 m/s^2 when it was going at around 3000 km/h. Since drag depends on velocity squared though, it had reduced to just above 10 m/s^2 just before the engines lit at 1250 km/h, and so would quickly become negligible once the engines lit.
Going by Wikipedia, the Super Heavy[1] has 3400000 kg of fuel at launch, so 3% of that is about 102000 kg. For the landing burn, it used 13 Raptor v3 engines[2] to scrub speed. Each Raptor flows about 650 kg/s max, so 3% fuel is enough for about 12 seconds for the 13 engines.
The empty mass of the Super Heavy is about 275000 kg, so about 377000 kg before the landing burn with 3% fuel.
Using the sea-level vs vacuum performance of the Raptor v2 engines, one can estimate that each Raptor v3 produces about 2.45 NM of force at sea-level. So 13 of them would produce about 31.85 MN of force.
Using Newton&#x27;s second law, F&#x3D;ma, this gives an initial deceleration of about 84 m/s^2 and about 104 m/s^2 when empty. If we do a rough spreadsheet integration, we get that a burn of roughly 4 seconds is needed to scrub the speed assuming no other forces.
Now, comparing this with reality, the full 13 engines were lit for a little over 5 seconds.
In my simplified calculations I was assuming full throttle the whole way, which obviously isn&#x27;t realistic, and I also assumed 3% fuel. So over all I think that&#x27;s a pretty decent estimation.

                              <span>MIMO and nonlinear control theories are probably some of the hardest topics in all of engineering. SpaceX control system also has to compensate for the fuel moving inside their rockets so the control algorithms probably involve some kind of fast numerical fluid simulation.
Another interesting thing SpaceX is doing is to use consumer-grade chips in triple redundancy configurations instead of using $100,000+ radiation-hardened aerospace/defense grade chips.</span>

                              <span>&gt; space shuttle was reusable
SpaceX builds vehicles. The Shuttle was “reusable” because they needed a term between the default for transportation capital expenditures (e.g. trains, planes, cars and ships) and the modified missiles that defined post-War spaceflight. “Reusable” in the Shuttle’s context meant  months of specialist overhaul time and the cost of a Falcon 9 launch in SRB booster replacements alone [0].
At the end of the day, in 2010, “the incremental cost per flight of the Space Shuttle was $409 million, or $14,186 per kilogram” [1]. ($591mm and $20,512 in 2024 dollars, respectively [2].) SpaceX’s prices per kg are around $3,170 on Falcon 9 [3] and $1,520 for Falcon Heavy [4]. Starship should bring those costs below $1000.

records on my walls as art
sometimes it feels like a battle to exist and be who you are.
These days, I feel criminally uncool. I open the Substack app, read a plethora of girlhood essays, and realize they no longer feel relatable.
After watching ​His Three Daughters (a brilliant movie), I thought about my dad and the dynamics within my own family as he was dying. We all grew up with a different dad and experienced a different relationship with him, which seems so bizarre. I also thought about his clothes. Did his wife throw them all out? What about his deathbed pajamas? Are they hanging up at the Goodwill? He&#x27;d probably be very disappointed in me for not having a job right now. He&#x27;d call me lazy.
started watching the new Marilyn Manson doc series. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m so surprised by what was revealed. Disappointed, disgusted, and pissed off to lose yet another musician/actor I like to the pits of shitty behavior.
I wish there were more indie-print literary magazines.
I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of Mina Le vids while eating dinner on my living room coffee table. (My kitchen table is overrun by my unfinished jigsaw puzzle atm)
Life has felt a little shaky lately. I feel like I&#x27;m on the precipice of so much change: moving in with my boyfriend (?), finding/starting a new job, and living out of the city (can I be a country girl?)

Ever heard the phrase: &quot;It works on my machine!&quot;? This phrase encapsulates a common frustration in modern application deployment, where developers often encounter inconsistencies between their local environments and those of their colleagues or production servers.

For instance, Dev A might run the application flawlessly on their PC, while Dev B struggles to replicate the same success, even with the exact same workflow and dependencies. These discrepancies, due to OS differences, software versions, or configurations, cause delays and increased troubleshooting.
Docker
Docker resolves this issue by offering a consistent environment via containers. By bundling the app and its dependencies, Docker ensures uniform execution across machines, eliminating the &quot;it works on my machine&quot; …</span>

1. ABBA - Lay All Your Love On Me


I genuinely don&#x27;t quite know if my enjoyment of ABBA is something I came by honestly, or something which is simply genetically engineered into my Scandinavian soul. I remember hearing my mom blasting their songs on the home stereo in my childhood, and the association has put permanent nostalgia blinders on me for all of ABBA&#x27;s greatest hits. Still, I think the beat is undeniable and the mournful tone of the chorus adds some real melancholy to th…</span>

                              <span>This is not a tense but a grammatical mood, it&#x27;s called the inferential mood. A bunch of languages have it to distinguish eyewitness accounts from reported speech.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_mood
Verb tense has to do with an action&#x27;s relationship to time, mood expresses the speaker&#x27;s relationship and attitude to the action. English is pretty low on moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive), while other languages have a more fun arsenal.</span>

If you&#x27;re stuck in a room and the only thing you can do is read a math textbook you are going to do it. If you are stuck in a room and you have a math textbook and a novel you now have a choice.
A phone? A phone is everything else. You&#x27;re putting &quot;the thing we are supposed to be doing&quot; and &quot;everything else&quot; in the same place. I can&#x27;t even do it as an adult, I need to put my phone on the other side of the room if I want to read something proper.</span>

                              <span>Reported this exact bug to Zendesk, Apple, and Slack in June 2024, both through HackerOne and by escalating directly to engs or PMs at each company.
I doubt we were the first. That is presumably the reason they failed to pay out.
The real issue is that non-directory SSO options like Sign in with Apple (SIWA) have been incorrectly implemented almost everywhere, including by Slack and other large companies we alerted in June.
Non-directory SSO should not have equal trust vs. directory SSO. If you have a Google account and use Google SSO, Google can attest that you control that account. Same with Okta and Okta SSO.
SIWA, GitHub Auth, etc are not doing this. They rely on a weaker proof, usually just control of email at a single point in time.
SSO providers are not fungible, even if the email address is the same. You need to take this into account when designing your trust model. Most services do not.</span>

Incredible. This must be some kind of &quot;damaged ego&quot; or ass-covering, as it&#x27;s clearly not a rational decision.

                              <span>It sounds like the author got stiffed by Zendesk on this bug, $0 due to email spoofing being out of scope.
The $50k was from other bug bounties he was awarded on hackerone.
It&#x27;s too bad Zendesk basically said &quot;thanks&quot; but then refused to pay anything. That&#x27;s a good way to get people not to bother with your big bounty program. It is often better to build goodwill than to be a stickler for rules and technicalities.
Side note: I&#x27;m not too surprised, as I had one of the worst experiences ever interviewing with Zendesk a few years back. I have never come away from an interview hating a company, except for Zendesk.</span>

                              <span>I think a lot of people are talking past each other. I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.
For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.
I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.
There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.
This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.</span>

                              <span>People really like to talk about writing, don&#x27;t they? I don&#x27;t personally mind it, in fact I like writing too, but it feels like every other post that is on the trending tab is about either blogging or writing or Bearblog.
It&#x27;s quite barebones, and I wish it would be simpler to talk to bloggers. Not many blogs have a comments section, and if I want to talk about their post, I may have to email them or go onto a different social media platform to do so. I know I don&#x27;t have a dedicated comments section or guestbook, and perhaps that makes me a hypocrite, but I do wish other blogs had one. I&#x27;ll likely set a guestbook up, now that I think about it.
Rubidium hasn&#x27;t been mentioned on Bearblog once in its history, which is slightly alarming.
Blogging is well and truly alive, which I love because it&#x27;s far more interesting than the tacky Twitter vignettes or heavily processed Instagram posts.
It was pointless trying to promote my main blog over social channels...everyone here is getting by without doing so, and seems quite content with it. Fame isn&#x27;t an issue, and I like that.

On the Bear Blog you are free to write whatever the fuck you want. You can write poetry, write your to-do lists, plan your D&amp;D campaign, anything. Anything you want, including bizarre shit your mind is telling you. It is anonymous if you want to. If you already have a blog tied to your real identity, create another one, just for incoherent rumblings about something that bothers you. Indescribable shit. It can be a sentence long. Even one word. Be yourself. Be a schizo. Be a prophet.</span>

                              <span>Before this blog, I&#x27;d pondered the idea of starting a Patreon or a newsletter of some sort. I liked the idea of doing a semi-regular thought or artdump, and the idea of people wanting to tune into said dumps. But I always hesitated for two reasons.
One was that I didn&#x27;t do anything on a schedule, and if I did do something regularly, I&#x27;d stop as soon as it became a task on my to-do list.1 And two was that I&#x27;ve developed a habit of wanting to escape my audience if I knew it was there – worse if I knew who was in it. The awareness made it difficult for me to write or draw or post freely, always thinking about how it would look and if it was good enough and if the people I knew were watching would be offended.
RSS comes as a relief for the overly self-conscious me. While not knowing who is rea…</span>

                              <span>i haven&#x27;t been able to make much art lately. which is pretty frustrating, because i genuinely want to work on art. but i have been nonstop stressed for the past month. and unfortunately, being stressed out makes my health problems flare up, which means that my ability to concentrate goes completely out the window.
every now and then, i&#x27;ll pull out my sketchbook to doodle something, or sketching stuff in MS Paint, or whatever. i&#x27;m trying to keep my creative skills engaged, even if it&#x27;s in small amounts. but man... it&#x27;s rough. i keep fantasizing about drawing beautiful illustrations, and not having the physical strength to do anything about it.
i&#x27;m accustomed to this cycle, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less miserable, you know? i can&#x27;t even begin to count how many times i&#x27;ve been through this. my best coping method for this dreaded cycle is to avoid beating myself up over it, try to be patient and forgiving with myself, and chip away at projects when i&#x27;m able to.
it feels kind of embarrassing to keep reposting art from my archives, though. i&#x27;ve been posting art to mastodon/bluesky, since i&#x27;m trying to rebuild my online presence in a post-cohost world. and... i desperately wish i had newer pieces to show. it&#x27;ll happen when it happens - i shouldn&#x27;t risk pushing my body further when i&#x27;m already in a lot of pain - but i still feel sad about it.
just gotta take a deep breath, and be patient. in the meantime, i&#x27;d like to take the downtime to study art styles i find compelling. i&#x27;ve gravitated towards 90s anime fantasy art for years, despite my shockingly-minimal exposure to anime, so it&#x27;d be fun to study some artbooks. and maybe i&#x27;ll take the time to work on more weird little web projects - we&#x27;ll see.</span>

Title: COVID-19 UK Mutual Aid groups: a list
Date: 13/03/2020
Source: https://freedomnews.org.uk/2020/03/13/covid-19-uk-mutual-aid-groups-a-list/

As the global COVID-19 pandemic is upon us, a number of mutual aid groups have started forming across the country. The groups aim at providing community support to those who are more at risk from the virus: be it help with running errands or cooking.
COVID-19 is a novel virus most affecting people’s respiratory systems. While in around 8o% cases the symptoms will be mild, it can lead to death. It is estimated that 2-3 people out of a hundred will die. This can easily mean hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone.

Title: It’s spelt Sisterhood, not Cis-terhood
Date: 22/05/2018

 The signatories of this letter strongly condemn the actions and doctrines of the Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs)*. This strain of feminism recently gained notoriety due to their problematic opposition of the proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (these reforms proposes to allow trans and non- binary people to self- declare their gender without, as is the case now, going through humiliating legal and medical process). This law could help to make the lives of a highly discriminated against minority easier. TERFs however claim that the aim of the proposed law change is a threat to cis women.…</span>

Lembra como foi o processo? Alguém finalmente te convencia, aí então você ia lá &quot;beleza então me fala aí onde me cadastro?&quot; e você ouvia que tinha que &quot;escolher uma instância&quot;.
