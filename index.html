                              <span>I’ll keep this one short and sweet.
Tesla was contacted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday after videos posted on social media showed the company’s robotaxis driving in a chaotic manner on public roads in Austin, Texas.
Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker debuted autonomous trips in Austin on Sunday, opening the service to a limited number of riders by invitation only.
In the videos shared widely online, one Tesla robotaxi was spotted traveling the wrong way down a road, and another was shown braking hard in the middle of traffic, responding to “stationary police vehicles outside its driving path,” among several other examples.

Elon Musk is not that smart. He chose to use cameras only, and not Lidar, against the advice of his own engineers.
China has robotaxis already. They work fine. They have Lidar.
Tesla is doomed. Their cars are worse than those of their competitors and more expensive. Robotaxis aren’t going to work. The only thing saving Tesla right now is 100% tariffs on Chinese autos, but even non Chinese electric cars are better and often cheaper.
Meanwhile Musk is in a feud with Trump, Trump has threatened to remove subsidies for Musk enterprises and Musk (again, an idiot) has said Trump should go ahead. And yes, he does need those subsidies.
The majority of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla, and it’s days are numbered. Meanwhile Starship keeps exploding, the last time during fueling, not even after launch. There are a lot of competitors to SpaceX, and w/o NASA contracts SpaceX doesn’t look so hot either. Right now NASA is stuck with Musk, but that’s not going to last.
Musk isn’t going to be the world’s richest man much longer.

Before Gobekli Tepe became an internet sensation by psuedo-archeologist Graham Hancock, I visited the site in 2008. That was 17 years ago. It was not a tourist site at the time. It was a working archeological dig. I was greeted by the foreman and I asked if I could take photos. He said yes, and I did. Some of you might recall them. Here is what it looked like then and here is a link to the photos:

                              <span>Just a quick word that my friend and ex-boss Sean-Paul Kelley is posting fairly often now. Sean-Paul founded the (now defunct) Agonist blog back in the day, which was very important during the Iraq War. He also gave me my first salaried job as the managing editor of the Agonist. (I received some money for writing at BOPNews, but only some.)
I’m pleased to have him here. Do take the time to read the author byline above posts so you know if it’s him or me. Because almost all writing here has been mine, historically, people often assume all posts are from me. Sean-Paul’s more of an old school blogger than I am. Remember that guest posters publish in part to give different takes than I would and I don’t pre-approve their posts, unless they’re very infrequent or new.
(Those who remember Mandos will get this. Out of a hundred Mandos posts I might have agreed with one.) That said, Sean-Paul and I agree about most things.</span>

                              <span>As a Canadian, the issue of people removing snow from the sidewalk is a big deal. Some years ago I lived near a house where they never removed the snow. It piled up till it was almost four feet high, and some partial thaws meant that underneath all that snow was ice. Every time I had to walk in that direction I cursed the owners (there was an SUV that came and went, so I knew it wasn’t uninhabited.) And one time I did slip and I was furious, even though the pain of the fall was minor.
Thing is, I don’t enjoy being furious or upset. Oh, a little anger is sometimes nice enough, but overall it’s an unpleasant feeling unless you’ve been having even worse emotions like fear, despair, powerlessness or self-pity.

This is a great development. But it ignores, like the Democratic party in general, a larger reality: blue collar men. White collar men are indoctrinated in high school and college now how to behave around women. But blue collar men are not. And there are more of them than white collar Ivy Leaguers.

                              <span>The Russo-Ukrainian War of 2021-present has entered a new phase. In the wake of the Ukraine’s hybrid/asymmetric attack on Russia’s strategic bomber fleet–aka Operation Spiderweb–Russia is getting its revenge in the smartest way possible. Russia has begun a massive month long air/missile/drone campaign that is systematically attacking command and control centers all over the country. The latest was a Russian X-22 missile attack on a former drilling rig disguuised as a seaborne command and control center. A Tu-22M3 Backfire bomber launched the X-22 cruise missile where it reached Mach 4 and then dove into the command center and obliterated it. There are dozens of videos out now on reputable sites indicating this campaign is ongoing and will continue.
This is very, very bad news for the Ukraine. This might not be the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the middle.
The site for reasonably unbiased updates is Military TV. But, viewer beware, this is uncensored warfare.</span>

The best analysis I’ve read of this is definitely from Matt Stoller. He defines this win as a “system defining election”, that is an attempt to not just to change who runs a system, but how that system is run. Read the article.
I’ll point out here that there have been a few such attempts. Matt talks about Lamont’s challenge to Lieberman, where Lamont won the primary, then Lieberman won the election. That is what will be tried here: the oligarchical part of the party will align behind another candidate, possibly even the Republican one. Those who don’t will try to co-opt Mamdani and turn him into a centri…</span>
