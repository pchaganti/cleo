                              <span>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that there was a decent size, but small market for SBCs for low-volume embedded work (including hobbyists) before Raspberry Pi. You could get a lot of different kinds of boards with good Linux support and a not terrible price. Often, a processor vendor would explicitly provide support for these things because it was a good vector for selling chips.
Broadcom, having never wanted anything to do with this market since volumes were too low, had an abundance of a CPU SKU that was good for this. So some broadcom engineers founded Raspberry Pi to use up this excess stock, essentially getting these chips for free. The original RPi blew every other SBC out of the water on price performance (and many manufacturers out of the market) because by getting the most expensive component for free, they could sell Pis for an extremely low price. It also massively expanded the market for SBCs, as hobbyists flooded in to work with RPis.
5-10 years ago, the sweetheart deal with Broadcom went away. Now Raspberry Pi has to compete with everyone else for Broadcom SoCs, and during the semiconductor shortage of 2020, Broadcom had tremendous leverage. Now, Raspberry Pi pricing is nothing special, but they still have the brand name and they have captured the community (on the back of behavior that was borderline anticompetitive).</span>

                              <span>That&#x27;s because RaspberryPis are no longer cheap throw away computers meant for education or hobbyists, they&#x27;re developer kits for manufacturers that need a CPU running a well supported mainline Linux in their products.
The only reason they don&#x27;t cost $500 or more is because the foundation needs the hobbyist market to write and support the open source BSP, without which the RPi would be just another poorly supported also-ran in an already crowded market. With how well supported mainline Linux is on the Pi, EEs would be willing to pay a lot more.</span>

                              <span>I self-host a (non-critical) mail server and a few other things and occasionally look at live firewall logs, seeing the constant flow of illegitimate traffic hitting random ports all over the place, some hitting legitimate service ports but others just probing basically anything and everything. I decided to setup a series of scripts that detect activity on ports that aren&#x27;t open (and therefore there&#x27;s no legitimate reason for the traffic to exist) and block those IP addresses from the service ports since the traffic source isn&#x27;t to be trusted.
Something that came out of analysis of the blocked IP addresses was that I discovered a few untrustworthy /24 networks belonging to a bunch of &quot;internet security companies&quot; whose core business seems to depend on flooding the entire IPv4 space with daily scans. Blocking these Internet scanner networks significantly reduced the uninvited activity on my open service ports. And by significantly I mean easily over 50% of unwanted traffic is blocked.
Network lists and various scripts to achieve my setup can be found here:

Internet Scanner lists are here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
Large networks that seem responsible for more than their fair share of uninvited activity are listed here:
https://github.com/UninvitedActivity/UninvitedActivity/tree/...
I&#x27;m semi-aware of the futility of blocking IP addresses and networks. I do believe, however, that it can significantly reduce the load on the next layers of security that require computation for pattern matching etc.
Be aware: there are footguns to be found here.</span>

                              <span>I have always loved reading, even as a child. I remember reading under the covers until 2am, way past lights out and my bedtime. I would go to the library after school and put my name down on the waiting list for newly released books. I&#x27;d (im)patiently wait for my turn.
But for some reason, I never appreciated the books we were assigned to read in school. I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s due to the selection of books, or just the fact that I was required to read it (I’m not great at being told what to do). Either way, I would read the books I wanted, and read cliff notes (are cliff notes still a thing today?) of those that I didn&#x27;t read for school.
Needless to say, I completely regret showing a lack of appreciation for the classic books. To make up for it, I am attempting to build up a collection of books I admire that I should&#x27;ve appreciated a long time ago. The goal is to get the covers I remember from back in the day, instead of the more modernized version.
Yesterday’s thrift finds:
Bridge to Terabithia
A Wrinkle in Time
The Great Gatsby
The Metamorphoses
It joins my (still small) existing collection of:
Lord of the Flies
To Kill a Mockingbird
A Tale of Two Cities
Fahrenheit 451
Gulliver&#x27;s Travels
One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest
Now I just need to find the time to re-read them all. Do you have a favorite classic must-read?
Bonus find: An original Sound of Music vinyl record -- this was a super happy find. I initially found a really scratched one, but thankfully found a total of THREE at the thrift store. I was able to pick the one that didn&#x27;t have a lot of scratches on it. Super excited to play it on the record player.

                              <span>I have been preparing for job interviews (looking to get into genai+backend roles you know). I like building projects and learning new stuff but job search is something that scares me. Partly because of the various uncertainties involved like places to apply, strenous interview processes, where I would work next, what kind of work I will get. It’s not the first time I am going through this process but it sucks (a lot in the beginning atleast). The other aspect is the grind.
Translation: I am not afraid of slap sir, I am afraid of job search
I could be solving some leetcode problems right now, I could be applying right now… I have many things to do even outside job search - oh no - fuck fuck fuck. That’s sort of the state of my mind - atleast in the background. Till I don’t build some momen…</span>

                              <span>In the last decade Tech has become part of the establishment. They are one of the dominant controlling forces.
The blackout was _not_ about preserving free speech, or any other moral high road.  It was purely about control. Tech hadn’t yet cemented their position as a dominant player and didn’t want to cede the control they had.
Now that they’ve embedded themselves in the ruling class they don’t care as much because they already have control.</span>

                              <span>There are two different questions at play here, and we need to be careful what we wish for.
The first concern is the most legitimate one: can I stop an LLM from training itself on my data? This should be possible and Perplexity should absolutely make it easy to block them from training.
The second concern, though, is can Perplexity do a live web query to my website and present data from my website in a format that the user asks for? Arguing that we should ban this moves into very dangerous territory.
Everything from ad blockers to reader mode to screen readers do exactly the same thing that Perplexity is doing here, with the only difference being that they tend to be exclusively local. The very nature of a &quot;user agent&quot; is to be an automated tool that manipulates content hosted on the internet according to the specifications given to the tool by the user. I have a hard time seeing an argument against Perplexity using this data in this way that wouldn&#x27;t apply equally to countless tools that we already all use and which companies try with varying degrees of success to block.
I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where website owners can use DRM to force me to display their website in exactly the way that their designers envisioned it. I want to be able to write scripts to manipulate the page and present it in a way that&#x27;s useful for me. I don&#x27;t currently use llms this way, but I&#x27;m uncomfortable with arguing that it&#x27;s unethical for them to do that so long as they&#x27;re citing the source.</span>

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Stone at a public NASA event many years ago.  I asked him, perhaps a silly question: &quot;what does it feel like to know you built the furthest man-made known object in the universe?&quot;.
He paused for a moment, after which he responded, with a smile: &quot;Pretty darn good&quot;.
RIP, Dr. Stone and go Voyager go!

There are many excellent blogging platforms available nowadays. The concept of &quot;better&quot; is not especially relevant. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences and requirements.
This post outlines why I chose Bear after trying many different tools. If your blogging preferences align with mine, then Bear might be the right platform for you too. If you&#x27;re already happy with your current tool, congratulations – no need to keep reading.
Simplicity
At the last minute, I decided to leave this part out. Not that Bear isn&#x27;t easy to use, it&#x27;s very straightforward, but so are most other &quot;indie platforms&quot;. You&#x27;ll be up and running in no time, no matter what you pick.

                              <span>Jonathan Cott has written about the meaning of those stories and rhymes we consider to be for children. He has also written about the childlike nature of certain rock and pop songs, especially certain songs by The Beatles and Donovan. He has interviewed artists, musicians, writers and others from Chinua Achebe to John Lennon and many more. His works refer to everyone from Carl Jung to Tony Bennett; Rollo May to the Old Testament; Greg Bateson to Gaston Bachelard. At times, his ability to connect seemingly disparate phenomena is mind-blowing. Other time, one nods their head knowingly at a reference that they might have often considered just to see it verified via Cott’s quotation and argument tying the two things together. Some might consider his considerations too fanciful while others might see them as so simply obvious they wonder why he bothered to even write them down.

Title: What makes you think you can govern me?
Date: Summer 2024.
Source: Retrieved on Jun 14 2024 from https://unfuturingzine.com/unfuturing-01-summer24.pdf.

 What makes you think you can govern me? 
 When my mind is about to explode and fling 
 Shrapnel in every direction and into the void 
 For this soul of mine is weeping, while yours gently 
 Blow sleeping in the gaze of protective eyes. 
 Barrage the barricades of your world ‘til they tumble 
 Crumble onto the doorstep of our anarchist utopia? 
 A ticking fission or fusion bomb around the nuclear family - 
 I cannot wait until it disintegrates into ash 
 It never did anything to me - Blood 
 Lines only weave together pain - Choose 
 Your own kind over the abstract confines 
 Of a triple helix with the extra back 
 Bone of suffering. 
 The bigotry ebbs and flows through our collective 
 Memories that we perhaps should forget but cannot 
 Unsee through flashbacks of those who harmed - 
 Us, through bricks at glass and break the institution 
 That hates us - that seeks to eradicate us 
 Yas I may be extreme but was that ever a bad thing - 
 I’ll just shine with the light of a trillion photons 
 Exploding and releasing the energy 
 Of my ungovernable queer self.</span>

 Dear Society, 
 Telling me the way to go - never fit myself into your gender 
 Confines and even in my disruption their compulsion to fit 
 Me into a box flickers behind… shadows. The flames 
 Burning my mind, or am I burning. Fuck. Their stereotypes. 
 You cannot speak up about anything. Be passionate. 
 Rant about ableism and transphobia and they give strange looks 
 And yeah girls can do that, but I’m not one of them… 
 And my identity of being loud… is this just internalized misogyny…? 
 Head and a broken body, too wrong, but I feel no connection to the physical 
 Right…? 
 I guess that’s a lie. Cannot be stoic. Only a fragment. 
 If …</span>

                              <span>I do not think it is cynical to assume that Microsoft would sell this to companies as a way to do constant surveillance of their employees with OCR and LLMs used to make it easier for a manager to sift through massive amounts of data.
That&#x27;s just an actual use case that their true customers would pay for, I think it&#x27;s awful and should be illegal under any reasonable worker protections but why would they not advertise it this way privately to business customers?
I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cynical to think that a manager looking for a reason to get rid of someone will have a much easier time justifying a PIP or just straight up firing someone if they can retroactively have an AI do it for them.
Why wouldn&#x27;t they be able to ask the system &quot;how much of &#x27;s time do they spend doing things on the computer that are not directly related to ?&quot;
Is it technically happening already? Sure, there&#x27;s nasty nasty spyware being forced on people and it is awful and I hate that those employers are getting away with it. But integrated into the OS, on by default, with a long memory? Just imagine how easy it will be to fire anyone that tries to unionize in an effort to fight against such surveillance.</span>

                              <span>My takeaway is that Microsoft has been trying to boil the frog, but slipped and turned the temperature up too quickly. They&#x27;re retreating for now, but make no mistake that Recall will slowly trickle back into Windows under another name. Every major power broker wants something like Recall to become the norm - bosses to spy on their employees, governments to spy on their citizens/enemies, and tech CEO&#x27;s to collect training data for AI and target more ads at end users.</span>

                              <span>This is confusing and vague to me, which I believe is exactly the intent. It focuses on security, reiterates that security is their top priority (and we know that this is untrue). What were the security problems? They don&#x27;t even allude to the existence or detection of any specific security problems.
It sounds to me like they&#x27;re figuring out a new marketing approach, or they&#x27;re softening the blow by &quot;listening to users&quot; and then rolling out more slowly, when outrage has died down and people will just accept it.</span>

                              <span>If anyone is curious, in 2009, I discovered that Jim Storer was the author of the first Lunar Lander game and interviewed him about it (and also chronicled the history of the game beyond that). He later provided the source code, which was awesome.
https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html
My favorite part is this:
“After leaving high school I never thought about the game again,” says Storer. “Until about a couple of months ago when someone e-mailed me about this, I was completely unaware of any Lunar Lander game other than the one I wrote in high school.”</span>

                              <span>This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since March 2024. As usual, we wish to remind our readers that the DSGE model forecast is not an official New York Fed forecast, but only an input to the Research staff’s overall forecasting process. For more information about the model and variables discussed here, see our DSGE model Q &amp; A.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been journalling for a long time now. It&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t even think about anymore; just a thing I do. Some people meditate, others pray. I write.
I&#x27;ve published a few essays about how journaling has impacted my life by providing the space for me to reflect on my day. One thing I have never done until this year, however, is read any of my old journals.
This may seem strange, since what is the point of writing if not to be read. But that isn&#x27;t why I do it. I write as a practice. As a thing that I do. If all my journals were lost in a house fire, I&#x27;d be sad, yes. But the documentation of my life isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s valuable. That value has already been gleaned through the act itself.
That being said, I tried reading one of my old journals at the beginning of this year and it turns out I can…</span>

hacks? Don&#x27;t tell me you are already watching videos on how to do xyz thing fast instead of focusing on basics.
First step of optimization should be to profile if you are milking the basics enough or not.
Leveling up in anything boils down to a few simple processes. I repeat simple but hard to execute - doing minimum viable research to get started, understanding the basics, doing the thing and focusing.
Minimum viable research - finding the correct resources, enough to get started with, finding a mentor or a teacher. The emphasis is to get enough to get started. This is pretty easy especially for knowledge work given we have internet and chatgpt. The basics are more or less similar across most resources plus as you progress…</span>

Nothing about the three hostages who were also apparently killed in the Israeli attack, including an American citizen.  More

                              <span>President Biden once pledged to adopt more humane immigration policies than his predecessor.  But in practice, as immigrant rights advocates have documented, his administration has escalated the attack on the legal right of people facing life-threatening conditions to seek safety. Even though this right is guaranteed regardless of how asylum seekers enter the country, he has sought to restrict access to ports of entry. More

                              <span>Neoliberalism seems impermeable to the facts. The theory is that markets are efficient, and privatization, deregulation, and liberalization will bring about the best of all possible worlds, so if the facts don’t fit the theory, so much the worse for the facts. The image that has haunted me is one from the movie The Matrix, where human beings are plugged into a system that has them dreaming of a pleasant alternate reality while their bodies are being sucked dry of the nutrients and energy to feed alien beings.

                              <span>it&#x27;s easy to get distracted by the current discourse on what people are learning (or posing to learn).
you need to be careful on prioritising what you want to learn.
somehow these days the meme has been let&#x27;s do hardware, c is cracked, we will go cuda. it&#x27;s downstream of what influential figures like karpathy are pursuing.
problem is, mere exposure can make you feel more interested in new things like gpu programming, writing llm in c and unconsciously prioritise the same when let&#x27;s say you were already trying to learn about the transformer architecture. (shiny object syndrome sort of situation lol)
frequently hopping bandwagons will lead to scattered attention and you don&#x27;t want that. now i get it, you gotta pursue your intellectual curiosity but you also need to think from your usecase point of view.
what do i require to learn more urgently? what will allow me to build the thing i want to build faster? what is more relevant for me based on my previous understanding? is it worth going this deep in the stack for now?
depending on the time you have, you can pursue more than 2 things in parallel but you gotta stick to what you have decided atleast for a few days.</span>

                              <span>The most helpful perspective of looking at money is stored time. You can exchange money for time or time for money. It&#x27;s like a balance. To make money you need to invest time. And you get back time by spending money. That can be time saved by hiring someone to do something for you. Even when buying a nice painting you are buying the stored time of a painter(not to mention the talent).
This perspective is helpful as it gives a clear motivation. You would want to leverage your time to make a lot of money. This can be working efficiently at things where you exchange your time for money like a job or freelance work. But such things only scale linearly. True leverage is owning a piece of something. Something valuable. Something exponential. This can be taking the time to build products that people want, invest or have equity.
On the other side of the equation, you want to make sure you are not doing anything stupid with your time. Let&#x27;s say you spend 1 hour cooking to save money. Is the value of the saved money less or more than the value of 1 hour of your time? Have you ever thought about it? Cooking for fun or just as a hangout with friends or lack of healthier alternatives is a different value proposition. One that you might be more than happy to make.
Thinking of your time and money as an interchangeable value store gives a framework that you can leverage in your favour.</span>

                              <span>&gt;Salons and groups have always existed but why the recent shift to private discourse?
Because the public internet makes it too easy for people to sell you stuff, extract value from you, or harass you. Private chats are human-scale environments where understandable social norms---not commerce, algorithms, or formal rules---drive the interactions. It&#x27;s an authentic experience.</span>

That event really drove home for me the fact that all of the trainings, emails, processes, etc. are mostly plausible deniability. There are people who care about security at MS. I know, I&#x27;ve met them, but for the most part all of this exists so that Satya can plausibly say in court or in front of congress, &quot;well we told them to do security better.

Satya&#x27;s model of making security a priority at Microsoft:
- Cram ads in every nook and corner of Windows. Left, right, centre, back, front, everywhere. What else is an operating system for?
- Install a recorder which records everything you do. For the benefit of users of course - you know, what if a user missed an ad and wants to go back and see what they missed.
- Send a mail to your employees and tell them &quot;Do security&quot;. Mission accomplished - Microsoft is now the most secure platform.</span>

Anyone who&#x27;s previously worked with 3D printing knows that this simply does not pass any kind of a sniff test. Both preventing and detecting internal defects is one of the, if not the hardest problem in 3D printing. There are many large companies trying to find ways to reliably solve just this problem alone.

                              <span>The Ricoh GRIIIx I reserved at the beginning of May finally came in earlier this month. The camera has a bit of a learning curve that I&#x27;m still getting used to, but am really enjoying the portability of it. Although I&#x27;m used to shooting with a 35mm, I&#x27;m still finding myself having to work around a 40mm. I think at the end of the day, this is still better for me than a 28mm (that the GRIII has) since I prefer tighter frames.


Marty&#x27;s Grill has pretty decent Cheesesteak, although obviously not comparable to an authentic Philly Cheesesteak. LSC also seems to like their burgers.

I&#x27;m constantly surprised, and, by this point in my life, I shouldn&#x27;t be, but I am. What of? People who feel the need to constantly be busy or doing this, and that, and, well, the other. Is it something that happened slowly, over night, I wonder? Is it since the advent of smart phones, or maybe TV even? Or was it always there and I just didn&#x27;t notice it?
Because, I&#x27;m of a mind that I really don&#x27;t feel the need to be constantly doing something, anything, or going somewhere to do something (like sports), whether to participate or watch. I&#x27;m not always in front of a screen, or TV. I have a life outside of smart gadgets that involves me walking around a garden, or sitting in a park staring at, well,…</span>

                              <span>I spent about a year struggling with GJK back in the 1990s.
It&#x27;s useful for collision detection in 3D, and it can also be used as a closest-points algorithm. As a closest-points algorithm, it&#x27;s easy to understand the basics. You have two convex solids. Start with a random point on each, and get the distance between those points. On each solid, try to improve the distance by advancing along each edge from the current point. Pick the new closest point. Repeat.
This stops working when the closest point is no longer a vertex. That&#x27;s when the &quot;simplex&quot; concept is needed. The closest points can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-edge, edge-face (no unique solution) and face-face (no unique solution). The simplex thing is really doing a case analysis of those cases.
Lots of things go wrong in practice. If you are doing a physics engine, objects will often settle into face-face contact. A single-point collision model will then result in vibration or incorrect movement. Also, as positions settle into face-face contact, the GJK algorithm runs into a small difference of large values problem that can result in a complete loss of floating point significance. 
The termination condition can also cause infinite looping.
In theory, this is an elegant solution, but it&#x27;s a difficult numerical analysis problem.
Despite that, it&#x27;s probably the fastest approach to the problem. It&#x27;s O(log N) in normal cases, and O(1) for situations where the positions are closest to the previous positions and you use the last solution as the starting point.
The late Prof. Steven Cameron at Oxford did a lot of work on getting GJK right.
I used GJK in &quot;Falling Bodies&quot;, the first commercial 3D ragdoll system, in the late 1990s.</span>

Our entire society deifies charismatic phonies. They are the ones that get elevated to the highest positions in politics and the C-level business suite. They&#x27;re always the heroic Main Character. They build up cult followings. They often look so good, speak so smoothly and have those irresistible Ivy League mannerisms. You&#x27;re supposed to like them and help elevate them even higher.
Do you want to expose this person? The Main Character? You better be right, and you better be ready to have the full force of his charm, persuasion, and cult following at your throat forever.</span>

                              <span>&gt; If a founder cashes out 10% of their position for $500k @ $25M Series A valuation, that de-risks a lot of their personal life. But when the startup ends up selling for $250M, that $500k of &#x27;early&#x27; selling would have been worth $5M (less any dilution between rounds) - hard not to regret the choice in that case even if hedging is going to be the correct choice 99% of the time.
IMHO, it&#x27;s very easy not to regret, with those particular numbers.
I&#x27;d take $500K now plus possibly $45M later -- over $0 now and possibly $50M later.
I&#x27;d take that deal even if &quot;possibly&quot; were &quot;guaranteed&quot;.
(Who might regret that is a founder who was otherwise already wealthy.)</span>

                              <span>I recently left a long career in FANG to roll the dice on an early startup.  I was pretty surprised by the uneven terms between founders and early employees.  From what I could tell the early employees takes more risk than the founders because they don&#x27;t get that magic token dollar turning into their share of the founding equity event and have to pay the fictional valuation of the seed to convert their options. Depending on how hot your startup is that can be a lot of money.
Anyway that ended in tears, but I got what I was looking for from it. A look under the covers of the hot VC backed startup roller coaster.  I may be getting old and cynical, but it looked considerably more exploitative than what I saw at Google.  Obviously depends on the character of the founders and leaders, but the structure seems to be setup for toxicity.</span>

                              <span>I was mentally, physically and emotionally worn out when I left my previous startup after being an early employee. Despite that I really wanted to stay and be part of what my friends and I were building. Had I had the chance to &#x27;de-risk my life&#x27; with some equity to replenish my empty bank account, which was empty from taking an early employee salary, I may have been able to stay but in the end I had to get out.
Getting out for an early employee after funding rounds is expensive because buying options can hit you with massive tax bills on top of the cost of buying the options. Worse, the stats aren&#x27;t great for a chance on return. Your lotto ticket gets expensive and risky as soon as you decide to leave.
Articles like this one hammer home more and more to me how little VCs actually value early employees. Paying out founders to stay is a strategic move. Keeping them is worth it because they are the face of the company and turmoil at that level hurts their payout. Burning out early employees is not a concern because you can just swap them without drama. In fact, with the way options are structured and the &#x27;industry wisdom&#x27; to hold off purchasing, it feels like a strategic move to burn out early employees since many employees that are forced out often can&#x27;t even buy their options. They are left with nothing after all that work and risk. From a purely cynical view this is a great thing for VCs since now the company got all the benefit of an early employee and just lost all the costs.
I don&#x27;t know about the other three points, but I can guarantee you point 1 of &#x27;right sizing perceptions&#x27; is wrong.</span>

                              <span>Secondary at Series A is very rare. Part of the reason more early employees don&#x27;t get included in secondary sales is because of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 14e-2. If you have more than 10 sellers involved, the transaction can be considered a tender offer, which triggers additional regulatory requirements and disclosures.
&gt; As of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking.
Please let us all know how that&#x27;s working out for you in 5-10 years. 4 months in and no stress? Must be easy riding from here!</span>

                              <span>The best startups have a concept which is summed up thusly:
“We all go to the pay window at the same time.”
It’s ok for founders to take a little bit of money off of the table if they extend that to their employees as well. Asymmetry is where things get weird.
I’ve seen many founders who got deep into the fundraising cycles without ever realizing they could take a cent out. VCs will constantly tell you to let it all ride, and sometimes that works out, but for most people, having a little bit of financial security while you’re trying to change the world is necessary.
The best startups figure out how to manage liquidity through financing in a way that aligns incentives, keeps the goalposts at the mission, while allowing their teams to thrive.
It’s about alignment. If everyone is pulling in the same direction you’re going to execute the vision. Whether you win in the startup lottery is up to the threads of fate, but alignment is the straightest path towards a result.</span>

 “Solidarity is a constant attack against the system and society, an act where the words fabrication, innocent, guilty, do not fit. Because as revolutionaries it is our duty to always be guilty for this system, always dangerous and always proud of our choices. We are not persecuted for our ideas, but because it seemed poor to us to not transubstantiate them into actions.” 
 (Gerasimos Tsakalos member of the prisoners cell of C.C.F.).

Communique on the arson against the French press agency (Athens, 3/12/2008)
 While the peaceful citizens where enjoying the coffee break of their inexistance in the paved street of Kolonaki, we set ourselves for once again under the “services” of destruction and prepared a new gift out of idyllic ashes. With these, we send our revolutionary greetings to the French comrades that selected to attack the network of the high speed trains, sabotaging the routes of everyday hurry and anxiety, of a determined pre-set life imposed by the bio-authority to its subjects.

 Welcome to Post-anarchism Today. This is certainly not USA Today, et ce n’est certainement pas Aujourd’hui en France. Indeed, it is a refreshing antidote to all such discourses of modern state capitalism. During its short but colourful existence, post-anarchism has always been libertarian and socialist in its basic philosophical outlook: that’s the anarchism part. But post-@ has also maintained its independence from modern rationalism and modern concepts of subjectivity: that’s the post- part. As I survey post-anarchism today, I find to my surprise and delight that both parts are stronger than ever. It’s now clear t…</span>

                              <span>I used to LOVE collecting stickers, and in some ways, I still do. Every time I traveled or visited some place, if they had stickers, I would get at least one. They were my souvenirs from all the places I visited, each sticker told some kind of story or memory.
Over the years, I started facing a dilemma that I never truly faced when I was collecting other things like magnets or keychains: where do I put them? The idea of permanence gave me some unneeded anxiety. On one hand, I loved the idea of decorating my laptop with the stickers, but the thought of losing those stickers when my laptop died (because they all inevitable do), made me super sad. This hesitation led to a growing collection of stickers sitting unused, each waiting for that perfect place that never seemed to come.

That’s how it feels reading my RSS feed these days.
Perhaps the biggest mistake I made was adding some aggregator feeds, one that features posts from various uncurated blogs. Which is weird because it didn’t feel that way before, but now.. I’m not quite sure what happened.
When I get lucky, I get to read and discover some nice things happening to a stranger, or perhaps read about their current struggles and dilemma. When I’m not so lucky (which is half the time), I get to read how AI is the next big inevitable shining future, and make a million dollars in a few months with a written ad every three paragraphs.
I guess it’s time to clean up my morning newspaper and manually curate it if I want to read quality human posts from now on. I feel sad for all the new, worthy blogs I won’t get to randomly discover because of this change, but I know I will eventually find my way to it if I’m meant to encounter it.
Life has always been that way, and I know it always will.</span>
