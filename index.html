                              <span>I have a PhD in Physics from Berkeley. Still, in the strictest real estate sense, my best and highest use is as a dishwasher.
I was managing a small optics factory in Livermore. We made laser mirrors to order there — any wavelength, any reflectivity, any angle, any polarization, you name it. I was working my ass off and was unmarried at the time. Thanksgiving came around and I had nowhere to go. But I hooked up with a church in San Jose that had a dinner for poor people and went as a volunteer. After serving the dinner, I wandered back into the dish room. I immediately went over to the sink and kicked out the lady who was pretending to work. I then washed all the dishes and left.
Comes one year later.  I’m in the exact same situation.  I call up that church.  The lady says, “Oh, that’s very nice of you.  But we don’t need any more volunteers, we have enough.”  Oh shit.  What to do.  I found my old replica army parka I had bought in a Cambridge surplus store 20 years earlier. I went as a poor person. I didn’t want to be alone.
The first thing I found out is that poor people are herded, controlled, treated like children. We had to wait outside the church in the mild cold until permitted to enter, in a kind of line. So I sit down.  I will never forget the beatific smiles of the volunteers that served us.  This was performance art, and they were the stars.  Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this, I’m sure. So the meal ends. I walk back into the dish room, survey the situation, once again kick out whoever was pretending to do the dishes, do the dishes, and leave.</span>

                              <span>&gt; Apparently there’s more cause, effect, and sequencing in diffusion models than what I expected
To temper this a bit, you may want to pay close attention to the demo videos. The player rarely backtracks, and for good reason - the few times the character does turn around and look back at something a second time, it has changed significantly (the most noticeable I think is the room with the grey wall and triangle sign).
This falls in line with how we&#x27;d expect a diffusion model to behave - it&#x27;s trained on many billions of frames of gameplay, so it&#x27;s very good at generating a plausible -next- frame of gameplay based on some previous frames. But it doesn&#x27;t deeply understand logical gameplay constraints, like remembering level geometry.</span>

                              <span>Last week the 2024 Democratic National Convention took over Chicago. Over the course of the week, the Democratic Party elite rubbed elbows and egos at the United Center and the McCormick Place Convention Center while outside, thousands gathered for meetings and marches, demonstrations and disruptions. CounterPunch Radio co-host and worker-owner at Chicago&#x27;s Pilsen Community Books, Erik Wallenberg, captured voices in the streets and Nathaniel St. Clair produced the episode.
We hear from leaders of the opposition including Cornel West and Medea Benjamin as well as protesters who organized against the 1968 DNC and came out in the streets this year too. A speech from Chicago for Abortion Rights leader Mandy Medley, music from Songs for Liberation, and words from Mennonites for Ceasefire ring out alongside members of Jewish Voice for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine, and Veterans Against the War. The episode closes out with a song, Fields of Palestine, which was performed by Ryan Cason, a member of Songs for Liberation and Irish Americans for Palestine. They adapted the Irish folk song, Fields of Athenry in solidarity with the struggle in Palestine. More

 If, for any number of reasons, you’d like to burn telecoms to the ground and build a new internet service provider on their smoldering remains, good news for you. New York City Spectrum workers, who’ve weathered an anguishing four-year strike, have built their own internet service provider. If the city throws its support behind it, People’s Choice Communications could liberate New Yorkers from cable gangsters once and for all. 
 The city itself is almost constantly fighting Spectrum. With its rise to dominance in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tried to evict it; attorneys general had to chase it around for allegedly defrauding…</span>

 Sweden is usually outside of The Beet’s purview, but the migrant workers at the heart of its growing shadow economy are not. In the construction sector in particular, many of these migrants hail from the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union’s collapse and they still use Russian as their lingua franca. To fight for their rights and combat exploitation, hundreds of these workers have formed Builders in Solidarity (Solidariska Byggare, in Swedish). Freelance journalist Volodya Vagner reports on this rapidly growing Russian-speaking union shaking up the Swedish labor movement. …</span>

 For most contemporaries, Michail Bakunin is unknown. If a certain number of people only know him by name, that is enough to hate and slander him. But there are some who love him with fervour. 
 Once Bakunin was truly a great name. While one would search in vain in the edition of the great encyclopedic dictionary published in 1866 for the name of Karl Marx, tha…</span>

                              <span>Dear Dad,
Today marks the first anniversary of your passing. Not a day goes... eeh, what’s that you said?
&quot;I know, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in.&quot;
Haha! Your sense of humor is intact. That&#x27;s still one of the first things people mention when your name comes up: your wonderful sense of humor, and how incredibly kind you were.
You truly treated everyone with the same care and respect.
I still remember the incident in the garden from when I was little. A drug addict had wandered in and fallen asleep there. Mom and all of us kids stood at a safe distance, nervously watching as you helped him. Before staggering off, he turned around with tears of gratitude and asked:
&quot;Are you a priest?&quot;
That’s the kind of person you were. A helping hand and a life saver. A true hero.
As you know, your other son turns 50 today. But this day is not about birth or death. It’s a day of celebration and love. A day of unity, no matter the realm of residence.
Thank you for the long and wonderful time you gave us. Thank you for all the lovely memories that keep your spirit alive. Thank you for all the beautiful things you passed on to us.
I&#x27;ll end with your last words:
I love you!</span>

                              <span>We’re finally back home.
I’ve had a really good few days (since Friday) break. We did a lot in a relatively short amount of time.
So many indicators of a memorable time.
Tan lines in random places to indicate getting that much needed Vitamin D.
Photographs that froze time to be remembered and printed.
(Enamel) Pins added to my collection of places visited.
Stickers. All of the stickers, even though pins have replaced that obsession.
A couple of library cards to show that even during vacation, I still think about all of the books to be read in the future.
Memories of full bellies because we ate a lot of really yummy food.
I’m still processing everything. I’ll be posting all of the photos in the future, whether it be on here, or on the photoblog.
Last day of my very short “vacation” today.
I woke up this morning after having dreamt of work, with tears in my eyes. Is it respectable for me to throw a tantrum to show that I really don’t want to go back to work tomorrow?
Probably not. For today, I’m going to try really hard to just not think about it.
Vacation is not over until it’s over.

                              <span>So, this is surprising. Apparently there’s more cause, effect, and sequencing in diffusion models than what I expected, which would be roughly ‘none’. Google here uses SD 1.4, as the core of the diffusion model, which is a nice reminder that open models are useful to even giant cloud monopolies.
The two main things of note I took away from the summary were: 1) they got infinite training data using agents playing doom (makes sense), and 2) they added Gaussian noise to source frames and rewarded the agent for ‘correcting’ sequential frames back, and said this was critical to get long range stable ‘rendering’ out of the model.
That last is intriguing — they explain the intuition as teaching the model to do error correction / guide it to be stable.
Finally, I wonder if this model would be easy to fine tune for ‘photo realistic’ / ray traced restyling — I’d be super curious to see how hard it would be to get a ‘nicer’ rendering out of this model, treating it as a doom foundation model of sorts.
Anyway, a fun idea that worked! Love those.</span>

                              <span>I worked on Mono a lot back in the early 2000s (back in the SVN days before it moved to Git, even). This move makes a lot of sense. Things evolved a lot over the years. Mono&#x27;s legacy goals, which are to be a portable CLR (.NET) runtime for platforms that Microsoft didn&#x27;t care about, don&#x27;t make much sense today.
Mono made a lot of sense for running places where full .NET didn&#x27;t, like in full AOT environments like on the iPhone where you can&#x27;t JIT, or for random architectures that don&#x27;t matter anymore but once did for Linux (Alpha, Itanium, PPC, MIPs, etc.). When Microsoft bought Xamarin (which itself was born out of the ashes of the Novell shutdown of the Mono effort) and started the DotNET Core efforts to make .NET more portable itself and less a system-provided framework and merge in a lot of the stuff Mono did a single more focused project made more sense.
Mono was still left out there to support the edge cases where DotNET Core didn&#x27;t make sense, which was mostly things like being a backend for Wine stuff in some cases, some GNOME Desktop stuff (via GTK#, which is pretty dead now), and older niche use cases (second life and Unity still embed mono as a runtime for their systems). The project was limping, though, and sharing a standard library but different runtimes after much merging. Mono&#x27;s runtime was always a little more portable (C instead of C++) and more accessible to experiment with, but we need that less and less, but it&#x27;s still perfect for Wine. So, having it live on in Wine makes sense. It&#x27;s a natural fit.</span>

I ignored it and then it started showing me pictures of women whose nipples were obviously showing through their clothing, which was an improvement, but still not the reason I signed up for Facebook. I&#x27;ve always understood it as the algorithm is looking for engagement and will try some lowest common denominator tactics to engage in it. As someone who just wanted to see the odd picture of a friend or relative, I don&#x27;t have much use for Facebook these days.</span>

The &quot;you can&#x27;t be 100% sure&quot; argument is impossible to defeat, and I don&#x27;t think this design will move the needle.
It also provides the argument that wanting to bury reactors 1 mile deep shows how incredibly dangerous nuclear power really is.</span>

                              <span>I read a lot. Probably more than a lot of people, but still not as much as some.
When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it&#x27;s just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less growing up. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn&#x27;t unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library&#x27;s entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with a local library card to start with. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I&#x27;m a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards &#x3D; even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.

People in the first world take having fun very seriously. We sure spend enough money on it. Some kinds of fun are pricing themselves out of the middle-class range. Tickets and all that goes with them (parking, food, souvenirs) to major league sports and top-tier concerts can easily take a family outing into four figures. A day at a Disney theme park for a family of four is well over $1000.
I&#x27;ve never been to a Disney Park, and my last concert was 15 years ago. I guess I&#x27;ll die without seeing Bruce Springsteen. I heard the other day that he&#x27;s reached billionaire status, and I&#x27;m not giving a billionaire any of my dough to be entertained for three hours, no matter how good a showman he is. I enjoy amateur and minor league sports. Hell, I like watching my grandson&#x27;s socce…</span>

&gt; &quot;Now back in the early days of this country, when they moved heavy objects around, they didn&#x27;t have any Caterpillar tractors, they didn&#x27;t have any big cranes. They used oxen. And when they got a great big log on the ground, and one ox couldn&#x27;t budge the darn thing, they did not try to grow a bigger ox. They used two oxen! And I think they&#x27;re trying to tell us something. When we need greater computer power, the answer is not &quot;get a bigger computer&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;get another computer&quot;. Which of course, is what common sense would have told us to begin with.&quot;</span>

A manager _can_ contact an employee on a Sunday, but then the employee is immediately on weekend-rate overtime even if they just got an email with &quot;deal with this next week&quot;. So, many companies have systems that hold back e-mail sent outside of working hours until the next working day unless specially authorised and costed.

                              <span>I know what you’re thinking:
“Not another blog challenge!”
But hear me out...
There’s been a debate lately about the existence or non-existence of blog challenges. The criticism has been that quantity takes precedence over quality. Even though there haven’t been any requirements for daily posts, it’s sort of become the norm to post every day.
With that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A &quot;challenge&quot; where quality comes first – and only.
The idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your &quot;best&quot; during the month.
The post that...
...you are most proud of.
...was the hardest to write.
...is the most personal.
...best represents you.
...made you think in new ways.
Or whatever you base &quot;best&quot; on. Your favorite, simply put.
Why this challenge?
As a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.
If you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.
Please note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.

Today, the plan is to bask in the sun, spend the day in one of the cutest towns, and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

...and of course, snapping photos of all of the things

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing this post based on Blaugust&#x27;s fifth-week theme, explaining some of the lessons I have learned through my participation in Blaugust this month. Here is the description of this week&#x27;s theme:
&quot;This week is a reminder that the goal of Blaugust is to refresh the content creators out there for the coming year, and not to burn them out in the process. Some folks are going to cross the finish line and immediately go dormant and others will want to process their thoughts about the proceedings. This space is reserved as a bit of a cooldown lap so that you can share your own experiences.&quot;
As mentioned above, Blaugust&#x27;s goal is to refresh content creators and not burn them out. As such, for this last week of August, I will not be forcing myself to write on a certain day if I don&#x27;t feel up …</span>

                              <span>If I have one favorite thing in the whole world to think about, it&#x27;s me. Left to my own devices, I am definitely my own favorite thing to contemplate. I&#x27;m constantly evaluating whether I feel good enough and if not, what I can do to rectify that situation. Do I need a snack? Maybe some cell phone time is called for. Maybe I am working too hard, and I need a break. Are people treating me with enough respect? Are my co-workers doing their fair share of tasks? Are raises coming up? Will I get what I deserve?
If I had the power to do one thing to my worst enemy, I would make that bastard as self-centered as possible, because brothers and sisters, let me tell you, a self-centered existence is a miserable existence. Until I was 43, the answer to the internal question &quot;Do I feel good enough?&quot; was…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this calculator was good or bad, but the rationale sounds superficially ridiculous.
&gt; Visitors who didn&#x27;t see the calculator were 16% more likely to sign up and 90% more likely to contact us than those who saw it. There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.
Of course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That&#x27;s not something you will figure out from a short-term A/B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.
I see this dynamic frequently with A/B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A/B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through. The question of which is actually better seemed to have been totally forgotten.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dabbled in management a few times in my career. This meant attending manager-only meetings and trainings. I&#x27;ll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, &quot;The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they&#x27;ll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else.&quot; This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.
After I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I&#x27;d need to be &quot;one of them.&quot; I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.
I know not every manager is like that. I&#x27;d like to think I wasn&#x27;t. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.</span>

                              <span>In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.
The Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.
The report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.
Indeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he&#x27;d done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.</span>

The idea is a syscall for getting a ringbuffer for any supported file descriptor, including pipes - and for pipes, if both ends support using the ringbuffer they&#x27;ll map the same ringbuffer: zero copy IO, potentially without calling into the kernel at all.
Would love to find collaborators for this one :)</span>

In beautiful EU bureaucratic style It&#x27;s a framework for how to talk about how a European Cloud could look like.
It&#x27;s not about technical standards. It&#x27;s about how we can talk about how we can think of maybe eventually deciding on how we can come up with standards that might one day lead to talk about implementations.
It represents to me everything that is wrong with the EU today. A bureaucratic monster that can&#x27;t decide how to talk about things or come to any form of alignment.</span>

Telegram didn&#x27;t have encrypted groups by default, and telegram possessed a lot of content on their servers that they had been made aware was illegal and didn&#x27;t cooperate. Nothing more, nothing less.
The comparisons to other providers is off base because either other providers are cooperating more when they possess actionable, unencrypted information and taking steps to detect or prevent such recurrences or they are like Signal and do not have access to the underlying material in the first place or store it for very long anyway.
One cannot legally run a hosted, unmoderated content platform in the developed world, one will always be required to remove illegal materials and turn over materials in cooperation with law enforcement.</span>

                              <span>This seems like the Kim Dotcom situation again.
Why are these service providers being punished for what their users do? Specifically, these service providers? Because Google, Discord, Reddit, etc. all  contain some amount of CSAM (and other illegal content), yet I don&#x27;t see Pichai, Citron, or Huffman getting indicted for anything.
Hell, then there&#x27;s the actual infrastructure providers too. This seems like a slippery slope with no defined boundaries where the government can just arbitrary use to pin the blame on the people they don&#x27;t like. Because ultimately, almost every platform with user-provided content will have some quantity of illegal material.
But maybe I&#x27;m just being naive?</span>

                              <span>Hey guys! We&#x27;re engineers/designers from France, and we&#x27;ve built the Ultimate DIY Battery that you can repair and refill!
It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike?
We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence!
Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it:
- What is the Gouach Battery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NsuW1NPkvNk
- Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mLoCihE0eIA
- Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EDJpt7RDbRM
Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com
We&#x27;d love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community
Oh, and it&#x27;s launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery!

                              <span>You just have to double check the results whenever you tell Claude to extract lists and data.
99.9% of it will be correct, but sometimes 1 or 2 records are off. This kind of error  is especially hard to notice because  you&#x27;re so impressed that Claude managed to do the extract task at all --  plus the results look wholly plausible upon eyeballing -- that you wouldn&#x27;t expect anything to be wrong at all.
But LLMs can get things ever slightly wrong when it comes to long lists/tables. I&#x27;ve been bitten by this before.
Trust but verify.
(edit: if the answer is &quot;machine verifiable&quot;, one approach  to ask an LLM to write a Python validator which it can execute internally. ChatGPT can execute code. I believe Sonnet 3.5 can too, but I haven&#x27;t tried.)</span>

                              <span>Today marks two years since closing on our house in the San Francisco Bay Area (California). It feels both like it just happened yesterday, and a lifetime ago.
Buying this house was not the easiest. During the entire nightmare of a process, I remember thinking that I wanted to blog about it (I wasn’t writing yet then) in detail, so that all first time homebuyers could avoid the stress we endured. Also, no one ever teaches you any of this in school, so I’m not exactly sure how anyone could know the process until they’re knees deep in it already.
Yes, there are plenty of articles out there about the house buying process, but it still doesn’t truly prepare you for the real thing. At least it didn’t for us.
I want to caveat that this house was not my first house. In 2012, I bought my first hou…</span>

The app solves many problems I have, but it solves each one poorly.
The app solves some problems I have and some that I don’t, making parts of it useless to me.
I don’t want what they call a Super-app. I want an app designed to solve something specific, one that has been thoughtfully crafted to address a particular need. This doesn’t mean that I want an app for every little thing. The “one thing” could also be a big thing; it just needs to be focused.</span>

I&#x27;ll often be stricken with a pang of jealousy. &quot;I want to write like that&quot;, I&#x27;ll tell myself, knowing that I won&#x27;t. Alas, I write like me.

 Everything fits together, from the bird whose brood is crushed to the humans whose nest is destroyed by war. 
 —Louise Michel 
 In this essay I explore the relations between contemporary anarchism and animal rights/liberation through the lens of Deleuze/Guattari-inflected complex systems theory. Specifically, I look at the liberalism and normative practices endemic to the mainstream animal rights movement, engaging with some of the more salient critiques that have emerged from Leftist an…</span>

Subtitle: The present, past and future of Bangladesh
Date: 24 July 2024
Notes: The writer is a member of the anarchist group Auraj network. Auraj (which means “anarchy” in Bangla) is an anarchist network of Bangladeshi students and other people from different professions. Auraj has published various translations of Anarchist thinkers such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, Rudolf Rocker, and others in Bangla. Auraj also frequently publishes articles on Bangladesh’s political and economic scenario. Auraj has shown solidarity with the recent labor movements (movements of garment workers, jute mill workers), student movements, and civil rights movements in Bangladesh. Although members of Auraj have individually taken part directly in many…</span>

Title: CNT on the re-foundation of the IWA
Subtitle: CNT-E’s XI Congress agreements on internationalism
Date: 5 April 2016
Source: Retrieved on 25th August 2024 from www.cnt.es

 The CNT would like to announce and explain the agreements made during our December 2015 Congress with regards to the current International Workers’ Association (IWA). We believe that it is necessary to explain our position on the drift of our international, so that this internal situation can be made publically known in order to openly and quickly begin the process of its re-foundation. 
 In the CNT we consider international solidarity to be critical in this historical moment, marked by the global organization of capitalism. As expected, the economic crisis has served as …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a kind of strategy game called Fall of an Empire (https://fallofanempiregame.com), it&#x27;s a bit like a mix between Crusader Kings, Total War, Mount and Blade type games (just the overworld, not the battles), but rather than expanding you&#x27;re trying to prevent an empire from collapsing.
It&#x27;s a ton of work, especially with the number of systems - you&#x27;ve got combat, resource management, settlement development, food managment, espionage, diplomacy etc - these all need to play together well. And then you&#x27;ve got to add in the storyline, graphics, marketing -but I think I&#x27;m making pretty good progress.
I&#x27;m still using Unreal Engine 4 because I started work on that version and I haven&#x27;t needed to upgrade to 5 since it&#x27;s been released.
I&#x27;ve got a free prologue that I&#x27;m releasing on October 1, so now until then is a lot of polishing to make it work well.</span>

                              <span>Boeing was awarded more money for their vehicle, had years of extra time and two previous demonstration flights. This flight should have been close to flawless given the additional time Boeing had for remediation and testing. Boeing engineers should have understood their systems well enough to convincingly demonstrate the vehicle met NASA&#x27;s safety requirements. Even after much additional testing during the flight they couldn&#x27;t make their case. Starliner will probably complete its third uncrewed return intact and people might question if NASA was being overly cautious but perhaps Boeing should have supplied a crewed vehicle with reliable thrusters and avoided this embarrassment.</span>

                              <span>Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.
As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.
Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.
And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.
Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.</span>

All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let&#x27;s give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn&#x27;t much to a determined spammer, but I didn&#x27;t want to be…</span>

                              <span>There are random days when I look at my blog and am tempted to scrap it all. It’s not because I hate it, or am unhappy with it, but mostly because I have this need and want to start all over again; a new slate if you will.
I start thinking: does this tiny corner of the internet I’ve created reflect who I am? Sometimes I’m OK with my answer, and then there are days when I’m not.
I’m not super happy with my dark mode color palette. I want to make changes to it but I don’t have a clue on what I want yet. I wish I can keep my theme on light mode, but I also don’t want to burn peoples retinas. The dark mode stays. Pending updates later.

                              <span>Today, I want to write about why I do this—why I wake up early and take the trouble to get up, go upstairs, and make some coffee. I’ve been wondering about this these past few days. Why make myself go through it? Why not just stay in bed and sleep an extra hour? Such a nice, soft, warm bed.
Every day I tell myself the same thing: “You’ll feel much better if you do!” And it’s true! I don’t know of any tonic that’s as good for my mood, energy, and mental health as a solid hour of writing in the morning before life starts. It feels like a luxury, really, having the time to do this, and I’m grateful. It’s just me, the sunrise, my dog sitting next to me, and the sound of the pen as it scratches meaning on paper, echoing in the silent dining room.

adopting a new (v1beta4) version of
its configuration file format. Configuration in the previous v1beta3 format is now formally
deprecated, which means it&#x27;s supported but you should migrate to v1beta4 and stop using
