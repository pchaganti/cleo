As J Streeters leave the Democratic National Convention fired up and ready to go, it’s clear we’re having a greater impact than ever.” He added that “the vice president’s remarks on Israel-Palestine were perhaps the clearest articulation of J Street’s values from a presidential nominee.” More

                              <span>I worked on Mono a lot back in the early 2000s (back in the SVN days before it moved to Git, even). This move makes a lot of sense. Things evolved a lot over the years. Mono&#x27;s legacy goals, which are to be a portable CLR (.NET) runtime for platforms that Microsoft didn&#x27;t care about, don&#x27;t make much sense today.
Mono made a lot of sense for running places where full .NET didn&#x27;t, like in full AOT environments like on the iPhone where you can&#x27;t JIT, or for random architectures that don&#x27;t matter anymore but once did for Linux (Alpha, Itanium, PPC, MIPs, etc.). When Microsoft bought Xamarin (which itself was born out of the ashes of the Novell shutdown of the Mono effort) and started the DotNET Core efforts to make .NET more portable itself and less a system-provided framework and merge in a lot of the stuff Mono did a single more focused project made more sense.
Mono was still left out there to support the edge cases where DotNET Core didn&#x27;t make sense, which was mostly things like being a backend for Wine stuff in some cases, some GNOME Desktop stuff (via GTK#, which is pretty dead now), and older niche use cases (second life and Unity still embed mono as a runtime for their systems). The project was limping, though, and sharing a standard library but different runtimes after much merging. Mono&#x27;s runtime was always a little more portable (C instead of C++) and more accessible to experiment with, but we need that less and less, but it&#x27;s still perfect for Wine. So, having it live on in Wine makes sense. It&#x27;s a natural fit.</span>

It also provides the argument that wanting to bury reactors 1 mile deep shows how incredibly dangerous nuclear power really is.</span>

                              <span>I read a lot. Probably more than a lot of people, but still not as much as some.
When you read a lot, libraries can become your best friend. Although I would love to buy all of the books, it&#x27;s just not sustainable. As much as I love having a physical collection, there are times when just borrowing a book over buying it, makes more sense.
I loved visiting libraries growing up. There was one next to my middle school that I would go to after school. I remember getting lost in the pages of a book, tucked in a corner between shelves.
I went to libraries less and less growing up. Then e-books happened. I still read a lot, and found myself buying most of the e-books I read. At some point, I got a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Despite its name, the book selection really wasn&#x27;t unlimited, especially if you read outside of the genre of their book offerings.
Enter Libby.
If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, Libby is a game changer for anyone who loves reading. All you need is a library card, and suddenly you have access to the library&#x27;s entire e-book collection.
I started a Libby account with a local library card to start with. Simple enough, right? But then I had an epiphany: as long as I&#x27;m a California resident, I can get different library cards across the state. Now that is the real game changer. More library cards &#x3D; even more selection of books.
Now, every time I visit a new California town, I try to stop by their library to get a card. Yesterday, we visited a new town for my birthday. We passed a library while roaming around town. Guess what I did?
I got myself yet another library card.
Thinking about collecting all of the cards up and down California at this point. A librarian Thanos, if you will.

People in the first world take having fun very seriously. We sure spend enough money on it. Some kinds of fun are pricing themselves out of the middle-class range. Tickets and all that goes with them (parking, food, souvenirs) to major league sports and top-tier concerts can easily take a family outing into four figures. A day at a Disney theme park for a family of four is well over $1000.
I&#x27;ve never been to a Disney Park, and my last concert was 15 years ago. I guess I&#x27;ll die without seeing Bruce Springsteen. I heard the other day that he&#x27;s reached billionaire status, and I&#x27;m not giving a billionaire any of my dough to be entertained for three hours, no matter how good a showman he is. I enjoy amateur and minor league sports. Hell, I like watching my grandson&#x27;s socce…</span>

&gt; &quot;Now back in the early days of this country, when they moved heavy objects around, they didn&#x27;t have any Caterpillar tractors, they didn&#x27;t have any big cranes. They used oxen. And when they got a great big log on the ground, and one ox couldn&#x27;t budge the darn thing, they did not try to grow a bigger ox. They used two oxen! And I think they&#x27;re trying to tell us something. When we need greater computer power, the answer is not &quot;get a bigger computer&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;get another computer&quot;. Which of course, is what common sense would have told us to begin with.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I like the Swiss implementation of this. A manager _can_ contact an employee on a Sunday, but then the employee is immediately on weekend-rate overtime even if they just got an email with &quot;deal with this next week&quot;. So, many companies have systems that hold back e-mail sent outside of working hours until the next working day unless specially authorised and costed.
Never underestimate an economics-based solution to a legal problem, a.k.a. &quot;if you really want to ban it, tax it&quot;.</span>

                              <span>I know what you’re thinking:
“Not another blog challenge!”
But hear me out...
There’s been a debate lately about the existence or non-existence of blog challenges. The criticism has been that quantity takes precedence over quality. Even though there haven’t been any requirements for daily posts, it’s sort of become the norm to post every day.
With that in mind, I propose a kind of anti-challenge for the month of September. A &quot;challenge&quot; where quality comes first – and only.
The idea is to blog in the way you normally do. Whether that’s one post every two weeks or two a day doesn’t matter. Then, at the end of September, you choose the text that you think was your &quot;best&quot; during the month.
The post that...
...you are most proud of.
...was the hardest to write.
...is the most personal.
...best represents you.
...made you think in new ways.
Or whatever you base &quot;best&quot; on. Your favorite, simply put.
Why this challenge?
As a reader, perhaps someone visiting your blog for the first time, it gives a good picture of who you are as a blogger. This no-pressure approach might also lead your writing into new unexplored territory. Diving back into the ideas and perspectives that resonated with you most can offer fresh and valuable insights.
If you want to join SeptemBest, as I’ve chosen to call it, contact me and I’ll add you to the list below. Then come back to me on October 1st with your “winning text,” and it will be added here along with the rest of the contributions.
Please note: I really want to emphasize that this is not a competition, despite the name. The idea is for it to be a fun, low-pressure, and interesting exploration on a personal level.

That&#x27;s it.
That&#x27;s the post.
A reflection post upcoming at some point, but not today.
Today, the plan is to bask in the sun, spend the day in one of the cutest towns, and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

...and of course, snapping photos of all of the things

                              <span>I&#x27;m writing this post based on Blaugust&#x27;s fifth-week theme, explaining some of the lessons I have learned through my participation in Blaugust this month. Here is the description of this week&#x27;s theme:
&quot;This week is a reminder that the goal of Blaugust is to refresh the content creators out there for the coming year, and not to burn them out in the process. Some folks are going to cross the finish line and immediately go dormant and others will want to process their thoughts about the proceedings. This space is reserved as a bit of a cooldown lap so that you can share your own experiences.&quot;
As mentioned above, Blaugust&#x27;s goal is to refresh content creators and not burn them out. As such, for this last week of August, I will not be forcing myself to write on a certain day if I don&#x27;t feel up …</span>

                              <span>If I have one favorite thing in the whole world to think about, it&#x27;s me. Left to my own devices, I am definitely my own favorite thing to contemplate. I&#x27;m constantly evaluating whether I feel good enough and if not, what I can do to rectify that situation. Do I need a snack? Maybe some cell phone time is called for. Maybe I am working too hard, and I need a break. Are people treating me with enough respect? Are my co-workers doing their fair share of tasks? Are raises coming up? Will I get what I deserve?
If I had the power to do one thing to my worst enemy, I would make that bastard as self-centered as possible, because brothers and sisters, let me tell you, a self-centered existence is a miserable existence.

Trump claimed not to know who was behind Project 2025; however, a CNN review found that at least 140 people who worked for him were involved. The  More

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this calculator was good or bad, but the rationale sounds superficially ridiculous.
&gt; Visitors who didn&#x27;t see the calculator were 16% more likely to sign up and 90% more likely to contact us than those who saw it. There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.
Of course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That&#x27;s not something you will figure out from a short-term A/B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.
I see this dynamic frequently with A/B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A/B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through. The question of which is actually better seemed to have been totally forgotten.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dabbled in management a few times in my career. This meant attending manager-only meetings and trainings. I&#x27;ll never forget one time when a manager in a focus group said something along the lines of, &quot;The tech sector is going through a rough patch, so we can turn the screws on our employees and they&#x27;ll have to take it because they will have a hard time trying to find a job somewhere else.&quot; This is at a company where most of the employees are on work visas, so losing their job can very rapidly escalate into having to leave the country in short order.
After I picked my jaw up off the floor I realized I simply lacked the scruples I&#x27;d need to be &quot;one of them.&quot; I also started looking into every legal protection I had available to me in my jurisdiction.
I know not every manager is like that. I&#x27;d like to think I wasn&#x27;t. But there are enough of them that think that way that legal protections often need to be there.</span>

                              <span>In general, courts have held that Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination pertain to testimonial evidence, not broadly to any possible evidence that might be incriminating.
The Fifth Amendment does not extend to physical evidence or other non-testimonial evidence, even if such evidence is potentially incriminating. For example, courts have held that things like blood samples, fingerprints, handwriting samples, and even video or audio recordings do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment because they are not considered testimonial in nature.
The report notes that it is the police chief, not a lawyer representing him, who is making the preposterous argument that the Fifth Amendment justifies his conduct.  Any lawyer who tried to make that argument would be made a laughing stock.
Indeed, I would think that this internal affairs report, where the chief is essentially admitting that he knew he&#x27;d done something wrong and was trying to prevent incriminating evidence from being recorded, would be pretty damning in front of a jury, because it establishes that he was well aware of the recklessness of his conduct.</span>

The idea is a syscall for getting a ringbuffer for any supported file descriptor, including pipes - and for pipes, if both ends support using the ringbuffer they&#x27;ll map the same ringbuffer: zero copy IO, potentially without calling into the kernel at all.

                              <span>Gaia-X is a disaster. The article misrepresents it. Gaia-X is not a framework for what a European cloud should look like. This would be useful.
In beautiful EU bureaucratic style It&#x27;s a framework for how to talk about how a European Cloud could look like.
It&#x27;s not about technical standards. It&#x27;s about how we can talk about how we can think of maybe eventually deciding on how we can come up with standards that might one day lead to talk about implementations.
It represents to me everything that is wrong with the EU today. A bureaucratic monster that can&#x27;t decide how to talk about things or come to any form of alignment.</span>

                              <span>A lot of really terrible takes in this comment section. Telegram didn&#x27;t have encrypted groups by default, and telegram possessed a lot of content on their servers that they had been made aware was illegal and didn&#x27;t cooperate. Nothing more, nothing less.
The comparisons to other providers is off base because either other providers are cooperating more when they possess actionable, unencrypted information and taking steps to detect or prevent such recurrences or they are like Signal and do not have access to the underlying material in the first place or store it for very long anyway.
One cannot legally run a hosted, unmoderated content platform in the developed world, one will always be required to remove illegal materials and turn over materials in cooperation with law enforcement.</span>

                              <span>This seems like the Kim Dotcom situation again.
Why are these service providers being punished for what their users do? Specifically, these service providers? Because Google, Discord, Reddit, etc. all  contain some amount of CSAM (and other illegal content), yet I don&#x27;t see Pichai, Citron, or Huffman getting indicted for anything.
Hell, then there&#x27;s the actual infrastructure providers too. This seems like a slippery slope with no defined boundaries where the government can just arbitrary use to pin the blame on the people they don&#x27;t like. Because ultimately, almost every platform with user-provided content will have some quantity of illegal material.
But maybe I&#x27;m just being naive?</span>

                              <span>Hey guys! We&#x27;re engineers/designers from France, and we&#x27;ve built the Ultimate DIY Battery that you can repair and refill!
It works with 90% of the bikes/motor brands on the market, so I assumed that some people here might be interested, if they got a non-functional batteries but they still want to use their e-bike?
We believe that everybody should have control about stuff they own, and we should fight against planned obsolescence!
Here are a few videos about our founder on the battery itself, why we built it, and how to assemble it:
- What is the Gouach Battery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NsuW1NPkvNk
- Presentation of the pack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mLoCihE0eIA
- Presentation of the fireproof and waterproof casing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EDJpt7RDbRM
Here are the juicy bits: https://docs.gouach.com
We&#x27;d love some feedback from the e-bike DIY builder community
Oh, and it&#x27;s launching as a Kickstarter in September and there is an offer for early-backers here https://get.gouach.com/1 for a 25% discount on the battery!

                              <span>You just have to double check the results whenever you tell Claude to extract lists and data.
99.9% of it will be correct, but sometimes 1 or 2 records are off. This kind of error  is especially hard to notice because  you&#x27;re so impressed that Claude managed to do the extract task at all --  plus the results look wholly plausible upon eyeballing -- that you wouldn&#x27;t expect anything to be wrong at all.
But LLMs can get things ever slightly wrong when it comes to long lists/tables. I&#x27;ve been bitten by this before.
Trust but verify.
(edit: if the answer is &quot;machine verifiable&quot;, one approach  to ask an LLM to write a Python validator which it can execute internally. ChatGPT can execute code. I believe Sonnet 3.5 can too, but I haven&#x27;t tried.)</span>

Buying this house was not the easiest. During the entire nightmare of a process, I remember thinking that I wanted to blog about it (I wasn’t writing yet then) in detail, so that all first time homebuyers could avoid the stress we endured. Also, no one ever teaches you any of this in school, so I’m not exactly sure how anyone could know the process until they’re knees deep in it already.
Yes, there are plenty of articles out there about the house buying process, but it still doesn’t truly prepare you for the real thing. At least it didn’t for us.
I want to caveat that this house was not my first house. In 2012, I bought my first hou…</span>

I don’t want what they call a Super-app. I want an app designed to solve something specific, one that has been thoughtfully crafted to address a particular need.

I might get some inspiration or an idea for a day&#x27;s entry from one of my favorite bloggers, but I&#x27;m never going to be them.

Subtitle: Contemporary Anarchism, Animal Liberation and the Implications of New Philosophy
Source: Chapter from ‘Anarchism and Animal Liberation: Essays on Complementary Elements of Total Liberation’ (ISBN: 0786494573). 

 Everything fits together, from the bird whose brood is crushed to the humans whose nest is destroyed by war. 
 —Louise Michel 
 In this essay I explore the relations between contemporary anarchism and animal rights/liberation through the lens of Deleuze/Guattari-inflected complex systems theory. Specifically, I look at the liberalism and normative practices endemic to the mainstream animal rights movement, engaging with some of the more salient critiques that have emerged from Leftist an…</span>

Title: People’s uprising against an autocratic state
Subtitle: The present, past and future of Bangladesh

Notes: The writer is a member of the anarchist group Auraj network. Auraj (which means “anarchy” in Bangla) is an anarchist network of Bangladeshi students and other people from different professions. Auraj has published various translations of Anarchist thinkers such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, Rudolf Rocker, and others in Bangla. Auraj also frequently publishes articles on Bangladesh’s political and economic scenario. Auraj has shown solidarity with the recent labor movements (movements of garment workers, jute mill workers), student movements, and civil rights movements in Bangladesh.

Title: CNT on the re-foundation of the IWA
Subtitle: CNT-E’s XI Congress agreements on internationalism
Date: 5 April 2016
Source: Retrieved on 25th August 2024 from www.cnt.es

 The CNT would like to announce and explain the agreements made during our December 2015 Congress with regards to the current International Workers’ Association (IWA). We believe that it is necessary to explain our position on the drift of our international, so that this internal situation can be made publically known in order to openly and quickly begin the process of its re-foundation. 
 In the CNT we consider international solidarity to be critical in this historical moment, marked by the global organization of capitalism. As expected, the economic crisis has served as …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a kind of strategy game called Fall of an Empire (https://fallofanempiregame.com), it&#x27;s a bit like a mix between Crusader Kings, Total War, Mount and Blade type games (just the overworld, not the battles), but rather than expanding you&#x27;re trying to prevent an empire from collapsing.
It&#x27;s a ton of work, especially with the number of systems - you&#x27;ve got combat, resource management, settlement development, food managment, espionage, diplomacy etc - these all need to play together well. And then you&#x27;ve got to add in the storyline, graphics, marketing -but I think I&#x27;m making pretty good progress.
I&#x27;m still using Unreal Engine 4 because I started work on that version and I haven&#x27;t needed to upgrade to 5 since it&#x27;s been released.
I&#x27;ve got a free prologue that I&#x27;m releasing on October 1, so now until then is a lot of polishing to make it work well.</span>

                              <span>Boeing was awarded more money for their vehicle, had years of extra time and two previous demonstration flights. This flight should have been close to flawless given the additional time Boeing had for remediation and testing. Boeing engineers should have understood their systems well enough to convincingly demonstrate the vehicle met NASA&#x27;s safety requirements. Even after much additional testing during the flight they couldn&#x27;t make their case. Starliner will probably complete its third uncrewed return intact and people might question if NASA was being overly cautious but perhaps Boeing should have supplied a crewed vehicle with reliable thrusters and avoided this embarrassment.</span>

                              <span>Lovely article, though honestly getting those prerequisites also takes a lot of time, effort and either motivation or discipline in ample amounts.
As someone who was the “smart kid” growing up, going to the university without good work ethic was pretty eye opening, no longer being able to coast on intuitively getting subjects, but rather either having to put in a bunch of effort while feeling both humbled and dumb at times, or just having to sink academically.
Even after getting through that more or less successfully and having an okay career so far, I still definitely struggle with both physical health and mental health, both of which make the process of learning new things harder and slower than just drinking a caffeinated beverage of choice and grokking a subject over a long weekend. Sometimes it feels like trying to push a rock up a muddy slope.
And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.
Admittedly, some people just feel like they’re built different. Even if I didn’t have those things slowing me down as much (working on it), I’d still be nowhere near as cool as people who dive headfirst into low level programming, electrical engineering, write their own simulations, rendering or even whole game engines and such. Maybe I’m just exposed to what some brilliant people can do thanks to the Internet, but some just manage to do amazing things.</span>

                              <span>Reddit was my favorite website growing up. I&#x27;d discover new interesting subs, read random posts and comments. The frontpage was somewhat interesting too, but now it feels like a bot fest and propaganda machine.
I still use Reddit but way less than I used to before, and I no longer use it for fun but just to read niche tech subs.
I refuse to use the official mobile app. I&#x27;ve always used Baconreader and then Relay on Android. Relay survived the API changes and adopted a subscription model.
But thanks to Revanced I was able to patch an old version of Relay to use my own API key for free.</span>

                              <span>I swear, MS kills all the useful features in Windows.
For comparison, configuring a network interface using Control Panel is simple, straight forward and allows me to change all the settings I want. Trying to do the same thing using the Settings app is complex, it hides pretty nuch all of the advanced settings that you want to see or change. And on top of that, it doesn’t even show you how long that interface has been connected to the network and how much data was transferred both ways: incredible debugging info lost.
Oh, and the fact that you can’t tick which updates you want and which you don’t…
I’m pretty sure others have other gripes with the “streamlined experience”.</span>

I&#x27;m often grateful for some of life&#x27;s little comforts over and over again, things like a good meal I didn&#x27;t have to cook or an especially entertaining show on TV. A long time ago, I read The Miracle of Mindfulness by Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh in which he encourages a junior monk to peel an orange while savoring the moment, to do nothing but feel and smell and taste the orange. When I have the presence of mind to do such things, I like to savor moments of small joy while they are happening and then to reflect on them afterwords. I&#x27;m not above escaping from my present reality at times and looking forward to something that&#x27;s hap…</span>

A week later, I got a Find My notification that they had been spotted – at the same sports field. I figured what the hell, put on a podcast and drove the hour to see if I could find them. Worst case scenario, a couple of hours of driving.
Using Find My and the directional feature points you in the right direction to within feet, I found them in the tall grass.
The case had been perfectly watertight, and they&#x27;d barely lost a percent of power in a week. Remarkable really all round.</span>

                              <span>A counter point on premium VR headsets. They are teleportation devices.
I&#x27;ve used every popular VR device, but one Vision Pro experience stood out - &#x27;The Haleakala environment&#x27;[1]
It was literally like being transported there. I know because I had been in that exact spot a few years before. I have a rich visual memory which served as reference, and no exaggeration, it felt like was there. I was immediately in tears. It was profound.
The Vision pro&#x27;s lack of a killer app because development is unintuitive, userbase is small, the UX is alien and the hardware costs of constructing these experience is still rather high. Give it a few years. The hardware is already there. This isn&#x27;t a solution in search of a problem. This is PalmOS, a solution that is too early to the market.
I have family with disabilities. Being able to teleport my loved ones to places they could never go themselves is worth the $3000. If I could record my most profound memories with &#x27;VR recorder&#x27;, I would. My parent missed my graduation because of being continents away. You think they wouldn&#x27;t want to be teleported to it ? Wedding photographers cost $4000+, so we can relive those memories through shoddy snapshots. Why not be teleported back to the most beautiful day ?
Don&#x27;t knock it till you try it.

                              <span>Similar experience: Citibank Retirement.
I had about $80,000 in IRA/CD&#x27;s. I&#x27;d created &amp; contributed to them over a period of 35 years.
Last year, it&#x27;s time to retire, and Citibank won&#x27;t give me half the money.  It seems that some CD&#x27;s are for &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; and some for &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Citibank Retirement demanded a &quot;Marriage Certificate, Divorce Decree, or Court Order&quot; to demonstrate that &quot;Cliff Stoll&quot; is the same person as &quot;Clifford Stoll&quot;.
Took more than 8 months, dozens of emails, five visits to Citibank offices, and a letter to the Citibank president, to shake loose money that I&#x27;d deposited across three decades.</span>

                              <span>A friend found some AirPods on the ground and tapped them to his phone, revealing only the serial number and the last four digits of the owner&#x27;s number. He turned to me for help.
All Out
Could I really brute-force spam all phone numbers ending in 1234 and find the right owner? This seemed a bit impractical, so I had to think of ways to whittle the number down to something more manageable.
Area Code
I started with the assumption that the owner lived near me in the Portland metropolitan area. With that, I restricted the search to our local area code*. Sure, they could be from out of town, but hey, let&#x27;s give it a shot.
999 numbers is a manageable list, but I wanted to trim the number a bit more. Sure, sending a thousand SMS messages isn&#x27;t much to a determined spammer, but I didn&#x27;t want to be…</span>

                              <span>There are random days when I look at my blog and am tempted to scrap it all. It’s not because I hate it, or am unhappy with it, but mostly because I have this need and want to start all over again; a new slate if you will.
I start thinking: does this tiny corner of the internet I’ve created reflect who I am? Sometimes I’m OK with my answer, and then there are days when I’m not.
I’m not super happy with my dark mode color palette. I want to make changes to it but I don’t have a clue on what I want yet. I wish I can keep my theme on light mode, but I also don’t want to burn peoples retinas. The dark mode stays. Pending updates later.
Robert recently created a Bear theme, Bearming. This inspired me to make tiny changes to my page until I can figure out what I want.

                              <span>Today, I want to write about why I do this—why I wake up early and take the trouble to get up, go upstairs, and make some coffee. I’ve been wondering about this these past few days. Why make myself go through it? Why not just stay in bed and sleep an extra hour? Such a nice, soft, warm bed.
Every day I tell myself the same thing: “You’ll feel much better if you do!” And it’s true! I don’t know of any tonic that’s as good for my mood, energy, and mental health as a solid hour of writing in the morning before life starts. It feels like a luxury, really, having the time to do this, and I’m grateful. It’s just me, the sunrise, my dog sitting next to me, and the sound of the pen as it scratches meaning on paper, echoing in the silent dining room.
I’ve been writing this way for a bit over a year…</span>

                              <span>As part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release, kubeadm is
adopting a new (v1beta4) version of
its configuration file format. Configuration in the previous v1beta3 format is now formally
deprecated, which means it&#x27;s supported but you should migrate to v1beta4 and stop using
the deprecated format.
Support for v1beta3 configuration will be removed after a minimum of 3 Kubernetes minor releases.
In this article, I&#x27;ll walk you through key changes;
I&#x27;ll explain about the kubeadm v1beta4 configuration format,
and how to migrate from v1beta3 to v1beta4.
You can read the reference for the v1beta4 configuration format:
kubeadm Configuration (v1beta4).

This version improves on the v1beta3
format by fixing some minor issues and adding a few new fields.

They say that home is where the heart is, and I wholeheartedly agree. A home doesn’t have to be a place, but if you had to put a place to it, where would you consider home to be?
My cousins, back in my birth country, will ask: “When are you coming home?” It always stops me in my tracks. I haven’t lived there for 32 years. I left when I was relatively young, and only visit every few years for a short period of time.

That&#x27;s a bold statement and I don&#x27;t mean for it to be. I definitely care about how people treat me and that&#x27;s often tied into their opinion so I&#x27;m not being an absolutist. Some things that a lot of people find important are of little interest to me, cars for example. I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry with 230K miles on it that is a hand me down from my mother. I&#x27;m almost 60. I also don&#x27;t try to appear neutral on controversial topics.

                              <span>There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, kubectl debug is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It
provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&#x27;s point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image&#x3D;busybox --profile&#x3D;netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific
necessities, and unfortunately, some can&#x27;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.

                              <span>This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.31 to improve the handling of supplementary groups in containers within Pods.
Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image
Although this behavior may not be popular with many Kubernetes cluster users/admins, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image.
Let&#x27;s see an example, below Pod specifies runAsUser&#x3D;1000, runAsGroup&#x3D;3000 and supplementalGroups&#x3D;4000 in the Pod&#x27;s security context.

Traditionally, Kubernetes&#x27; CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…</span>
