                              <span>Last week, the Department of Energy, which oversees the aging nuclear site in Hanford, Washington, reported that a tank containing high-level radioactive waste was leaking.  This is currently the third tank we know of that’s releasing deadly nuclear waste into the soil above the groundwater that feeds the nearby Columbia River. This is not a new problem for Hanford, which has 177 of these huge underground tanks that contain 55 million gallons of radioactive leftovers from the US’s nuclear weapons operation. These waste tanks were only supposed to hold up twenty-thirty years, and we’re now going on six decades. Below is an excerpt from my book Atomic Days, which details the site’s sordid history and its extremely problematic future. Sadly, leaks at Hanford are nothing new, nor are the lies surrounding them. It’s a looming nuclear danger that’s bubbling in our own backyard, and I’m scared. You should be too.  More

                              <span>Defenders of ruling elites have seldom been satisfied with the argument that the rich deserve their wealth because of their grudging willingness to provide jobs for everyone else. Very commonly, the tendency is to celebrate the rich and powerful as being different kinds of people from the rest of us—suggesting that they built their gigantic companies up from scratch by their own almost miraculously superior knowledge, relentless drive, and willingness to make tough calls.

                              <span>Armored trucks and rogue military officers filled La Paza’s central Plaza Murillo once again this past June in a failed coup attempt against Bolivian President Luis Arce. This right-wing effort at seizing power harkened back to 2019, when another coup successfully overthrew the government of President Evo Morales, leading to massacres and widespread repression. The 2019-2020 coup government of Jeanine Áñez was ultimately defeated by the country’s social movements and the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). More

Should their campaigns amplify the hysteria about an immigration “crisis,” or should they speak the truth to the American people about the border and the roots of migration? Even more important, these marchers are providing a practical way for activists and political leaders to advocate for rights as they work to defeat the threat of MAGA racism. More

I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to focus on the sort of platform-y work that I want to do. It&#x27;s going to be so much fun!
Of course, before I can get to the new gig I&#x27;ll spend the next three weeks wrapping up and/or handing off everything that I&#x27;d been working on for my current employer. It&#x27;s a good thing that past-John typically did a good job of documenting things as he went. Still, it&#x27;s going to be a busy few weeks!
Oh, and that other position that I interviewed for? I got rejected, and the company went on to break the entire world the following week. So I guess that one actually worked out pretty well for me, too.</span>

                              <span>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to work in IT anymore.&quot;
I saw this comment pop up on my Mastodon feed today. It really resonated with me, as I was in the same boat a few years ago.
I had a great job at a great company. The people were friendly, the boss was understanding, the pay was good, and it was a short walk from home. In short, it was perfect!
But over time, something started to feel off. I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it was. Everything ought to be great, which my family and friends were quick to point out when I told them how I felt.
Then one day, a window cleaner came to the office. I completely lost track of time watching him work. When I finally snapped out of it, I told him it looked like a peaceful job.
– Yes, I can&#x27;t imagine a better job, he replied cheerfully.
In that moment, a seed was planted. Six months later, I was on a plane to Bangkok for a sabbatical in Asia. It was such a rewarding experience!
When I got back, I explained to my employer that it was time for something new. He admired my adventurous spirit and completely understood.
Fast forward ten years, and here I am now. I love my current job as a house inspector, even though I still make less than I did back then.
And when it comes to IT, I&#x27;m more passionate about it now that it&#x27;s a hobby instead of a career. It&#x27;s fun again!
Are you happy with your job? If not, do what you can to change the situation. Life is too short and precious to spend a large part of it unhappy.

                              <span>Sometimes I get tired of formulating words to help things make sense. At work, I am either talking things through with someone, writing things down for someone to consume, or typing an email or some sort of message to someone.
I just want to be given time to process things without having to feel obligated to communicate it with anyone.
I’ve been craving silence, and the opportunity to just be. There are times I force my inner monologue to be quiet just so I can have some sort of silence. My mind is constantly running at 100mph, and finding peace even during sleep can be hard to come by.
I haven’t properly journaled in a few weeks because I haven’t had time to process things. I’ve been keeping very rushed day logs privately just to account happenings in my daily life, but that’s it. Keeping my DayOne streak alive.
I’ve been finding myself thinking too hard, and feeling too much.
My life has become such a broken record. It seems like I’m just repeating the same words to describe a multitude of feelings. My physical health has been at a steady decline and I’ve honestly been struggling just to push forward in the mornings.
Words, sentences, paragraphs. It’s just all too much.
Even this post has just way too many.

&quot;I know you might be worried about regrets later, but sometimes it&#x27;s okay to break the ritual, to interrupt the flow, to just pause and breathe it all in. No achievement is going to light up above your head when you write all the words, read all the books, collect all the things. Not one that&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run anyway. Be joyful when you can, be reflective when you need to be, but most of all, focus on being. If that means writing, great. If that means quiet, that&#x27;s great too.&quot; by Netigen

                              <span>There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, kubectl debug is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It
provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&#x27;s point of view,
debugging the node should be as easy as this:
$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image&#x3D;busybox --profile&#x3D;netadmin


On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use.
Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific
necessities, and unfortunately, some can&#x27;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.

                              <span>This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.31 to improve the handling of supplementary groups in containers within Pods.
Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image
Although this behavior may not be popular with many Kubernetes cluster users/admins, kubernetes, by default, merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image.
Let&#x27;s see an example, below Pod specifies runAsUser&#x3D;1000, runAsGroup&#x3D;3000 and supplementalGroups&#x3D;4000 in the Pod&#x27;s security context.

                              <span>In Kubernetes v1.31, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to CPU management capabilities: the distribute-cpus-across-cores option for the CPUManager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.
Understanding the feature
Traditionally, Kubernetes&#x27; CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.
While default approach minimizes inter-core communication and can be beneficial under certain sc…</span>

Theissen starts off by reminding of one of Larry Summers’ most embarrassing moments: “Nonetheless, as president of the Senate, Harris cast the deciding vote to pass the catastrophically misnamed ‘American Rescue Plan’ with only Democratic votes  More

                              <span>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new
Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
cgroupfs and systemd. In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a
source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!
Automated cgroup driver detection
In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. A few minor releases of Kubernetes
happened whilst we waited for support to land in the major two CRI implementations
(containerd and CRI-O), but as of v1.31.0, this feature is now beta!
In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:
containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0
CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0
Then, they should ensure their CRI implementation is configured to the
cgroup_driver they would like to use.
Future work
Eventually, support for the kubelet&#x27;s cgroupDriver configuration field will be
dropped, and the kubelet will fail to start if the CRI implementation isn&#x27;t new
enough to have support for this feature.</span>

                              <span>The message was simple: “I had a dream about you.” In my opinion, one of the sweetest things you can say to a person, followed up by something sentimental, absurd, or just plain disturbing.
This time, it was actually followed up by, “…Well I don’t remember much but we got hitched. Seemed like the right idea.”
My heart didn’t skip a beat, but I couldn’t help but smile. I have always thought that dreams have a way of drumming up the past, tying together old memories with bits of our subconscious. This was the kind of thing that could lead to a nice moment of reconnection, or an awkward ”thanks for letting me know.”
Surely, it wasn’t overly dramatic or romantic. Just two people enjoying each other’s company in that familiar, comforting way.
Sometimes dreams remind us of what was good, even if it wasn’t meant to be. They’re postcards from a past life- a plea of a “wish you were here,” far from any sense of urgency - but just letting you know “it was once beautiful.”
In all honesty, there’s something heartwarming in knowing that I wandered in someone’s dream- that even in the complex landscape of someone’s subconscious thoughts- there’s a place for me.
I just simply responded with, “It’s nice to know that I’m sweet enough to dream about. The food at the reception must have been good.”

I&#x27;m nearing that magic 100 posts. Though, of course, as is typical, I only started the 100DaysToOffload challenge half way through and am only on post 48 of the challenge itself. But hey, that&#x27;s okay.
I know I can be a prolific writer and love to talk about everything and anything. You can thank my family and a lack of TV in our house till much later than everyone else on the planet, for that. I can thank my parents for an inquisitive nature, an appetite for reading anything with print on it, and a love of science and nature, and the physical world around us. Funny how growing up without smart devices, TV, and only access to museums and libraries shaped who I am.

                              <span>&quot;What&#x27;s the secret?&quot;
I asked this question to one of my clients today. He was 85 years old, looked 60, and was as fit and agile as a 50-year-old.
He replied: &quot;There&#x27;s no secret. I enjoy walking. That’s all.&quot;
No secrets. No tricks. Completely natural.
But that&#x27;s often how it is, isn’t it; we think there&#x27;s a code to crack, a secret recipe to follow to achieve success. When in reality, the answer lies in the most natural thing in the world.
If we want to increase our chances of being in good shape, then we need to make sure we move around a bit. If we want to become a better writer, then we need to make sure we write a lot.
There&#x27;s no secret.</span>

                              <span>I’m currently outside, having a smoking break.
I don’t smoke.
For some reason, in office environments, it is mainly customary for smoking people to go outside during work hours for breaks.
Unless they go out to eat, non-smokers tend to remain in the office for the whole day, which frankly sounds unhealthy. Going outside for a short walk, or just to sit with your coffee in the outside air and sun, helps me to unwind a bit, get a little energy to help me with my work later.
It’s not that my workplace (or any of my previous office workplaces for that matter) won’t allow people to go outside, but somehow it’s rare for non-smokers to do so. When I went outside with other people, it was mainly with smokers for their smoking breaks.
I think breaks outside should be the norm for all people in jobs where it’s possible. If you can do it, I encourage you to try.

Around 2AM this morning I had a realization that this was the most stressed I have ever been. On verge of a complete breakdown.
Why? Because I noticed around 10PM that jumpcomedy.com was entirely broken with all HTTP POST calls made by RTK Query failing. Nothing worked and though I had deployed recent changes, none of them would cause this. I was at a complete loss as to where to look, especially as this is working locally. Posting on the usual Discords (NextJS, Vercel) is leading to dead silence. I&#x27;m alone and have to fix this issue which I didn&#x27;t cause.
This isn&#x27;t the first production defect I&#x27;ve introduced in my 25 years of working, but this is the first one where I had absolutely nobody to turn to in a time of crisis while customer complaints are pilin…</span>

                              <span>I no longer want to simply be a developer, an artist, or a sporty person. I’ve changed my mindset:
from &quot;I want to be a developer&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who enjoys tinkering with coding and tech every day,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be an artist&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who appreciates and creates art,&quot;
from &quot;I want to be a runner&quot; to &quot;I want to become someone who loves running and taking walks.&quot;
This shift in mindset helps me focus more on the process and the enjoyment of what I do, rather than being fixated on the end result. I’ve realized that I was too focused on the final outcome, neglecting more important things like the process, the joy in what I do, and being present in the moment.
I remind myself that becoming is a lifelong journey that never truly ends. We never completely become anything; we are always in the process of becoming. So, there’s no point in fixating on final results.
Just enjoy the path, stay on the path, and keep becoming.</span>

Vladislav was part of the “Siberian Battalion” of the International Legion, and he was martyred in a fight during a landing operation on the Kinburn Spit. 
 Before coming to Ukraine, Vladislav participated in actions of solidarity with anarchist and other anti-government prisoners. He fought against Russian fascism and imperialism. Knowing that anarchists in Ukraine…</span>

                              <span>Long-run trends in increased access to credit are thought to improve real activity. However, “rapid” credit expansions do not always end well and have been shown in the academic literature to predict adverse real outcomes such as lower GDP growth and an increased likelihood of crises. Given these financial stability considerations associated with rapid credit expansions, being able to distinguish in real time “good booms” from “bad booms” is of crucial interest for policymakers. While the recent literature has focused on understanding how the composition of borrowers helps distinguish good and bad booms, in this post we investigate how the composition of lending during a credit expansion matters for subsequent real outcomes.</span>

instead of SPDY for streaming.
This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs
matter.
Streaming APIs in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful
interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming
protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming
protocol provides a persistent connection that&#x27;s bi-directional, low-latency,
and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and
writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the
same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create
a shell in a running container from your local…</span>

Okay, today I am going to be discussing Zoom Video ($ZM) and how it&#x27;s incredibly &quot;cheap&quot;, at least on paper!
Let&#x27;s start with the obvious.
There are a few things that are important to understand for each company. How much cash they have, how much debt they have, and what is the market cap. These 3 things provide you with the ability to calculate the enterprise value (total value).
Let&#x27;s take a look at this sheet.

We can see that $ZM has $7.9 billion dollars worth of cash or cash equivalents (instruments that can be easily converted).
Zoom also has less than a billion dollars in debt - basically zero debt.
And finally, we can calculate the market cap (as of 8/19/24) which is just taking the share price and multiplying it by the outstanding shares. The market cap comes in around $1…</span>

Sure, you&#x27;ve learned. You might have explored a topic you&#x27;re curious about or spent countless hours on Wikipedia. And if your job, like mine, requires you to constantly update your knowledge, your answer might quickly shift to: &quot;all the time!&quot;
Please, re-read the question.
I didn&#x27;t ask when was the last time you learned something new. I&#x27;m talking about the act of studying: having a syllabus, a set of disciplines or areas you want to study, and the time to sit down and actually take notes, read books, and do exercises.
Maybe I&#x27;m alone in this feeling, but it&#x27;s been a while since I took the time to actually study while trying to juggle everything going on.
That&#x27;s why, from now on, I&#x27;m going to try to dedicate at least one hour to study every day.
I&#x27;m currently working on my syllabus, which I&#x27;ll gladly share with you once I&#x27;ve finished it. Feel free to do the same (maybe we can borrow some ideas from each other&#x27;s schedules).
Take a moment and think about the areas where you feel you lack knowledge. From ancient Greek culinary arts to quantum physics, pick the topics you really want to dedicate yourself to for the next 6 months.
I can&#x27;t wait to learn with you all.</span>

                              <span>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s July 2024 SCE Labor Market Survey shows a year-over-year increase in the average reservation wage—the lowest wage respondents would be willing to accept for a new job—to $81,147, but a decline from a series’ high of $81,822 in March 2024. In this post, we investigate how the recent dynamics of reservation wages differed across individuals and how reservation wages are related to individuals’ expectations about their future labor market movements.</span>

About Pod failure policy
When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons.
Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable
failures and continue running to completion.
To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the backoffLimit
field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&#x27;re willing to tolerate
during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the backoffLimit field
and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating
costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.
This becomes particularly problematic when running large-sc…</span>

Title: A Friend of Mine or a Friend of Ours?
Subtitle: An Essay On Vouching
Date: 2024/08/15

 Vouching means different things to different anarchists. For some, to vouch for a person means the vouchee is felt to be trustworthy and competent enough for an action. For others, vouching means that the voucher has concrete evidence of the trustworthiness and competence of the vouchee, and is willing to stake their reputation on that evidence. 
 To agree on whether to vouch for someone or not, we need to be clear about what we mean by vouching. We propose three components of a vouch that might be helpful in discussing that meaning: trustworthiness, competence, and the voucher&#x27;s reput…</span>

                              <span>A close friend of mine recently landed a new job and is now considering quitting.
It&#x27;s impossible to predict whether you&#x27;ll enjoy a workplace, but it usually becomes apparent soon after starting. If you consistently feel like &quot;this is the wrong place for me,&quot; I strongly believe you should quit as soon as possible. I&#x27;ve personally quit jobs within the first week.
Given that work occupies a significant portion of our lives, it&#x27;s crucial that it feels right. But the very fact that work constitutes a large part of our lives can also mislead us.
Besides work, we have relationships, hobbies, financial responsibilities, and our health to maintain. And, as we all know, life isn&#x27;t always a constant joyride. Relationships can strain, health can deteriorate, and unexpected financial problems can arise.
Life is often challenging. We feel down and want to feel better.
We seek solutions and try to identify what needs to change. We yearn for a quick fix, and it&#x27;s easy to blame work. Considering it occupies around a third of our daily lives, it&#x27;s not surprising that we hold our jobs accountable.
&quot;Yes, of course, it&#x27;s my workplace. There we have it. I gotta quit!&quot;
But is that really the root of the problem?
It might be partially, or not at all. Regardless, it&#x27;s never wise to make major decisions based on fleeting, fluctuating, and undefined emotions.
There&#x27;s usually no rush. It&#x27;s worth waiting a while. The most important thing is that it&#x27;s the right decision, whenever and whatever we decide.
You can&#x27;t eliminate ripples on water with a slap. Wait, and they will eventually subside. Against this still background, the correct answer will emerge.</span>

You are a museum.
~evie\
In essence, love is much like the art of curating a museum. We consider, assess, and most importantly choose the &quot;artifacts&quot; of most significance based on what we (uniquely) enjoy. The things we (uniquely) enjoy are informed by factors as varied and disparate as our blood-sugar levels, among other things. We carefully display our &quot;exhibit of love&quot; in beautiful frames and tags. &quot;This is so me.&quot;

I am enjoying writing these Week Notes on Saturday mornings as I drink my first cup of coffee. Today’s a late start since I’m still slightly under the weather but feeling a tiny bit better.
Took our friend CS down the coast while she was here this past weekend. Every year she visits from the east coast, we take her to a different part of the Bay (Area). Her first year, we explored the city (San Francisco), the second year we went to Point Reyes, and this year we went a little past Half Moon Bay. Pictures slowly incoming in the photo blog.
A co-worker turned friend recently started a blog. I’ve been talking about my blogging experience the past few months, and since she was looking to start something new, figured she’d try her hand in it. She’s currently t…</span>

 Back in probably 2004, maybe 2005, I was working in Portland, Oregon as a landscaper. It was a small crew, just three of us and our boss. Our boss was, for the most part, pretty cool. He didn’t work us to the bone. He was flexible about time off. He was down to call me Magpie. He paid us under the table. Sometimes he’d cancel work to go surfing. That kind of guy. 
 In fact, after my first week of work, I told him: “hey I’m going to leave for about a month to go block roads in Southern Oregon to stop this old growth timber sale, maybe do some treesitting. When I come back, can I have my job back?” and he said yes, an…</span>

 Fluctuations within a continuum can be generated from diverging narratives. Uncertain climes, alternative timelines. Chronoflipping, retroswitching, taleshifting. An alterverse created via timeforge. Terra incognita.
 Narratives serve the function of temporal modulators, unbound by the shackles of progress and linearity. Vectors of radivergence.

To mark these 80 years, we are republishing a series of articles every Wednesday until July, looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions. (...)

Intro
 When we pay attention to the amount of injustice in the world, we find ourselves wanting to do something about it. And we don’t want to do just anything. We want to participate in what can most strategically stop those injustices. We need to organize together to confront what is killing us and the planet. 
 If you go looking for others involved in this resistance work, you might stumble across some organizations that seem to have all the answers. They say they know exactly how to bring capitalism to its knees…</span>

What about a no-state solution? Self determination for everyone, no borders, police, or soldiers. A right-of-return for both Jews and Palestinians. —Pirate Prentice (2002)
The regime that will succeed the nation-state will not be the fruit of preconception or social engineering, but of sociological and political imagination wielded through transformative actions. —Gustavo Esteva (2003)

 The French firebrand Joseph Déjacque lived a short life defined by a wild and beautiful struggle against authority, a life of intense passion for freedom and genuine class war. Unlike many of the seminal figures of the anarchist movement, Déjacque was truly of the working class. Born in 1821, he was raised in Paris by a single mother, who had become a widow when he was very young, and he worked full time from the age of 12. His trade was house painting and wallpaper hanging, but as we shall see, he was an able polemicist and poet; his words were a shot of adrenaline to ra…</span>

 Until today, we knew that the mechanisms of repression of the state and capital were the army, the police, the schools, the psychiatric hospitals. Now we know that along with them have been added the Greek Cypriot ‘rapprochement’ state intellectuals and social-patriots. How else could we explain the fact that these gentlemen invite representatives from all the supposedly re-reunificationist areas to such a meeting — for represe…</span>

Title: Is there a non-colonial language in Cyprus? And if yes, should we all speak Eteo-Cypriot?

 No one can argue that language is not, at a certain level of analysis, a political tool. People in Cyprus intuitively know this, and that’s why I won’t go into the theory, but instead focus on the practical. 
 Language is political, and we, as individuals and groups, are doing politics. Sometimes consciously, other times less so. This website was also created by a series of political decisions, some of which quite conscious (it is a website which doesn’t limit itself to one part of Cyprus, even though the default option is to segregate). It is, among other things, a spirit…</span>

 The provocative show which took place two weeks ago, by members of ELAM (who also have a 5-year temporary contract working for the Cypriot national army) wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts in a cafe in Faneromeni square in Nicosia, could only get a dynamic antifascist response. By the time they were spotted in the square, a lot of people isolated them and threw them away shouting antifascist songs and showing them efficiently that there is zero tolerance in neo-nazism expressions. Why did all this happen? Why did a group of people attacked people wearing Golden Dawn t-shirts? Isn’t it a democratic right for anyone to wear…</span>

Subtitle: On the Usefulness of Jobs and Small Businessess for Illegalist Anarchists

 Anarchists sometimes need money: we need to pay our cell phone bills; buy bus tickets to the hopout; get enough money to buy the squat that we’re about to get evicted from. Some things are just hard to steal, like guns, or are only available online, like decent scanner radios or jamming equipment. 
 Individualist and lifestyle anarchists hold their nose and do legitimate work just long enough to get what they need, aiming for enough money to comfortably hit the road, hit the hay, or hit the target. 
 Socialist anarchists, on the other hand, are willing to engage in legitimate work, seeing it …</span>
